B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2UDS1E71QNSPA	A. Agyapon	I can't believe I just watched this movie for the first time! I'm sure I'll watch again and again. It really is new Christmas classic. They've struck a perfect balance between holiday film and love story. Even though there are a bunch of connected sub-plots it all works together quite well.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1OT7DSRMJ8PSK	ACD	Alright men. I get it. We're not really into chick flicks, especially something with &#34;Love&#34; actually in the title. My wife absolutely adores this film, and to date I have probably watched it with her more times than I care to mention. And as a man, I'm supposed to talk about how cliche or unrealistic some of the whimsical story lines in the movie are... but I'm not going to. Unfortunately, after spending so many nights on the couch watching this movie with my wife, it's become a piece of me as well. Yes, I can understand some of the critics. But it's story is really centered around honesty in love, and how it can appear out of no where. And there's truth in that. Our own love story didn't just happen overnight (as some do in the movie), but it did involve brutal honesty, awkward moments, grand gestures, and a spark that just doesn't make sense.And besides, nearly every girl in the world adores this movie. So if you want to score a few points, pick this up and surprise that special someone. I have a hunch she will return the favor.	5.0	One of our favorites	2013-12-18	1	0	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AAKGTWGAFT1LQ	A C SHIELDS	This is a film that seems to be a comedy , but not everything always works out in life . A lot of different stories are presented to the viewer , but none outstay their welcome .The great comic writer Richard Curtis is behind this film and it's about time they let him go behind the camera , as the amount of money his scripts have made for other actors would be quite scary .This is a romantic comedy with a little bit more depth to it .You are likely to know already if you like this film as you will go by the actors in it .It's a nice little diversion with some well placed music .	4.0	Not a realistic film , but designed to give that impression	2005-12-12	3	3	0
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3IAP2JMTP5YBN	"adriana ""alisa"""	I wrote a review earlier bashing Love,Actually. I honestly do not know what I was thinking, I must've been in a crabby mood that day or sumthin', because after another re-watch, I was absolutely delighted by this warm hearted, charming romantic comedy, that, like most romantic comedies leaves you feeling good afterwards.It takes on a few too many characters, and some of the scenarios are a bit improbable; but then again, what romantic comedy isn't guilty of this?As far as the acting goes, it is fantastic across the board.For me, I felt that Emma Thompson stole the show.She has a really beautiful scene set to a sad Joni Mitchell song in which she's all alone in a room on Christmas morning, and she's just found out her husband(Alan Rickman) is having an affair.The scene is wordless, but Thompson breaks your heart.It would've been nice to get rid of some little sub-plots, and spend some more time with the main characters.The film would've been exceptional if Curtis had done so.But alas, I'll settle for this very charming romantic comedy, that strikes all the right chords and is totally entertaining to watch throughout.While it follows the formula of every other romantic movie out there, there is a humanity,honesty, and realness found here that I have yet to discover in other romantic films.	4.0	Delightful Movie	2004-06-22	4	2	2

I may only watch it during the holiday season, but it is a very uplifting movie without some of the normally irritating romantic comedy quirks.  This holiday, I asked my boyfriend to watch it with me, and he actually LIKED it.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	ADRIENNE MILLER	Love Actually is somewhat sweet romantic comedy. I like the story between Hugh Grant and his tea lady and Laura Linney and her much younger beau but the rest of the stories were tepid. Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley ruin this movie, over-rated and stuffy actors who make little or no impression whatsoever. And those stupid scenes with those adult film performers really make this film feel forced. Love Actually is more about lust and misunderstanding than love. This one you can skip.	2.0	Love Actually, I don't think so.	2007-08-07	8	4	4

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A269ZQROQWEG51	A	Some beautiful scenes, interesting story lines (emphasis on the plural of storylines), but lacks a coherent, unified narrative -- even though one is attempted at the end.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AV45RVZRYH0T9	A. Kaplan	This film insulted my intelligence. 1) The opening lines about Sept. 11th are tasteless. Why use people who were innocently murdered to make a point in a movie's screenplay? 2) At least two of the relationships in the film consist of men in positions of authority over the women and should make any thinking person rather uncomfortable; 3) The president of the United States is portrayed pretty much as a serial rapist, not only unbelievable but extremely insulting to any thinking person; 4) The storyline about the friend with the crush on his best friend's wife who then stalks her, once again, should make any thinking person extremely uncomfortable; 5) The scene in which the coworker walks out on Laura Linney's character just because she receives a phone call from her brother is just not believable and once again quite insulting to any thinking person and 6) a child would not be able to run through an airport without being either physically stopped, or, unfortunately, maybe even worse!	1.0	Terrible!	2004-12-12	36	14	22

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A379SAP75SPDHD	Alec Solomita	Love Actually is a great romantic comedy and one of the best films of the year! This film is so rich with great characters, love stories and laughs to make it one of the best and most original romantic comedies made in a long while. There are at least 12 main characters whose stories are interwoven together to make a great love story or love stories. Hugh Grant as London's prime minister is a great fit and his story is probably the funniest. Grant makes every role better with his witty personality and seeing him dance around his house to the Pointer Sisters is hilarious. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman's story provides the most heartwrenching arch of the story as a comfortably married couple who gets shaken by infidelity. Emma Thompson is especially wonderful as the adoring mother and wife shocked by her husband's actions, yet strong enough to deal with it. Colin Firth's story line is the most sweet as a cuckhold who moves to a secluded place and falls for his Portugese maid. The most heartwarming part of the story goes to Liam Neeson, who plays a widow helping with his stepson's love life. Keira Knightley, Laura Linney and Rowan Atkinson also have parts in the story, as well as two porn stand-ins who fall in love while working together and a horny British guy who goes to America to find women. The porn stand-ins are great because they fall in love because they genuinely like eachother's personality, and people should stop complaining about it. They are probably the sweetest characters in this film. Bill Nighy steals the film as a has been rock star who sings a very cheesy Christmas song that is heard throughout the film. The movie's message of love comes through loud and clear and should not be taken lightly. Love Actually is actually a great film.	5.0	A great romantic comedy!	2004-01-02	28	22	6

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A10NI5VMX3HR3W	Alison	This movie comes as advertised---it's a feel-good movie about love and the fact that is is &quot;all around&quot; wherever you look, not just in the movies or in novels.  It's one of those movies that has about 10 different storylines going on in a large community of people, loosely connected to one another.  Each story is unique and entertaining.  The movie is long...over two hours, but if you like it, there's more than a half hour of deleted scenes, with director commentary, provided on the DVD version.  I watched the whole thing.  There is a great cast in this movie and the message is very simple...love exists if you just look around you and are willing to see it.  This movie leaves you with the feeling that you are going to fall in love tomorrow!	5.0	Love, actually, exists	2004-05-19	4	1	3

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1LMBOI3T91P87	Allan M. Lees	Any film that can assemble the breadth of talent that graces this offering AND permit each major actor just enough room to make his or her mark obviously has a lot going for it.  The roster reads like a who's who of British film, and the performances are highly polished. In short, this is a great product. Eight different love stories interweave (with Heathrow Airport acting as an anchor-point) and the film makes easy use of the kind of time-compression frequently seen in Shakespeare's plays (e.g. the action takes place over a few weeks but people accomplish tasks that would in reality take months). London itself also makes its presence felt - a glittery, clean London quite unfamiliar to those of us who've spent time there in real life. Many different kinds of love are in evidence: the love of a recently bereaved step-father for his step-son; the unexpected asexual love of an old reprobate rock star for his life's companion (his overweight male manager); the love of a man for his best friend's wife; the love of man for woman, of wife for straying husband.... and yet none of these summaries is really accurate, for each story, though sketched quickly, carries undertones. Although it would be easy to dismiss this film as lightweight, there are enough moments of pathos, of thoughtfulness, and of sheer charm to disarm all but the most curmudgeonly.  Seven of the eight love stories work their magic, so it would be churlish to complain that the eighth fails completely (for those of you wondering, it's the segment where a young Englishman heads to the USA and - quite unconvincingly - finds four beautiful young women who ravish him. This segment led me to suspect the writer had never actually been to the USA, where such behavior is about as likely as Neil Armstrong finding a McDonalds on the moon...).If you want an amusing, heartwarming product that is wonderfully devoid of violence and cynicism - basically the antithesis of vile concoctions like Kill Bill - then this is the movie for you.	4.0	Charming and satisfying	2004-06-09	3	2	1

There are more story lines showing much finer nuances of love but why spoil the surprise.  Wonderful actors including favorites Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, Colin First and Bill Nighy make this romantic comedy absolute pleasure to watch.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A37PV5GMP2ILJC	Amanda Richards	"This is the perfect Christmas gift to get any member of the group of free-loading moochers you call your friends.  It's the perfect excuse to have a movie night at THEIR house, and make them ante up some wine, cheese, grapes and lots of chocolate, then hunker down for an evening of cornball romantic comedy with a difference.Chances are, with Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman on show, you won't even notice that the storyline is hardly Pulitzer Prize material, but you do stand the chance of busting a seam when Hugh does his Footloose/Saturday Night Fever/Risky Business impression at Lot 10 Downing Street, and Bill Nighy makes like Robert Palmer for a video shoot of the worst ever chart topping Christmas song.  There's also the incomparable Rowan Atkinson, making like Mr.Bean at appropriately inopportune moments.In case you think it's all about the guys (it is - but one can't take sides) there's a brilliant performance by Emma Thompson, and also Laura Linney, who has the worst cell phone ring tone ever invented.  Keira Knightley is more ""Bend It Like Beckham"" than ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" in this one, feigning wide open surprise a little too often. She's cute though, even if I always get her mixed up with Natalie Portman, the Amidala girl.There are enough love stories and love disasters here to sink a luxury liner - and yes, there are ""Titanic"" references too.  Even though the couples are for the most part separate little stories, there's a connection running through the movie that really ties them all together.The music is great, the movie is funny, and your friends will have to entertain you at their expense - what more could you ask from a movie?

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3T6GMR57Z4NXG	"Amazon Customer ""Gadget Freak and Educator"""	"I could not believe how bad this movie was.  What romantic comedy elements there were were drowned out by paltry storyline after paltry (read:completely undeveloped) storyline, involving multitudes of movie stars, being thrown in the face of the viewer.  It was very much as if they were trying too hard to make a successful romantic comedy.  There was nothing at all romantic or even sentimental about these storylines and that they could expect us to suspend our disbelief with no plot depth at all was, well, unbelievable.More offensive than the extremely bad writing though was the gratuitous addition of pornographic material.  One of the many storylines crammed into the film is that of two ""actors"" doing a porn film who are apparently in love and when not filming oral sex scenes are going on perfectly innocent dates where both behave in a very shy and restrained manner.If there was an audience for this kind of story, it likely isn't all the same type of person who is looking for the next When Harry Met Sally and I wish this movie had, if nothing else, been advertised differently.  In fact, I wish I had never seen it and amidst my disgust at having purchased it, gave away my copy with a strong warning regarding its contents.Let's keep romantic comedy romantic and porn in the porn aisle.  Because if this is what happens when you get the genres confused, it just shouldn't happen.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1DAR2A8MJ141L	Amazon Customer	This Christmas time romantic comedy has a stellar cast list filled with Britain's finest.  Hugh Grant, Keira Knightly, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman all have starring roles.  Billy Bob Thornton also appears as the American president.This movie features about 8 different relationships that are loosely inter-connected.  The characters are falling in and out of love and this movie captures many different types of relationships (siblings, friends, the romantically inclined, etc) - most ending happily ever after at Heathrow airport.  The beginning may be a bit confusing as there are disjointed shifts from one relationship to the next and many characters are introduced in a short time span.  Once you figure out who's who the shifts aren't as annoying and you can see linkages popping up amongst the characters.  The acting is brilliantly done, the lines are humerous and all in all it's a movie that makes you feel good.Viewers should be aware that there is a fair bit of nudity in the film as one of the relationships blosomming is between two people involved in making a porn movie.	4.0	Cute and Funny	2004-05-09	1	0	1

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AJHEAIX7E68EV	Amazon Customer	I saw it first on TV and I was so intrigued by the concept that I watched it fully. At the end, I was amazed. For once, all the stories didn't end in a good way, which is rare. The movie shows all the kind of love you can feel (for you brother, for your co-worker, for your family, ...). It's a very good Christmas story, and even if at some point you can think the movie is a little cheesy, well, at the end, you just feel good and full of love to share.The actors are all very good british actors, which make the film even more intense. Well, if you're feeling down, just watch love actually.Oh by the way, the story with Colin Firth is one of the best. Just watch it.	4.0	Love actually is THE movie you have to see if you're feeling down!!	2007-02-08	4	0	4

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AH7HT8YRLTSQG	Amazon Customer	Ok, so I admit it. I thought this was one big romance movie, really I did. Then it hit me, love is not just what you feel as when you want to have a relationship with someone. It's what you feel towards your mother/father/sister/brother. It is what I feel for my kids, or that special feel I get everytime I'm in love with someone. It was great to see this in a film all the different sides to the feeling of &quot;love&quot;...Although I wasn't sure exactly what happened with Alan Rickman's (love that voice!) and Emma Thompson's characters, I think it means I will have to see it again.

My wife and I watched it when it arrived - the edited version was so much better!  There were a couple of scenes that were close to soft-core pornography.I really liked the theme of several couples and the people they love; Hugh Grant did a great job - the concert at the end was a wonderful scene.  Liam Neeson and his son were so charming - especially the running through the airport!  And the man and his housekeeper who couldn't speak the same language was my favorite of them all.I like the movie, but I wish it had been toned down just a bit with the unnecessary nudity.	3.0	Fun story but ...	2007-07-05	6	2	4
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2UU94ALK1RM5U	Amazon Customer	This is such a great flick with an awesome ensemble cast... Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Kiera Knightly, etc.  The best part about it to me is that it isn't your run of the mill, boy meets girl, they fall in love and live happily ever after romantic comedy.  There are several different stories going on over the course of the movie, and though they're all intertwined, they don't all have a happy ending.  Quite possibly the best part is watching a middle-aged Hugh Grant shake his booty to some 80s pop song, or sing Christmas carols to little girls in tiaras.  Oh, and there's also great music.  Watch it, you'll love it.	5.0	Not your typical gooey romantic comedy	2009-11-19	9	5	4

A veritable &quot;who's who&quot; of well known stars grace a collection of short stories, in funny, romantic, sad, and heartwarming scenarios, and the end result, though a bit muddled is cleverly handled. A real testament to the success of this movie after it's release was how well it was received here in the States, for being a fairly formula laden Richard Curtis written &amp; directed production. Some of the stories do stretch the boundaries of credulity a little, but the flavor of the Christmas magic allows even the most cynical viewers to be forgiving. The performances are ALL great, as seemingly the entire range of human emotions are played out before you in each individual tale, culminating in a clever, and touching set of finales. Some of the language will make this unsuitable for younger viewers, but good family viewing overall. Often very touching but never sickly sweet, this is a great DVD buy, and will be surely pulled out every holiday season, along with the host of other well known seasonal regulars.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1BIZGNAY9CBL5	A. Mc Clymont	"I love movies and normally every film will have some redeeming quality, so I always try to be positive and never critical. For example, Hostel was awfully, gratuitously, leave-the-theater gory, but it was also a great suspense story.But then there are dogs like Love Actually. This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. More than that: this film is embarrassingly bad.There are parts that I truly could not believe I was seeing. Makes you wonder about the moviemaking process, how a clunker like this makes it through the pipeline, but then again if people actually like it maybe the joke's on us... must be those consumers from Mars that Dave Barry talks about...I am not the genre's biggest fan but there are many fine romantic comedies. Four Weddings. High Fidelity.And this movie has many fine actors which to me makes the whole deal worse. It's just seriously unfunny, the situations are maudlin, repetitive, unoriginal, contrived and totally implausible, plus it tries to preach, sorry ""teach"" us something, and to top it off it has gratuitous ""grown-up"" scenes that add nothing at all (makes you think of a little kid when he learns his first swear words, look what I said!).Talking about little kids, to give you an idea of how silly this movie is, one running plot line has a 9 year old talking seriously (and continuously) about love with his father. This is so forced, silly and transparently viewer-manipulative as to be despicable.Unfortunately, it has to be seen to be believed. In my defense, my wife rented this and after a few minutes of jaw-dropping I was able to turn to a good book and watch this worthless waste of time unfold out of the corner of eye and ear.I am saddened by the positive reviews this movie has received on this site. I can't believe anyone wouldn't see right through this clunker."	1.0	Embarrassingly bad	2007-03-08	51	26	25

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	There is a lot going on in `Love Actually'; a whole lot.  That is a good thing, for that means that there is more to love, and love I do, for `Love Actually' is kind of like the ultimate romantic comedy.  The film revolves around eight couples (not always in the most conventional sense) as they strive for love during the holiday season.To get into every aspect of this film individually would take too much time and space, plus it would take away from the whole surprise and joyous mystery of the film, but I will touch try and outline the plot a little.At the center of the film there is the young prime minister who has become smitten with his caterer.  His sister is having trouble in her marriage, for her husband has fallen prey to the young office temptress.  Her best friend Daniel is dealing with the death of his wife and raising her son (his stepson) Sam, not to mention finding some solace.  Then there is Jamie, who is going through a rough patch in his love life when he catches his girlfriend in the arms of another man.  Young lovers Juliet and Peter are trying to get their marriage off to a good start, and Sarah is trying to find love while juggling other responsibilities.  Add to this a washed up rockstar on the verge of a comeback and workmates (working in very compromising positions) and a young Brit who dreams of American girls and you have, in a nutshell, `Love Actually'.You'd think that this may be a little much, but it works, really, really well.  Each couple actually finds some sort of closure to their story, even if it's not the typical happy ending we are hoping for (I'm looking at you Sarah).What makes this film work so beautifully is above all else the script, penned by first time director Richard Curtis (who made a name for himself writing `Four Wedding's and a Funeral').  He wonderfully shifts the focus of the film from character to character without ever losing the audience or taking away from his characters.  Each group or couple or individual is given their opportunity to shine and engage us.  Sure, some couples are given more scenery to chew, but the audience will never feel jilted in any way.And then there are the brilliant comedic (and dramatic) performances by the entire cast.  Truly everyone is outstanding and to single anyone out in particular seems almost cruel, but there is no denying that Bill Nighy steals the show as Billy Mack, the washed up rocker who is battling the popular boy band for billboard sales.  His comedic timing is brilliant.  Other actors who shine are Colin Firth and Liam Neeson and Laura Linney who all capture the loneliness that comes from abandonment and or responsibility and they do so magically (especially Neeson and Linney).  Emma Thompson is marvelous as Karen, wife to Rickman's Harry; the husband with a wondering eye.  Hugh Grant is always superb, and Martine McCutcheon matches his humor beautifully.  I know I'm missing some, but I would be just foolish to miss Thomas Sangster who turns out a beautifully well rounded and sincere child performance that captures his youth and not a Hollywood fabrication of childlike maturity.As the films final frame comes into view the audience feels fulfilled, albeit a little stuffed, but it's a good kind of stuffed; like the feeling you get after holiday dinner.  There's a smile on your face, a little food on your chin and this overwhelmingly warm feeling in the pit of your stomach that lets you know everything is alright.	5.0	This movie is love...	2008-08-22	4	2	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A31L29N79KRHN5	Andy Brandt	"This is a very nice romantic film, it has just the right proportion of laughter and seriousness. And for this kind of movie it is surprisingly serious without being really sad. It indeed shows love in its various dimensions and kinds, far cry from silly ""and they lived happily ever after"" seen so much in romantic comedies.And it does so with great acting by top notch actors. Hugh Grant being cast as the British Prime Minister is one of my favorites, I think he fits the role perfectly with all the subtle allusions to the cabinet current at the time the movie was shot. I also love Alan Rickman's performance and his characteristic way of speaking. Emma Thompson is also great playing his wife, her acting skills especially admirable in the scenes where she conveys deep feelings without saying a thing.Also some of the less known actors make great performance, like Abdul Silas playing Tony, the down-to-earth friend of the guy who went to Wisconsin looking for love (BTW Richard Curtis surely did not see Dogma beforehand). It turns out it was Abdul's first movie.I really like to watch ""Love Actually"" to lift my spirits a bit. Not necessarily around Christmas.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2QHM5HBSIXRL4	Andy Orrock	"If you're on the fence about seeing 'Love Actually,' perhaps you're not aware of the pedigree of writer/director Richard Curtis.  He's been the guiding hand - in one way or another - behind a remarkable string of movies...Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones' Diary (and the upcoming sequel to that).  Plus, as long-time collaborator with Rowan Atkinson (the various incarnations of 'Mr. Bean' on small- and big-screens), the guy knows how to stage physcial comedy.So, it's no surprise that 'Love Actually' is (mostly) a triumph.  There's a lot going on here; some of the stories are stronger than others, most notably the tale of married couple Alan Rickman (fantastic here) and Emma Thompson (who is looking more and more like Hillary Clinton with each passing day).  There's a brilliant bit of serious acting here by Thompson locked away by herself in her bedroom.  Grade A stuff.From a comedic standpoint, the movie is absolutely stolen by the incredibly gifted Bill Nighy as 'wrinkled rocker' Billy Mack.  If you've never seen Nighy do his schtick (check out his over-the-top performance in ""Still Crazy""), you're in for a real treat.  Plus, his holiday rendition of ""Love Is All Around"" sets the tone of the movie from the opening scene.  It pops up over and over and never wears thin.Hugh Grant is the surprise here as a Blair-like British PM (without the Cheri).  I know he can do the serious stuff.  Check out his sublime performance in 'About a Boy' - the bumbling, stuttering Grant persona is nowhere to be found.  The eye-openers here are twofold:First, Grant was quoted during ""Two Weeks Notice"" that he ""doesn't do physical comedy,"" and would leave that to 'Two Weeks' co-star Sandra Bullock (the best physical comedienne in film today).  However, here he is shaking his booty through the halls of No. 10 Downing St. to the Pointer Sisters' ""Jump.""  It's quite good stuff.  Grant has sold himself short all these years.Second, there's this one bit of politicking that Curtis slides into the movie.  Grant meets with the US President (Billy Bob Thornton is a stellar cameo in which he oligeneously combines the worst qualities of Bush and Clinton).  Expected to parrot the U.S. line in a press conference, Grant ferociously blurts out a statement of independence.  Curtis' less the veiled intent here:  ""Message to Tony Blair; don't be anyone's poodle any longer.""  Frankly, the only way this scene works is via Grant's ability to deliver those lines and have it seem credible.  He does that.  You never doubt him for an instant.  For anyone with an interest in the U.S.-Britain 'special relationship,' this scene alone makes 'Love Actually' worth checking out.  It'll spark hours of conversation."	4.0	The Curtis pedigree wins out...Love + Politicking, too	2003-11-20	7	5	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A13NM1PES9OXVN	"Angela Mitchell ""Angela Mitchell"""	"(Note: SPOILERS!)So here I am, a lonely voice in the minority here, but I just didn't love this at all, and think it's sloppy, average, and kind of insulting, actually. I was so disappointed, because I really liked ""Notting Hill,"" and am a huge fan of ""Blackadder.""The movie has some good points, and of course some absolutely fantastic actors and performances.  But half the storylines feel cliched, smug, and rushed, while the other half are either unutterably depressing, unbelievable, or just plain insulting.What I disliked the most was this really strong aura of sexism, and in kind of a nasty way (and I'm cringing to even write this, as I know it sounds oversensitive and all that).But really:  most of the men who are in love in this (Grant, Firth, the guy in love with Kiera Knightley, even the little boy) are in situations where they literally have yet to say 10 words to their dream girls. They just ""love"" from afar.  But that's not love, that's lust, dudes.And of course all the women who are adored are hotties (even down to the gorgeous miniature Mariah Carey the kid likes). Even Colin Firth's maid has to strip down to her undies, in a totally contrived scene, so that we can see that even this unlikely person actually has the body of a swimsuit model. (And that doesn't even count the idiot who goes to Wisconsin and promptly gets invited into a foursome by some idiotic but gorgeous (of course) model-type American girls. I kept waiting for this part to be a dream -- it's that jarring -- and was shocked it was actually supposed to be believable.)And hey, everyone likes pretty people on film so no problem normally -- but when so many of the women seem to be subservient to the men -- the maid, the PM assistant, two secretaries, lumped in with some dumb-as-dirt US bimbos -- a pattern does kind of emerge. (Ever notice how almost ALL of Curtis's ""romantic"" storylines -- even in his other movies -- are about men who are in ""love"" with a woman they barely know?)Add to this the constant fat jokes and the movie has a weird slimy undertone to it. Especially when most of these jokes are directed at a beautiful girl, the object of Grant's crush, who is just simply not fat at all. She's probably at worst a size 8.  How does that make his attraction ""brave"" or unique as it is evidently supposed to be? Even her coworkers are cruelly cavalier about this (invisible) weight problem (and yes there's more name-calling), and when Grant visits her at home, what do we see but that the girl's father, too, calls her rude fat-girl nicknames.I would get it, I guess, if she was actually fat, even in movie terms (like the chubby and still adorable Bridget Jones).  But she's not.  And then the movie has to end with yet another slew of really cruel fat jokes yet again, this time at a character's very heavyset sister.I guess my point is, where is the love?  What's so ""love""ly about a bunch of guys lusting from afar, two desperately unhappy women, a little boy who is striving for the school hottie (to the extent that he -- AND Dad -- show no sign of missing his just-deceased mother at all).... etc.? Ironically only the porn stand-ins have actual conversations (and I actually thought their storyline was charming, if completely unbelievable -- same with Firth's - as well).But on the flip side, Laura Linney's story is incredibly depressing and unrealistic to boot. In real life, there is simply no way this woman could not have (1) a normal romantic relationship, or (2) that a truly nice or deserving guy, as her crush is supposed to be, would not understand her need to take a phone call, or to cut short a date (if it is actually ""love,"" shouldn't he be more understanding?).  But instead this guy cannot even wait 5 minutes for her to finish a phone call to her ill brother -- she has to be doomed, dramatically, to an unhappy ending that is completely unbelievable (and a real downer of a message too).If you look at all of the stories, the only one that is actually about love is the one about the aging rock star's realization that his most loved friend is his long-suffering manager. Most of the other stories were superficial to the point of caricature, and those that weren't, and that ironically actually featured interesting women, like the wonderful Laura Linney or Emma Thompson (both fantastic with the limited stuff they are given to work with) -- were treated to cruel and really depressing outcomes.Even Alan Rickman's unpleasant and unworthy storyline is yet again simply about lust, for his transparently eeevil secretary. If this subplot had to happen, I would have been a lot more intrigued if instead we showed this man torn by real feelings for another woman -- not just ""oh I'm in lust"".  (But nothing in the movie is that deep, so oh well.)Again, all this would be fine except for the title. How is this the ""love, actually"" -- the love that's all around?  All I see is a bunch of talented Englishmen embarrassing themselves over women they think are hot stuff, but that's it.About the bookends with the airport (and monologue about 9-11) -- I don't mind the reference to 9-11 as some here do (I will always be touched by that memory of the English playing our national anthem the next day, in tribute), but I do think it has to be earned. And Curtis didn't earn it.  He didn't write a movie about love being ""all around."" He wrote a sloppy, muddled and occasionally semi-funny movie about a bunch of highly professional men who spend much of their time gazing and drooling adolescently from afar.  The families in the airports are deeper, more touching, more real, than any of Curtis's silliness (and that's unfortunate).Anyway. It's cute on the surface. Fluffy and harmless, lots of pretty people, ancient pop tunes, happy-happy-joy-joy (and I know some of you are already pressing that ""don't recommend"" button on this review, mentally telling me to ""shut up, it's just a movie"" - LOL).  But it's a little creepy too, a little depressing, a little sadder and meaner than it needed to be.  Actually."	2.0	Didn't Love it, Actually...	2006-06-24	113	89	24
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AMKMQ78UHE7YN	"Angie ""Catholic homeschooling mom of 5"""	"Contrary to the stars and acclaim I've read, my opinion is that this is one of the worst movies I have recently seen. It was recommended to me by a family member (ugh!) and I will warn those with a more ""sensitive"" palate in movies to avoid this one. There are several instances of graphic nudity and sexual simulation as a couple making a ""porno"" fall in love....how nice. Other issues include: affair contemplation, anti-American sentiment, every American portrayed is an orgy-throwing single-minded individual, coaching a pre-pubescent into the arts of sex with abandon to ANY morality, and actually little ""love"" other than the anticipation of bedding someone. I had much higher hopes based on other movies these actors/actresses had previously been in.One sub-plot that had some blossoming of love was the Colin Firth romance that came about, but that a man's maid is going to strip to her undies to retrieve some papers out of a pond is a bit far-fetched.Another romance is between Hugh Grant as the new Prime Minister and his caterer. However, her personality waffles between meek and shy and a cursing flirt making the romance beyond physical attraction difficult to follow, to say the least.Rowan Atkinson has a decent part and probably the only comic relief was during the elaborate wrapping of a necklace, but that humor is dampened by knowing it is for the girl Alan Rickman is contemplating an affair with while his wife buys Christmas presents.All in all, I consider this very poor British soft-porn with very little ""love""... actually."	1.0	"Rethink ""Love"" Actually"	2007-02-15	45	23	22

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3VN1UOD89ET49	Anne Jelliff	"Don't bother with this movie.  Really.Ignoring the advice of a friend who pooh-poohed it, I watched this film because I am a (somewhat casual) fan of several of the actors who appear in it and was curious.  Please believe me when I say that my friend was right - it is a complete waste of your time.I don't say this because the story was pointless. (What story, really?  Eight or nine (?) subplots so tenuously connected that I was not even sure by the end of it how everyone knew everyone else.  How am I supposed to feel any connection with people when I'm still trying to figure out their names etc. two hours later?)I also don't lay the accusation of pointlessness because none of the subplots actually worked, although that charge is true as well.  (For example: The Colin Firth character is supposed to experience a shocking, heart-wrenching break-up with a woman, leave the country to work on a book, get over said cheating/heart-breaking woman, meet a woman who speaks only Portuguese (of which language he knows not a word), say good-bye to her and return home, learn Portuguese, then fly back to find her and propose marriage (delivering this proposal in Portuguese - which he just learned)...all before Christmas day...yeah...right...And I'm the Queen of New York.My main gripe about this film, though, was the horribly gratuitous level of sleaze - and I literally mean that it was gratuitous.  There were many instances (scenes, comments, conversations) that had nothing whatever to do with even the story-line of the sub-plot itself - neither forwarding action/informing the audience of new events, nor enhancing our knowledge of the characters (at least not in ways that could not just as easily, and more artistically have been accomplished by other methods).  The sex (lots of it - much of it disgustingly crass) was just there for the sake of it...and mysteriously, everyone in each scene apparently saw it as completely acceptable, or funny, or so commonplace as to not merit comment.  There were quite a number of scenes in this film after which I found myself wondering ""ok, why did I need to see that?""The end result was that by the time the closing-credits were rolling, I had written off so many of the characters as either uber-shallow or as complete dirt-bags, that there were really only two characters that I liked - one was the kid (who was probably only saved from dirt-baggery by his age, and therefore implied innocence) and Emma Thompson's character (who is a Joni Mitchell fan, God bless her) and she turned out to be one of the victims of a love destroyed.... (Merry Christmas!!!)I am a pretty hopeless sucker for a good romantic comedy - the category under which this movie was billed.  That is a misnomer.  It is not funny enough to be a comedy, and it is not at all romantic.  I think the director was trying to portray all the different (and often unexpected) ways that love can manifest itself in ordinary (or not so ordinary) life.  But I've seen real love in many forms - and that's not it.  The only true thing the director ended up showing us is that he (and anyone who loved this film) can honestly say with Joni Mitchell that they ""really don't know love, at all."""	1.0	A Truly Awful Movie	2010-09-28	36	20	16

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2KJJEZVMJ9BB1	Anonymous	We received this movie as a Christmas gift.  We attempted to watch it while the kids were watching another movie downstairs.  We forced ourselves to watch the first half hour before we decided it was so not worth our time and the title had nothing to do with the movie - except for the first scene, at the airport.The great line up of performers gave us false hope in thinking this was going to be an entertaining movie.  The lack of storyline listed on the back cover should have been our first red flag.Some of the storylines could have been made into something worth watching - like the stepfather/stepson relationship or maybe even the Prime Minister and his secretary. But because they jump around between so many storylines (mostly shallow and self-serving, oh, and don't forget the porn dropped in for what, shock affect?) it was way too difficult to make sense of any of it.  Porn is not our thing and has NOTHING to do with love, neither does a guy who thinks he's a sex-god but constantly complains he can't get a girl.Whoever thinks this movie portrays LOVE has never experienced true and lasting love.  This distorted view of love is a major part of the reason our world is in the state it is in.  True love is about self-sacrifice and putting someone else before your own desires.  IF you actually want LOVE, in the true sense of the word this is the wrong place to find it.Love, actually, has nothing to do with this movie.  Hard to believe but Wall-E is a better romantic comedy.  At least the two robots put each other first and take care of each other.  The kids had the better entertainment option for the night.  Lucky them.	1.0	Anything But Love Actually	2009-01-03	26	12	14

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2EL3990HXOMZB	Antonio Robert	"Building on the pattern of contemporary British comedies of manners -- starting with ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ending, hmmm..., wherever near Bridget Jones and ""About a Boy"", this mega-romantic mega-comedy encompasses almost a dozen of 'love stories', of which some are truly romantic, some just cute and some outright stupid. Each single character is distinguished clearly in their situation and so the viewer should not have problems with getting lost inside the mix, but it's the sheer star power that saves the movie. Emma Thompson is once again wonderful, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant are everything you may expect from them, too. Laura Linney stars in one of the few episodes here that don't end much on the sunny side and youthfully luminous Keira Knightley is truly a sight for sore eyes not only for Mark (Andrew Lincoln) who thought he was gay. The cast also has some surprises in store, like singer Martine McCutcheon, and cameos by Billy Bob Thornton, Claudia Schiffer and ubiquitous 'Mr.Bean' Rowan Atkinson. Notable is the role of Bill Nighy (as the ageing rocker Billy Mack), who was awarded as best supporting actor by both British BAFTA academy and Los Angeles critics. The film at times tests viewers' sensitivity to profanity and suggestively sexual (although disguised as funny) scenes. This aside, it's intelligent and romantic entertainment, enhanced also by a stellar soundtrack (including songs from Norah Jones, Sugababes and Mariah Carey)."	4.0	Actually, Too Much 'Love' Here (3.5 stars)	2004-03-17	0	0	0

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1PPLR2BLCFW57	A Reader	"With such an exceptionally talented and for the most part beautiful cast, one wishes to confess a sense of embarrassment about the utter tastelessness, cynicism, and stupidity of nearly every moment in this overly long film. What prevents this feeling from coming to fruition is the extent to which most actors in the ensemble convey their own nudging, winking awareness of how dreadful their dialogue and implausible the dramatic context of their work here is. The entire production conveys an air of the Stockholm syndrome; half the cast seem to have been brainwashed into believing the treacle they are declaiming is actually comedy, while the other half seem to be blinking SOS with every close-up.Make no mistake: this is truly a manipulative and hateful film. Under the guise of Christmas, a ludicrously affluent roster of petulant and self-indulgent Londoners--who would make the cast of Woody Allen's no-less hateful film Match Point look like a group of extras from Cry Freedom--lie, betray one another, confess their cynical manipulativeness, and are rewarded generally with consequence-free sex and all-is-forgiven good cheer. Ebeneezer Scrooge has a better sense of ""the true meaning of Christmas"" than the director, Richard Curtis, of this film.If there is one story-line and actor who could be said to redeem at least his own camera time--less than 15 of the 135 minutes of the total--it is the ingratiatingly cynical Bill Nighy, whose jaded rock-star character constantly expresses both his contempt for an audience that would actually listen to his music while desperately hoping that his recording (of a Christmas carol, needless to say) will be a hit. He telegraphs the essential message of this movie, which has nothing to do with love, actually, and everything to do with cadging profits from spectators alleged to be too stupid to understand the difference. The climax of his story, when on Christmas Eve he decides to abandon his rock-star lifestyle in order to get drunk with his manager and watch porn, strikes a note of near-nobility not because it substitutes for the relentless conventionality of the other on-screen romances, but precisely because it doesn't (and can't).By contrast, particular distinction goes to Alan Rickman, who phones in the most lifeless, lugubrious, and preposterous performance of the ensemble as an executive who wishes to bring his employees together romantically--there are by the lights of this movie NO restrictions regarding workplace sexual harassment in England?--while ostensibly grappling with an office romance of his own as Emma Thompson dutifully stays at home minding his picture-perfect family. Although he deserves credit for offering perhaps the most Brechtian performance in a Romantic Comedy since Charlie Chaplin in The Great Dictator, one is confused by the end of the film as to whether he is in fact the film's undertaker or its cadaver.Speaking of Brecht and the Great Dictator, no review would be complete without calling out the obvious, scandalous ease with which Richard Curtis exploits the still-fresh occurrence of the 9/11 catastrophe and the just begun Iraq War to inject Hugh Grant's unctuous portrayal of a bachelor British Prime Minister with a fraudulent political consciousness AND a crudely jingoistic caricature of the Anglo-American alliance. Yes, in a world where Hugh Grant could be a convincing substitute for a British Prime Minister, Billy Bob Thornton's cameo hybrid of Bill Clinton's leer and George W. Bush's sneer could be a convincing parody of ""the ugly American."" But if one doesn't buy the former, one won't believe the latter either--and the ugliness of both gives the lie to the film's claim to portray ""love.""While writing this review I struggled to decide not how many but how few stars to award it. The fact that it doesn't even descend to a one-star rating, but stands slightly redeemed by the other, better achievements of its ensemble--with the exception, perhaps, of Hugh Grant, who doesn't seem to have any work outside of his collaboration with Richard Curtis in films even more forgettable and pathetic than this--is itself evidence of this film's resilient and enduring mediocrity. There are many, many romantic comedies shorter, funnier, and sweeter than this. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor: DON'T."	2.0	Neither Actual Nor About Love...	2012-09-24	19	3	16
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3L32E2N58QXZQ	Area Woman	Is it the wonderful acting by the excellent ensemble cast? Is it the fact that it looks at love in so many ways? Is it because it lacks the regular, &#34;boy meets girl, or girl meets girl, or boy meets boy, they have some problems, but in the end everyone gets together&#34; baloney happy endings that so many other romantic comedies have? Is it because at the end of the film things are not neat and tidy for all the characters involved? That's probably why I love this film. It is a very messy film, full of messy, inept, confused, mistake-prone characters. I love it because people have died in the film and people have lots of hang-ups that block them from getting what they want, and because people do stupid things in this film, which is what happens in real life everyday, but they still manage to find some kind of love. It may not be the love they wanted at the start of the film - but it is some kind of love. There are not many films that have expressed love, love of family and friends and romantic love, in some of its many permutations, quite so well.	5.0	Why do I love this film so much?	2014-02-14	1	1	0

It's a refreshing romantic comedy-- one that ties together several different love stories that can all be traced back to the Prime Minister, played by Hugh Grant.Some of the love stories include a young boy who is in love with the most popular girl in school, a man in love with his best friend's wife (or the best friend as implied in the beginning), the Prime Minister falling for his secretary, and a writer who falls for his cleaning lady. Some of the love stories (though none of what I mentioned) could have been left out. Some were just a bit much, like the story about the couple who met doing body double work on a film. The scenes are just awkward, and not just because their nude the whole time. Otherwise, the stories create a nice woven effect throughout the film and are incredibly enjoyable and laugh out loud funny.It's well-written and the cast is absolutely amazing. We are charmed with the presence of Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightly, and many more.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2C27IQUH9N1Z	audrey	Director Richard Curtis has a charming vision of love surrounding us and affecting everyone's lives in a multitude of ways.  He also has a terrific all-star cast.  What he does not have is a script worthy of either the vision or the cast.  While the film is enjoyable in a breezy way, several of the many story lines are superfluous or gratuitous, and often situations and lines are much too predictable.  Hugh Grant is, of course, charming in his blinky way, and Emma Thompson is terrific, but the most consistently good scenes go to Bill Nighy, who shines as a comeback rocker, charming Brits with his profane comeback attempt.  Grant, Thompson and Nighy rise above a trite script, but others don't fare so well.  This is not an evil film.  I don't resent the time I spent watching it.  But it is a shame to have such a nice idea and such a talented cast wasted over this cliched script.The dvd extra features are good, and include a commentary track with director Curtis and stars Nighy, Grant and Sangster; 37 minutes of deleted scenes; 8 minutes of music; and a Kelly Clarkson video,  The film can be heard or subtitled in English, French or Spanish.Chances are, if you like these stars or this premise, you will enjoy the film, but it's not as good as one would hope.	4.0	crowded but charming film about love in its many guises	2004-05-07	0	0	0
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1SSA0MF161794	Ava Barbi	"I nearly slapped a measly two stars on ""Love, Actually"" because of sheer disappointment over the charming, sexy Hugh Grant receiving only a handful of scenes in which to shine.  After putting my hormones in check, however, I changed the rating to four stars because the movie is at turns an effusive celebration of, and introspective meditation on, life and love.  And, with human beings committing increasing violence against each other, against wildlife and the environment, we need as much of a love infusion as possible.If any of you out there are expecting Grant to channel Cary Grant in delivering many brilliant and adorably clumsy lines, think again.  He is not the cad of the ""Bridget Jones"" films; nor is he the shy lad of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral.""  But luckily for Hugh Grant's fans, in ""Love, Actually"" he has lots of fun portraying a hip British prime minister with the penchant to dance to The Pointer Sisters' ""Jump.""  While his flirtatious behavior with staffer Natalie is politically incorrect, their inevitable romance is consensual and a joy to watch unfold.  (And whoever decided to script Natalie as a plus-size woman, single mother and a desirable mate should be commended.)More than a few of the vignettes in ""Love, Actually"" had poetic overtones in the manner of the Pablo Neruda-inspired ""Il Postino"" -- the major theme being The Unobtainable.  No matter how many times I watch the ""Love, Actually"" DVD, I am deeply moved by the story involving the British novelist (the normally stoic Colin Firth investing this role with unusual vulnerability).  After catching his partner in the act, the writer spends in solitude what is supposed to be a romantic vacation for two in the countryside.  Just as frustrating as trying to complete his book are his futile attempts to avoid falling for his attractive Portuguese housekeeper.  The scenes depicting the pair's efforts to communicate in either language are treated with humor, sensitivity and realism.  What happens after his manuscript is swept away is worth the price of the DVD alone!In another interlocking story, a philosophical schoolboy with more profound statements about unrequited love than any ""Peanuts"" comic strip has surprising lessons for his bereaved stepfather (who is portrayed gracefully by Liam Neeson).Then there is finely nuanced acting in the person of the great Emma Thompson.  She is memorable as a devoted wife and mother (and sister of Hugh Grant's prime minister) just trying to hold it together for her children while her spouse (as slyly embodied by Alan Rickman) fools around at the job.  A clever plot twist leads to the unforgettable discovery of the infidelity, and it takes a tremendous actor such as Thompson to mine the depths of emotional complexity required to make the viewer sympathize with her pain.  That moment in ""Love, Actually"" reminded me of Diane Lane's disquieting scene in ""Unfaithful"" on the commuter train.  Why does it take infidelity -- whether a husband's or a wife's -- to provide an exceptional actor the opportunity to display such spontaneous psychological fragmentation?On the lighter side, director Curtis' well-choreographed montage of love stories is set to an exquisite soundtrack.  In keeping with the film's holiday theme, the ebullient rendition of ""All I Want for Christmas"" is more than fitting.  The adolescent singer who performs the song belts out the lines with such bell-like clarity, she personifies joy in its purest meaning and would make Mariah Carey proud.My only gripe about ""Love, Actually"" is that it fails to explore love's impact on older adults and on gay and bisexual men and women. I am not risking giving away one of the storylines in commenting that it would have been more riveting if it had been allowed to take a homoerotic rather than an obsessive direction.If you are the romantic type and enjoy dry British wit, consider the ""Love, Actually"" DVD (the widescreen edition) as a gift for yourself at any time of year.  The DVD also would make a nice stocking stuffer at Christmastime but only for an adult because the movie contains nudity and mature themes."	4.0	Cheers for This Romantic Romp!	2004-10-21	0	0	0
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1R602SXNGOMJ4	A. Vegan	"It has been a long time since I have seen a movie so rich in character that I did not want it to end. Love Actually is not a love story, it is a story about love. Love that reinvents itself, multiplies itself, opens itself up, and even devastates.I love this film. Despite the clearly fantastic story lines, I like the characters, and the amazing A-list cast does a great job.""Love Actually"" is a delightful homage to love. There are different situations, some of them dramatic, others funny, sometimes touching but never corny. The interconnection of the stories has a perfect timing. The cast is a constellation, highlighting the shining beauty of Keira Knightley and the nice role of Hugh Grant. There are many wonderful moments, such as the collective interview of the Prime Minister and the American president; or the moment when Karen finds that her Christmas gift is a CD of Joni Mitchell; or when Mark declares his secret love for Juliet; or the relationship of Daniel and Sam; or when Daniel meets Carol; or when the manager of Billy makes a comment about Elton John; or the narration in off in the beginning of the movie. I believe I could list many other magnificent moments, but better off the reader of my review rent or buy the DVD and have a good time."	4.0	Surprisingly Enjoyable	2006-04-08	1	1	0

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2ELT9NS0Q8W9L	babydoh	Love Actually is a wonderful movie in all respects.  Its cast, script, and direction are all absolutely top-notch.  Set at Christmastime, the story encompasses numerous plots, all of which are equally interesting and effective in leaving one on the edge of one's seat, waiting to see what's going to happen with each group of characters next.One of the most wonderful aspects of the film, in my opinion, is how we eventually discover that every single one of the vignettes is interwoven.  For example: one story is about Karen (Emma Thompson) and her husband (Alan Rickman).  The latter, although certainly not without affection for his wife, has begun to dabble in infidelity - thanks to his attractive secretary.  Working with Rickman's character is Sarah (Laura Linney) who has been desperately in love with her co-worker Karl (unfortunately, I can't recall the actor's name, but he does a nice job) for years.  And then of coure there's David, the prime minister (Hugh Grant) - who just happens to be Karen's brother.Wonderful performances are also given by Liam Neeson (as a recent widower), 13-year-old Thomas Sangster (as Neeson's young son), Rowan Atkinson (who does a hilarious job as Rufus the Jewelry Salesman), and in one of the best vignettes, my personal favorite, Colin Firth.This is an extremely funny and extremely touching movie.  As usual, I hesitate to give away too much more about it.  Nothing, and I repeat, NOTHING, should deter you from seeing it.	5.0	Lovely actually	2004-01-29	2	1	1

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A11K83SZ0W14CE	"Barbara L. Pinzka ""Book Friend"""	Love Actually is a very Brit film that follows almost 10 couples who are in some stage of a relationship and showcases them in a six-week period.  Added in is a storyline about an old-time rocker who makes a surprise comback with a catchy Xmas song.While I give the uniformly excellent cast highest marks, there are simply too many storylines and too many improbabilities (for example, a PM falling for a secretary and making like Tom Cruise in Risky Business at #10 Downing St) and coincidences to make the film believable -- and I do believe in coincidence, having been part of many that startled me.(One of my favorite stories, however, depicts a couple who meet as stand-ins performing graphic nude scenes for big stars in the flicks.  When they decide to date, fully clothed, they instantly become shy and embarassed.)As the relationships vary a lot in one's likely level of interest, Love Actually can drag at times.  Nor do the filmmakers bother to offer any genuine surprises in the plotting.	3.0	Muddled but Occasionally Very Good	2006-08-09	2	1	1

He doesn't have the social skills or the brain cells for the job. His crush isn't what most of us would consider love, actually. At the end of his segment she runs up to him in public and jumps on him with both legs wrapped around his waist. Look at Grant's face; he doesn't quite believe it himself.None of the relationships had time to ripen. The story tried to tie up all the segments into a nice Christmas pageant bow at the end, but it didn't quite work. And there are seriously depressing fates for 2 or 3 of these couples.

Caulfield ""writer on the verge"""	"I loved this movie because it had all kinds of different romantic situations, because everyone connects to everyone else in some way or another.  I also love how it seems all the great British actors of today were gathered together for one film, such as Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson--just to name a few--even if the Prime Minister (played by Hugh Grant) does take a few stabs at Americans.  I can overlook that.I found the nudity scenes to be a bit much, but like another reviewer point out, it shows that you can find love even in the most awkward of situations.  Each situation of love seems to be something someone can relate to.  There's the man who loves his wife, but is tempted by the secretary at his office and his wife finds out; the man who is in mourning after the death of his beloved wife, and there's his stepson who is suffereing from that wonderful thing called unrequited love.  Then there's, what breaks my heart the most, the love that can never be due to certain circumstances.  The movie is wonderful and can even be enjoyed with your spouse! To the women out there, your guy will assume this is a complete chick flick but my husband fell completely in love with this movie!I was a little disappointed with the bonus material.  There's a Kelly Clarkson music video ""The Trouble With Love"", which is good because I really like the song.  There are deleted scenes, which are a bit drawn out because there isn't a menu to pick a scene and each deleted scene started out with an introduction from the writer and director, Richard Curtis.  There's also another feature, The Music of Love Actually, which lost my interest pretty quickly.  There's also a feature commentary with a few of the actors and, of course, Richard Curtis.  I have yet to watch that, but those are usually pretty enjoyable.  I'm a sucker for making-of featurettes, and I was disappointed there wasn't one.I give the movie 5 stars and the bonus material 3 stars."	4.0	Love everyone can relate to!	2005-01-07	5	4	1

This is how I describe it to people who haven't seen it and assume it's a romantic comedy (it is not): This is a movie about love. Love, as we all know, is complicated, is not planned, and it does not always have a happy ending. In addition, love comes in many forms, not just romance. This movie portrays all the faces of love: first love, unrequited love, love taken for granted, friendship and unconditional love. The movie follows several story lines, but it never feels choppy or confusing. It is quite funny, and it features a really strong cast.

Where I've lost count of how many times I've seen ""Four,"" once was way too much for this sappy, hammy contrived piece of drek. Where the writing in ""Four"" was smart, clever, quick, original, witty and well written, this one was overindulgent valentine from the class dork who spent too many times home alone dwelling on his lovelorn fantasies. Plausibility, just throw it out the window. Situations one can relate to? You're joking, right? And the sap-o-meter would have been at the 10 scale from start to finish on this movie. There's a few scenes with Emma Thompson where there's genuine warmth and heart injected into an otherwise vehicle set up for endless ""Awwwwwwwwwws!"" She puts legitimacy where I didn't think it could be found. Outside of that, there isn't one other side vignette that I found interesting or acceptable in any way. Hugh Grant could have used a little assistance in the writing category. And little Thomas Brodie-Sangster had all the childish realities of a home defense system designed by Kevin McAllister. Except he reminded me less of Caulkin and more of Longfellow. What a reach this character was!

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AT54Q2ERA4PBR	Ben J Korgen	"This movie is unusual in the immense size of its cast and in its multiple-plot structure. Within a cast of about fifty people, over a dozen play starring roles.  This might sound like a recipe for disaster, but somehow it works beautifully.  The basic idea behind this effort consists of using many male-female pairs of actors to portray the many different kinds of encounters and outcomes that can occur and result when male and female humans find themselves in close proximity to each other.  The outcomes of these multiple relationships are tremendously varied and best thought of as scattered along a spectrum ranging from tragedy to ecstasy.  The movie does not present one complete portrayal, then a second complete portrayal and so on until the movie's end.  In contrast to that ""stepping stone"" approach, the movie actually introduces a bit of the first portrayal, a bit of the second and so on through to the last portrayal, then starts over with a second bit of information on the first portrayal.  In other words, the movie repeatedly ""tunes up"" the viewer's understanding of how each relationship is progressing.  Although the movie treats most of the portrayals as of equal value, it places greater than usual emphasis on the relationship that builds to a thrilling peak involving the Prime Minister of England (Hugh Grant) and his voluptuous office assistant Natalie (Martine McCutcheon).  In a serious portion of the movie illustrating the character of the Prime Minister's work, The President of the United States (Billy Bob Thornton) arrives and proves himself full of assumed superiority and entitlement rights to insult or flirt with anyone in his presence.  The interactions between the actors playing the President, Prime Minister and Natalie are brilliantly portrayed and leave me thinking Thornton is an acting genius, even when playing a mildly despicable person and even when he wears a John Deere cap while playing semi-dumb during interviews."	5.0	Richard Curtis Directs Hugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon In Exceptional Romantic Comedy	2013-10-20	2	2	0
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1O3D323KNPOMP	Ben Merritt	I have never written a review on Amazon... or anywhere else for that matter, but this film compelled me to do just that.Whilst I can appreciate that it will not be everyone in the world's favourite film, I can, with my hand on my heart, say it is definitely mine. There was so much emotion involved, I came out a weak, pathetic excuse for a man!The all-too-widely-banded about term 'Romantic Comedy' fits this film very well, but the term itself is too over-used with lesser deserved films to warrent labelling Love Actually with it too. Unfortunately, 'Romantic Comedy' is all too often a synonym for 'wishy-washy' and 'time-filling'.This film is so much more. This film had me crying with laughter at the funny bits, crying with sadness when relationships weren't working out and crying with happiness with they did.In 21 years of my life, I have never cried watching a film (give or take the odd Disney movie ;-)This film, for me,was perfect. Something that angers me slightly is the number of people on this site critisizing the film for having too many plots and too many characters. Come on, if you're going to see a film like that, you should be an adult - everyone I went with had the brain capacity to watch it, completely understand it and thoroughly enjoy it for being an intelligent film. The number of plots was fantastically easy to understand (more so than a majority of films I've seen in the last few years) which is testament to the ability of Richard Curtis.I also think that Americans are at a slight disadvantage when watching this film - there are so many hidden, inside, English jokes in this film it is unreal. Another reason is because so many of the actors on the film aren't really known to American people (unless they've watched The Office or Teachers etc.). English people between 19 to 35 would find this an incredibly funny, intelligent and heart-warming film - and a refreshing change to the habitual 'Romantic Comedies' out there.Highlights for me where Martine McCucheon meeting Hugh Grant for the first time and swearing - by accident; the acting ability of the step-son; and the simple 'Ant or Dec' line, which literally had me on the floor laughing.It makes you want to grab the person you're with when you leave the cinema - or better still - find the one you fancy, and tell them how much you like them.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AK7CAW3N1XZV6	"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth"""	The premise of this movie is that despite all the violence and hate in the world, LOVE actually is everywhere you look. The movie proves this point with the telling of eight interconnected stories and an amazing cast that includes Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Laura Linney, Hugh Grant, Billy Bob Thorton, and an incredible child actor, Thomas Sangster. The setting is London in the weeks leading up to Christmas, and the various tales are a skillful combination of sweetly uplifting and poignantly sad. It is a rare movie which succeeds in being heartwarming without being sappy, and in that respect, Love Actually thrives.The movie, though long, has so much going on that it is easy for the viewer to sustain attention.  However, the DVD release includes three deleted scenes.  While I do believe that these provided some additional insight into the characters (I especially enjoyed the extra interplay between grieving husband Daniel and his stepson, Sam), given the length of the movie, it is understandable why the scenes were left out.  Regardless, director Richard Curtis does an excellent job bringing the movie to a stunning, uplifting, and emotionally gratifying conclusion.  This is a modern-day romantic comment perfect for mature audiences looking for something a bit beyond the traditional boy-meets-girl, and I highly recommend it.	5.0	A modern-day romantic comedy with an exceptional ensemble cast	2004-05-03	0	0	0

This is a second remastering for Blu-Ray. It is very well done, with excellent detail in the picture. The sound is also very well done, which is important with a movie with as much music as this has. The ornament is, well, cheap, but hey, you're not going to buy it for that, right? This is a worthwhile upgrade from the DVD, with plenty of improvements. It also includes the DVD and a digital download, though the standard download is not very good quality.	5.0	Great release!	2013-12-08	2	1	1

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A25HYPL2XKQPZB	Bill Garrison	Love Actually is a romantic comedy designed to make you feel good then forget about it right after you watch it.  It follows several people as they pursue love over the Christmas holidays.  All of these characters are somewhat related, but none of their stories really intertwine.With so many stories to tell, it's like the movie shows the climax of several stories at once.  Even though there isn't time to develop characters, that isn't really noticed because the love stories take center stage over the lives involved in the stories.Hugh Grant is the leader of the stellar cast and plays the British Prime Minister who falls for a staffer and gets to cut down the US and its buffoon president (a role in which he makes the US President look like a womanizing fool without paying homage to Clinton or Bush).  Almost every kind of love story is told and the movie magages to hold your interest for the entire two hours.There is a lot of nudity and bad language, so kids shouldn't see this film.This is a charming movie and I recommend it.	4.0	Feel good movie with no depth	2004-05-10	2	0	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1WSQK3SB76RCC	Blake Wood	"My wife rented this one night and brought it home for us to watch. My initial reaction was lukewarm, but I was in the mood for something a little different. Well, I was totally blown away by how much I loved this movie! And I'm a guy! I really liked this movie, from start to finish. And what a finish! All of these different characters and storylines, and they all wrap up so nicely in the end! I ended up really caring about all of the different plotlines, and they are about 10 of them! Well, only one I could have done without, but that still leaves 9! And, for me to care that much about 9 different storylines in a movie says something. This movie put me in such a good mood afterwards, I recommend it to anybody who has lost their faith in the power of love. I now have the DVD and I have watched it 3 more times already! What a heartwarming, ""feel-good"" movie! And the different emotional payoffs that occur as the movie starts to wind up are really done well. I have to give this movie a 5 star rating, it's just that good!"	5.0	"""A most pleasant surprise..."""	2004-11-25	4	2	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1KJA4TD91GLO5	Bozeman	This has been one of my favorite movies since the day I saw it in the theater.  Shamelessly happy.  Shamelessly optimistic.  Shamelessly beautiful.  Funny, funny, funny.  Not unflawed, but still perfect.By the way, this movie is rated R, and the MPAA wasn't kidding around.  Apparently (and I know this will shock you), there are some people who will deliberately watch a romantic comedy they know is R-rated, and then get all in a tizzy because of the swearing and sex.  These people must do this because they get initially confused by the R-rating and assume that an R-rating merely means violence, like people getting beheaded or eaten by aliens, and such things would of course not be nearly as upsetting as swear words or the sight of pasty English people without their clothes on.Oh, there's also a diatribe scene against a hypothetical US President who is like the worst of Clinton and Bush.  Lot's of people see this, get their American pride wounded, and resolve to hate the rest of the movie.  You see, Americans would never put anything in a movie that was disrespectful of the British -- that's why we've never randomly given British accents to the villians, prigs and nitwits in American movies.  I mean, honestly, have you ever seen that happen?  I sure haven't.	5.0	Top Ten All-Time	2006-09-04	4	2	2

Specifically I enjoy watching this movie every year during the Holiday's. The movie is truly a romantic comedy that will pull at your heart strings in one scene and then have you laughing hysterically in another scene. The movie follows multiple couples throughout London during the Christmas season as they all are looking for love. Martine McCutcheon and Keira Knightkey are down right beautiful and funny in their respective scenes. Allen Rickman is great as always as the boss of a small company. The stories of all of the couples are intertwined nicely. If for some reason you haven't seen this movie yet you need to buy it immediately as it will be a movie you will consistently watch year after year. This movie is a must watch during the Christmas season along with my other perennial favorite National Lampoons Christmas Vacation.**********Spoiler Alert***********There is no way I can pick a best scene from this movie but between the opening shot of the Heathrow Airport Visitors, to the restaurant in Portugal, to the ""Carolers"" who visit Keira Knightley this movie will always be great."	5.0	Great Romantic Comedy/Christmas Moive.

The characters fall in love predictably and with as much melodrama as two characters running towards each other on the beach in slow motion.

This is possibly the best romantic comedy ever made. It seems scientifically engineered to contain something for everyone. You've got unrequited love, interracial romance, political elements, exotic locales, older couples, adultery, complex family commitments, attractive American women, lobsters, nudity for the guys. I've watched this with dozens of people and everyone loves it.

While the this excellent movie IS so, because it has a truly wonderful ensemble cast, fine acting from all, and a really great script... I must say that it is NOT entirely a romantic comedy as the description makes it out to be.  Yes, most of the characters do win at love by the end of the movie, but three main characters noticibly DON'T, and if you've ever been in their similar situation [which I won't go into since I don't want to ruin your viewing pleasure!] as I have, you may feel somewhat or very 'down' by the end of movie.  The heart-breaking Jonie Mitchell song ""I've looked at love, from BOTH sides now..."" [emphasis added] is very aptly used in this movie.  I suppose this movie makes the point that in one's life romantic, fairy-tale love may not come, but one needs to be constantly aware of opportunities to grasp it before it disappears if it does show up.  A great movie, in many respects, best viewed not at Christmas, or not when one is 'alone'."	5.0	"""(A) Look at Love... from both sides now..."""	2009-12-30	3	1	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3SJ2VSCHZB18	Brian Markowski	"There are so many problems with ""Love Actually"" that I don't know where to begin. There's the obvious. It's a Christmas movie devoid of any religious message, rather it revels in life's carnal appetites. One character flies to Milwaukee, Wisconsin  and ends up having group sex. Another couple meet on the set of a soft porn film, while other characters of this film have a Christmas cocktail party under giant posters of naked men and women covered strategically by Santa hats. Then there's the not so obvious,  Colin Firth's character, Jamie, learns basic Portuguese in less than a month. A young boy, Thomas Sangster,  learns to plays drums in less time than that. Then there's the whole Prime Minister business. None of it makes any sense, so why do I love this movie so much?Let's start with the plot, and it's a loose one, it's five weeks before Christmas and a dozen or so people in London live out their lives over the holiday season. There's the newly elected Prime Minister played by Hugh Grant who's attracted to a worker in his office, there's the aging rock star, played brilliantly by Bill Nighy, trying to make a Christmas comeback, there's the husband (Liam Neeson) who just lost his wife and is struggling not to loose his connection with his son as well, then there's the business owner (Alan Rickman) who's contemplating an affair and so on and so forth. The stories operate, for the most part, independently but also interconnect, even if it's in some small way. It's a killer cast that pulls this off, aside from the above mentioned we are treated to performances from Emma Thompson, Keira Knightley, Laura Linney, Billy Bob Thornton, Rowan Atkinson, Elisha Cuthbert, and  Martin Freeman from BBC's ""The Office'. The story and direction is brought to us by Richard Curtis, who's previous screen writing work includes, ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill"". ""Love Actually"" is his first foray into directing and though it's a tad uneven at times, Curtis pulls off a complicated maneuver by communicating these multiple stories while giving us a satisfactory, if not sometimes silly, conclusions to all of them.The extras are decent, a number of deleted scenes fills in some of the questions a viewer might have after watching the finalized film, it makes me wonder if a director's cut isn't too far down the road. There's also a music video by Kelly Clarkson, who sang a song for the film. The commentary is enjoyable in a boys night out sort of way, as Richard Curtis, Bill Nighy, Hugh Grant and Thomas Sangster gather around the mike to laugh at Colin Firth's manly walk and lovingly acknowledge the physical attributes of some of the female cast.The movie works mostly because there is no theme other than love. Love connects the characters, love is what's lost or won in the end, and love is what makes the audience relate. That's why we don't care that Thomas Sangster learns to play drums in two weeks. He's doing it for love. That's why Colin Firth learns Portuguese. Or why the Prime Minister is willing to make a fool out of himself. And it's why this movie has become a holiday tradition for me, it's just too bad I can't share it with my kids until they turn 17."	4.0	Can a Christmas Movie have swearing, naked faux sex, and  a British accent? Absolutely!	2006-12-28	4	3	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A5IAXUYLNIJV5	Brian Sawyer	Since I'm not a huge fan of romantic comedies, I probably would not have been very interested in seeing Love Actually, if not for the fact that it was written and directed by the genius behind Four Weddings and a Funeral, Bridget Jones's Diary, and Notting Hill (which I only consented to see based on my appreciation of Four Weddings and which I was surprised to have enjoyed). But knowing this, I did actively seek it out at my neighborhood multiplex, and I was glad I did.Love Actually is a fine film, and I recommend you see it. It does follow the format for a basic romantic comedy, but it does so with more sensitivity and depth than most movies in that genre. While much of the movie is laugh-out-loud funny, it also has quite a few heavy moments (think the poem read during the funeral scene in Four Weddings) and complications that remind you that relationships succeed or fail for a variety of reasons, few of which are ever generic or obvious. None of the story lines are simple boy gets girl or girl doesn't get boy sort of situations.Almost all of the many distinct, intertwined characters and story lines were crucial to the movie. Though I can think of one story line that could have been dropped without losing too much, only one character's story really hurt the movie (it's not one of the central story lines though, so my disappointment with it is proportional with the screen time it was allotted). In all, I think you'll find that at least an hour and fifty minutes of the two-hour movie will have been time well spent.Now I can't wait for The Edge of Reason! Since Colin Firth played Bridget's love interest in Bridget Jones's Diary, I'm particularly interested in seeing how they handle the fact that Colin Firth, the actor, has such an important part in the sequel. He's central to the funniest scene in the book.	4.0	Loved It, Actually	2004-02-19	2	1	1

Excellent intertwining stories, casting, writing, acting, and music gave me everything I wanted in a movie and more.  The storyline dealing with the unfaithful husband, however, did not resolve itself as suggested by Livetoact1404.  At the very end when the wife picks her husband up from the airport after his business trip it is clear she doesn't trust him and says she's &quot;fine&quot; in the same &quot;put a good face forward&quot; manner she used Christmas Eve, and when she says let's go home, the sarcasm in her voice at the use of the word &quot;home&quot; is pointed.  In any event, while not all storylines end like a fairytale they really shouldn't have, and the movie, overall, is still wonderfully uplifting.	5.0	Review and Response to Livetoact1404	2004-04-29	1	1	0

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	"One of the more interesting movies of 2003, Love Actually is a hilarious, romantic, emotional rollercoaster chronicling the effects of love on an interconnecting web of individuals. Filled with a number of memorable scenes, yet completely ignored by the Academy Awards, Love Actually is the type of film enjoyed by a wide array of people. I have yet to meet anyone who didn't like it, which is saying a lot considering this could fall under the category of ""chick flick"". But what makes Love Actually a successful film is its ability to identity with each audience member on a personal level. Each character is easy to relate to, and the multiple storylines are surprisingly easy to follow.Starring a plethora of Hollywood stars and starlets (Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, etc), Love Actually follows the lives of various loosely connected characters as they struggle to deal with their love lives in the hectic month leading up to Christmas. Set in London, England, the film is a collage of various lives. The central character is the world's most eligible bachelor, the new Prime Minister named David (Hugh Grant), a powerful man who falls in love with his newly hired personal assistant Natalie (Martine McCutcheon), but can barely summon the courage to tell her how he feels.The film also follows the life of the Prime Minister's older sister Karen (Emma Thompson), a woman struggling with her husband Harry's (Alan Rickman) possible infidelity with an office co-worker named Mia (Heike Makatsch) who she knows is after him. Meanwhile, Karen confides in her male friend Daniel (Liam Neeson) who is concerned about the strange behavior of his young son, who he later finds out is in love with a young girl in his class - a girl who will soon move to the United States. Rounding out the storylines are a writer who catches his girlfriend cheating and moves away to France where he find new love, a secretary who questions her love affair with an office co-worker she's wanted for years, a photographer smitten with his best friend's new wife, and a pair of porn stars who develop a relationship after filming a number of scenes together (many of these sequences are hilarious). To top it all off, one young man moves to Wisconsin were he believes girls will stand in line to make love to him. Love Actually features a multitude of eccentric and lovable characters the audience gets to know, and each character crosses paths in the final moments of the film, projecting a very uplifting message about life and relationships.But the show stealer of Love Actually is Billy Mack (Bill Nighy), an aging rock star desperate to climb back to the top of the charts. He achieves his goal by means of a wildly outlandish and funny personality that puts him on radio and TV shows everywhere and leads to his indescribable song ""Christmas Is All Around"" taking the country by storm.With a likeable cast of characters, and a multiplicity of viewpoints (pessimistic, optimistic, young & old, etc.), Love Actually is a refreshing film boasting a little bit of everything. It's a film that will make you laugh, make you sad, and in general, provide you with a good feeling when it's all over. For that reason, Love Actually is a definite must-see film.

The acting is wonderful, and the stars bring their skill and charm and the characters to life.  Hugh Grant is at his most charming, but the other actors are perfectly cast and bring this charming story to life.Alan Rickman was so subtle and perfect, his scene calling the girl about the Christmas gift?  Perfect.  Ditto Emma Thompson after receiving the CD instead of the jewelry, breaking down, and then courageously pulling it together for the kids.  Just perfection.Yes, it shows on TV occasionally, but in an edited version.  Watching the uncut movie was much better.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2VDN6OJOIY74W	"B. Sloane ""dotalbon"""	"What's most enjoyable about Love Actually, besides the terrific scoring (inventive use of pop songs to bridge from one story to the next) is the inspired casting.  Along with wonderful comic bits from Bill Nighy and the actor playing Colin (those two alone were worth the price of admission), several gifted actors do themselves proud. Case in point: Sarah, hopelessly in love with a co-worker and emotionally strangled by caring for her brain-damaged brother, could have been a bathetic mess in the hands of anyone less talented than Laura Linney.  I was also impressed with Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, totally believable as a married-with-children couple who deal with each other comfortably on an everyday basis, but who are thrown for an emotional loop over an office romance.  And Colin Firth (okay, I do have a teeny crush on this guy and am not totally reliable as a critic!) is the only actor I know who could convincingly sell the writer-loves-housemaid story.What's less satisfying is the director's overreliance on his stock-in-trade story resolutions.  Curtis always has to include a mad dash for the airport to get two characters together -- in this movie, there are TWO mad dashes -- and Prince Charming must always rescue Cinderella from a drab life with a dramatic flourish (in this case, two Princes, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant).  Curtis uses his gimmicks with charm and skill, but they still feel gimmicky and one longs for more surprises.Two other minor carps: (1) I am willing to suspend disbelief long enough to pretend that an 11 year old boy can learn to play the drums expertly in two weeks, but I refuse to accept that on the very night of the big show,  he's still in his room learning the basics.  (2) If Hugh Grant is cast as a P.M. in his late 40's or early 50's, for heaven's sake put a little gray at his temples or something.  Grant looks 25 here, negating the intended older man/younger woman aspect of his relationship with Natalie and rendering Emma Thompson's greeting of her ""big brother"" late in the movie a little silly.One final comment, not on the movie itself but about some of the reactions to it:  I'm bemused by the postings that claim  Curtis' casual use of interracial couplings represents some sort of P.C. gone amok. This demonstrates a complete ignorance of the British sensibility on race.  Class differences are everything in British culture, NOT the black-white divide as is the case in America.Those who see a ""left-wing agenda"" in a totally unpolitical movie like Love Actually could vastly benefit from learning something of other cultures and mores, as well as checking their own biases in the mirror."	4.0	Good acting, enjoyable for the most part	2005-06-10	16	14	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AGCOCRW8A56U8	buddyhead	Finally, a love story that doesn't try to get everything right.  Love, Actually is a collection of interwoven tales about people falling in and out of love that is ambitious, intelligent, and only rarely clich&eacute;d.  The film is as completely unrealistic as a good romance ought to be, but not in a way that panders to the audience; plus, the clever script doesn't take itself too seriously, and the hard to swallow scenes are as much of the laugh-out-loud variety as the aw-shucks type.There's enough realism in most of the scenes to obviate completely suspending disbelief, and the film honors practical themes: some love is better left unrequited, and not every crush needs resolution.  Timing and Fate can play as much of a role breaking up unions as creating them.  Love isn't always pretty or fair, and manifests in the form of an aging rocker rejecting glitz and groupies to spend New Year's eve getting blitzed with his longtime manager, a guy falling for his best friend's new bride, and the British Prime Minister tempting scandal for the affections of his young aide.The star-studded cast delivers, and the wide variety of scenes prevents any character from wearing out his welcome.  As with so many great British comedies, Rowan Atkinson cameos.	4.0	Perfectly Imperfect	2006-12-28	3	2	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2YALLK1XG52FS	Bufford D. Moore	A prologue: I am not into romantic comedies...at all. Having said that, let me say this: I really enjoyed this movie. A sort of three ring circus, it follows a number of relationships from unrequited love ( a man who loves a friend's wife), puppy love (an absolutely charming depiction of a schoolboy crush), lost love ( a woman who can't follow through on her attraction to the office hunk), found love ( a housekeeper who doesn't speak his language), and the love of a true friend ( A burned out rock star who discovers his real love). There's more, and done really surprisingly well given all that's going on. Hugh Grant does what is perhaps his best smaller part as the Prime Minister who realizes his love for an unlikely staffer.I realize that this is a cliche, but this is a movie destined to become a Christmas standard.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A18ERV74XFXTM3	"Candy ""yalegirl03"""	I found this movie very disappointing. It tries so hard to be cute and funny, stuffing over 5 different love stories into one short movie. What we get is a set of underdeveloped one dimensional characters, underdeveloped plot lines, and ultimately a very forgettable romanitc comedy. Frankly, I felt it was a waste of time and money. The only redeeming parts were Colin Firth's appearance (although he was on camera far too little) and the cute love story with the little elementary aged boy and his crush. Some stories that needed development were left to shrivel up.

It certainly make no pretenses at being anything other than it is, a charming, sometimes funny and touching way to pass a couple of hours.  It's true that about three of the plotlines could have been dispensed with completely, and it would have been a better, tighter movie.But for me, this was made up for by absolutely superb, smart acting.  Neeson can do such amazingly delicate emotions for such a big, imposing man; Firth gives himself over deliciously to the absurdity of loving someone who can't understand his language; Thompson is heartbreaking as Rickman's wife, fearing his infidelity, yet stubbornly holding everything together; and however unlikely Hugh Grant seems as PM-- let's face it, he was a pretty unlikely book store owner, too--  he's become such a sly comic actor that it hardly matters-- he's just funny.I don't see if anyone has mentioned the DVD extras-- the film commentary is done by Curtis, Bill Nighy, the young man who plays Neeson's stepson, and Hugh Grant-- and the highlight of that is certainly Grant's persistent ragging of Colin Firth.  Curtis eggs him on.  ""What do you think of this actor?"" he asks.  ""VERY BAD,""  Grant intones solemnly.

As Christmas nears, many different characters couple or uncouple amid the emotions and fuss of the holidays.  The creators look at just about every variation of love possible, from sexual lust to puppy love to friendship to realistic couples to Cinderellas and their Prince Charmings.  The pace is brisk, the cast so lovable that you don't realize quite how long the film is or how flimsy most of the storylines are.  Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson and Laura Linney will break your heart.  Hugh Grant and Colin Firth make the most of their charm.  Bill Nighy does an outstanding job as a bad boy over-the-hill rocker doing a come back, and while his story doesn't exactly hang with the others, it helps level the overall sugar content.As long as the film runs, it was once 1 1/2 hours longer.

The ""starrage"" there is even lower than it is on the U.S. site and the first reviews I saw were titled ""Utter Rubbish"" and ""Awful Film."" Then I saw ""Richard Curtis, You are Now Giving British Cinema a Bad Name."" That seemed to be a repeated sentiment on the site. So much for the British being in love with this film. Some liked it, but many, many did not.It takes a fleeting attention span and a lot of suspension of disbelief to enjoy this film. It needs an editor.

Just as I was getting into a storyline I liked (hilarious Billy Mac, for example), wanting to see more, the movie would switch to some mundane, fomulaic sitcom story (Mr. Prime Minister Hugh Grant usual schtick or kid who doesn't seem to care that he just lost his mother--he just wants to hook up with the school babe)  The characters are given so little attention, they come off as superficial and the storylines absolutely unbelievable. The film is forced to rely on embarrassingly simplistic stereotypes and silly sentimentality instead of sharp humor and unique looks at love in modern times.I wasn't bothered by the nudity, language or even the slam at U.S. politicians (Does anyone actually believe the Billy Bob character WAS just George Bush? C'mon. And, if this movie had come out during the Clinton administration, you guys would be singing its praises - don't be hypocritical. Plus, American media is constantly poking fun at British politicians, royals, etc. We should be able to take a little ribbing ourselves).  I just thought it should have been smarter and more engaging.I'm a little surprised at some of the reviews that either knock or tout this as being clearly British, because my thought when I saw it was that this film tried to be just British enough, but in reality was way too Hollywood. A British friend of mine cringes at this film and said to make it clear that it is not a true representation of the British. I absolutely love some of Richard Curtis' earlier work (Vicar of Dibley, Four Weddings), but the newer films (this one, Notting Hill), seem to play to a market that wants a bit of quasi-British flavor, but mostly standard Hollywood junk. Actors well-known to Americans, glamourous model looks and no personality for the lead actresses, simplistic storylines, yuppie-esque sets. It's a real shame.This is worth a rent and a viewing with the fast-forward button ready. But, it leaves a lot to be desired."	3.0	get ready to suspend disbelief	2005-07-19	22	17	5

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A25NW2AYG3NLO0	Children's Book Lover!	"I genuinely loved LOVE ACTUALLY when I saw the theatrical version in December.  It helped that I was in London, and I had a great date with me, and it was snowing outside, and there were little twinkling Christmas lights all along the street outside the cinema, and we'd just walked through Notting Hill to get to the theatre . . . so I was really in the mood for this film.Admittedly, this is a great popcorn movie.  Entertaining.  Enjoyable.  Delightful.  It doesn't require a great deal of intellectual  investment, but it probably has one of the greatest casts of English (and American) actors assembled in one film since ""Gosford Park.""  So, it was perfect for a Saturday afternoon.Admittedly, there are a lot of illogical moments.  (For example, one would think that the Prime Minister of England would have easy access to the address -- and last name -- of one of his senior household staff, rather than having to tromp up and down a cold, dark street, knocking on doors looking for her on Christmas Eve.)And although the staggering number of intersecting plotlines could understandably overwhelm, I came away from the movie feeling that Richard Curtis had artfully woven an endearingly warm and fuzzy quilt around us, affirming that, still, ""love is in the air"" amidst a very complicated world.In short, not a deep thought-provoking film, but not a bad way to spend a snowy London afternoon cuddled up in the cinema.The feature commentary on the DVD, unfortunately, destroyed a lot of that illusion.Curtis and Hugh Grant were obvious choices as two of the commentary participants.  But given the size and pedigree of this cast, it's surprising that they weren't able to come up with more interesting co-commentators than Bill Nighy and nine-year-old Thomas Sangster.Nighy was wonderful in the film, but his self-deprecating comments in the commentary pretty much destroy the cocky on-screen persona he had so memorably created on screen.As for the talented young Thomas Sangster, he too was marvelous on screen. But it was inappropriate to have a nine-year-old boy participate in the running commentary of this film.  I am no prude.  The nudity and sexual content of LOVE ACTUALLY did not phase me at all . . . in fact, it was essential to the twisting and intertwining plots which tell such a story of contemporary love in today's society.  But rewatching the entire film while a nine-year-old boy viewed it with three wise-cracking men in their 40's and 50's made even me uncomfortable.  At one point, even Richard Curtis says ""So Thomas, how does it feel to be watching a movie that, legally, you can't even get in to see.""  Perfectly said, and they should have thought better.As for Hugh Grant . . . . I have always really liked his performances, including in this movie.  And living in England half the time as I do, I thoroughly understand that razer-sharp English public school (i.e. private boarding school) banter and humour (which is often at the expense of others.)  But in his commentary, I did not understand Hugh Grant's non-stop trashing of Colin Firth.  The first few remarks were funny. The next six, not quite so.  But two and a half solid hours of continuous bitchy remarks by Mr. Grant about Mr. Firth -- whose performance was one of the most heartfelt in this film -- became really irritating and downright rude. And for me, it really was counter to the warm feelings and hopeful spirit the film claims to trumpet and portray. It was, perhaps, meant as good-spirited fun, but it came off as vicious sniping at a colleague and a fellow actor.Most disappointing, however, was Richard Curtis' commentary itself.  What I previously thought had been a fresh, interesting  , and well-thought-out directorial masterplan was obviously, instead, a shoot-from-the-hip scramble, by his own admission (Well, he's still a great writer.)All-in-all, this particular commentary illustrates that filmmakers and actors should remember that a commentary becomes a viable and permanent part of their film's persona once it is released on DVD, and that they should be thoughtful not to destroy or lessen the illusions and patina they had created in the film itself. It's no joke, even in a lighthearted film.The DVD does showcase a couple of deleted scenes which perhaps  SHOULDN'T have ended up on the cutting room floor -- most notably the hilarious segment where Emma Thompson and her son (a talented young man whom you otherwise barely notice in the final cut) are called to the Head Mistress' office over one of the most innovative Christmas Wish essays ever written.  It is (or would have been) probably the funniest scene in the movie.The movie on DVD is still, of course, the movie, and it's still great fun, and completely enjoyable.  My advice, though, would be to avoid the commentary, and just stick to the deleted scenes.Oh yes, and one last thing . . . this DVD does eloquently allow the viewer to watch, over and over, the subtly nuanced performance of the magnificent Emma Thompson, who I'd say is one of the greatest actors on the planet.  Her anguished, wordless scene, standing next to her stark, coldly-lit, empty marital bed, is one of such moving, gripping emotion that you almost have to avert your eyes, since you feel you are intruding on a moment of such deep, private pain.And you have to give Curtis credit for those moments, as well.Even wordless scenes are written, and even brilliant actors such as Thompson have to be directed and captured on film."	3.0	IF YOU LOVED THE MOVIE, AVOID (SOME OF) THE DVD	2004-04-29	8	5	3

I wanted to turn it off after 10 minutes and only watched because I couldn't believe how bad it was. I'm amazed at the positive reviews here. Have we become this stupid? What hope have we of getting decent films made when the public go overboard for this trash. It should have been good. It was a good idea. But EVERYTHING about it was bad. We should be asking for our money back, demanding a remake that took more than twenty minutes to visualise.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3DSTOJPRMV674	"Chris K. Wilson ""Chris Kent"""	I rented &quot;Love Actually&quot; last week and watched it with my girlfriend. The film, released at the theaters last year, was not even my fourth choice. But when one is in a relationship, one finds themselves having to make compromises. In this case, the compromise turned out to be a pleasant surprise - though my girlfriend did fall asleep halfway through.Anyway, as I watched the fairly complex plot threads slowly weave their way towards a predictably syrupy conclusion, I found myself contemplating this film a bit more than expected. I'll try to cover the bases without boring readers to death.First and foremost, &quot;Love Actually&quot; boasts an extraordinary cast of actors, many of whom are from Britain, the location of this valentine of a movie. Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Laura Linney and Colin Firth, among others, lend an air of respectability to the mainly light proceedings. This ensemble piece examines eight varieties of relationships, all of them involving a form of love.Richard Curtis wrote and directed this romance/drama/comedy, and it was his first time behind the lens. His previous work included the charming screenplays to &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (a favorite of mine), &quot;Notting Hill&quot; and &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary.&quot; After such notable success with the pen, I suppose it was about time for him to sit in the director's chair. He does an adequate job with a fairly daunting screenplay. Not only must this story weave in and out of the lives of 10-20 individuals in modern-day London, but it must walk a fine line between comedy and drama, giving each notable actor enough screen time to flex their professional muscle.The misfires are many, as the budding love between the porn stand-ins strikes the harmonious note of a wooden nickel. This talkative pair, in various forms of undress, pretend to perform lustful acts while cameramen set the lighting meters prior to the actual actors doing their &quot;business.&quot; The odd couple make a date and literally shiver during their first kiss. The symbolism is too obvious - yes Richard, we know lust and love are two entirely different things.The slovenly Colin, played with nose-picking intensity by Kris Marshall, couldn't find love if it punched him in the face. So the 20-something man decides to travel to America in search of drooling babes entranced by his British accent. Colin lands in snow-covered Milwaukee. Within minutes he finds three single models who take him back to their penthouse to have an apparent romp. Granted, British accents are cute, but I'm not sure it's going to give any man the inside track to winning the fantasy lottery.Liam Neeson is terrific as a recently widowed father attempting to raise a young son on his own. By utilizing the power of positive thinking, he is lovingly supportive, and it's just a wonderful turn by an actor who normally plays the &quot;hunk.&quot; I liked this vignette immensely and would enjoy seeing a film dealing simply with this father and son relationship.Hugh Grant does a nice turn as the recently appointed Prime Minister of England who's shot by the Cupid's arrow upon meeting the caterer of his new home. Grant goes to great lengths to deny his love for this lower middle-class woman. This vignette gives us one of the finest scenes in the film when Grant stumbles upon a Bill Clinton-like president of the United States (nicely played in a cameo by Billy Bob Thornton) trying to make a pass at the caterer. Grant's character has already been bullied by this important world leader. Now the prez is making a move on the love of his life! Grant stands up to the powerful man during a press conference, and the enjoyable scene will make one swell with British pride whether they live in Olde England or not.The strongest scenes in the film are delivered by Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, as a longtime married couple. Rickman is being flirted with by a young woman at work, and Thompson catches wind of it. Her scenes where she deals with the infidelity are the most memorable of &quot;Love Actually.&quot; This very fine actress reveals the true trauma of what such shenanigans can do to the victim. She delivers the best line in the film when she says to her longtime husband, &quot;You haven't just made me look foolish, but you've made us look foolish.&quot; Thompson's work is nothing short of brilliant.What I liked about &quot;Love Actually&quot; was it dealt exclusively with ADULT romance. Amazingly, there's not a teenager in sight. This is also such a sweet, life-affirming film, without a single moment of cynicism. To me, that's rare in today's movie making world.&quot;Love Actually&quot; stumbles happily to the semi-truth of life and love and how we cope with all the mundane crap. Love happens when we least expect it, and this film is aware of this. Love is not always fulfilled, and this film knows this sad fact as well. Thank you Mr. Curtis for at the very least attempting to reveal such important lessons.Thankfully, there's only one wedding scene in Love Actually. It's early in the film. After the bride and the groom have exchanged vows, they begin walking back down the aisle. Suddenly, a choir begins singing, trombone players stand up, someone plays a guitar and a man wails into a microphone. The bride and groom laugh in surprised delight as the impromptu musicians begin performing The Beatles' &quot;All You Need is Love.&quot;Has there ever been a more perfect song for a wedding?	4.0	I liked this valentine of a movie.....	2004-05-09	7	4	3

Yes it has a role for Hugh Grant, but if you are not a fan, don't worry, he is evenly balanced by Emma Thompson, Allan Rickman, Liam Neeson, et al. No one character steels the show.  Or monopolizes it.  My husband and I enjoy it each Holiday season because it is set at holiday time, but also because it makes us stop and think about our own personal relationships and how perhaps we could be making more time for them.  It has plenty of fun and fluff to make it a great popcorn movie while at the same time, having plenty of meat to get a hold of each time we re-watch it.  We've watched it with a number of friends and family and many of them never saw it or rented it for one reason or another (Not a fan of Hugh Grant, afraid of the British accents, not a fan of the romantic comedy) But they all reported being pleasantly surprised that it was MUCH more than the stereotype they had in their head.TAKE A CHANCE AND BUY IT: if you are on the fence, you won't be disappointed."	5.0	We watch it with friends and family EVERY Christmas season	2011-10-12	2	0	2
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3IY28PW12MSVN	Christine Wong	I loved this movie. The movie's premise was great; we were going to follow the blooming and flowering of eight different relationships in the 5 weeks before Christmas. Suffice to say, some of the movie made me cry and some made me laugh and all of it gave me a warm, tingly feeling inside.The acting is really superb and MOST of the characters interesting. The best story involves Hugh Grant as a Prime Minister who falls in love with his secretary. I admit I've been in love with Hugh Grant for ages and ages, but he is really a great comedic actor. His comic timing is impeccable. Most of the other stories were very interesting and we end up really liking the characters. However, naturally, because there are so many stories, we don't see as much of our favorite story as we'd like to. I wish we could have seen more of the stories featuring the prime minister (Hugh Grant), a couple facing a marriage crisis (Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman), a man teaching his son about love (Liam Neeson), and a man falling in love with his housekeeper (Colin Firth), probably just because their acting sucks you in. I also wish they cut three stories (porn stars, coworkers, and the British guy going to America) that, to me, were unnecessary, didn't go anywhere, and took screen time away from the better stories.But don't let that stop you from seeing the movie. The music is wonderful and you'll find yourself humming that `horrible' tune Bill Nighy sings through the movie. `Love Actually' is far from Richard Curtis's best, but a winsome British cast, a really witty script, and a shot of Hugh Grant dancing and singing down the stairs will make this movie incredibly enjoyable.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	ASZ9OMUVIGUBO	Christopher Adcock	"Apparently, this script was written in hieroglyphics by a smarmy band of illiterate Appalachian ten year olds who were at the time going through withdrawal from PCP addiction. The symbols were then coated in nacho cheese and interpreted by Dr. Phil and a team of traveling Avon saleswomen in a Native American sweathouse, where Phil sweated and chanted in a skimpy loincloth. Voila!The results are amazingly terrible. You'd think that somemone with severe ADD (myself) would enjoy a senseless montage of snuggly goodness with no developed plot or characters, but it was simply too much for my feeble, overloaded brain. When the movie started introducing a boatload of characters with seemingly unconnected lives, I braced myself for a thrilling Tarantino-esque ending that would bring it all together. Wrong! The characters don't just seem unconnected, they are! One of them is a creep who wants to make love to his best buddy's wife, and hides it by being mean. Oh, the humanity! Another is a sensitive young chimpanzee child who makes Stallone's kid in ""Over the Top"" look like someone really tough.....like Stallone. Anyways, the kid plays the drums to woo a musical genius ten year old girl who is introduced in the last five minutes. Yowza. Liam Neeson cries, his wife died. A British novelist proposes to a Portuguese scullery girl he can't talk to, she has a tattoo on the small of her back. Pow! Zap! Boom! Kablam! Two soft porn actors talk about traffic and fall in love. Hugh Grant charms as a sexed up Tony Blair with a thing for chubby ladies. In the beginning some omniscient narrator creep talks about ""The Terrorist attacks of 9/11."" These schmucks are really trying hard. Help me!!!!!! This is the romantic comedy equivalent of MTV's ""Total Request Live,"" a pleasant bombardment with useless words and images.

I have given it as a gift to my family and friends. It has many stories going on at once, yet the director manages to blend them together, so that as time pases it becomes obvious that all the characters are actually quite connected.Liam Neeson and Hugh Grant do superb jobs in their roles. Martine McCutcheon as Natalie is a delight, which adds to her popularity in England and the USA as a singer and winner of the Laurence Olivier Award. Others in the movie have long been well respected, notably Emma Thompson, Colin Firth and Laura Linney.The soundtrack is wonderfully done for each scene and each character. The movie has abit of drama, some unrequited love, and some very clever sight gags and other things which engage and entertain throughout. The movie is abit long, but time passes quickly, as it does not have any slow moments while it goes from one story sub-plot to another. Billy Bob Thorton does a very good job as an arrogant and chauvinistic US president. Thomas Sangster, as Neeson's son who recently lost his mother, does an admirable job in a part that demands both serious as well as comedic acting skills.This is truly a great movie for anyone over age sixteen or so, and especially for the adults who have been through many of the situations and problems examined in the movie in their lifetime. Throughout, it is a ""feel good movie"" that shows insight into love, fidelity, trust and the things in life that truly and ""actually"" matter. If you like this movie, you will enjoy watching it when you need cheering up, a good laugh, or watching something that points out that love, as complicated and difficult as it can be in its many forms, does indeed make the world go around."	5.0	One of the Best Romantic Comedies In The Past Ten Years	2009-04-17	2	0	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A39YOBV3KK480S	C. Lambeth	"So I don't really dig lovey-dovey movies, but this one made the cut. ""Love Actually"" is a pulp-fiction style movie that deals with how much love bites, but that sometimes, just sometimes, it all turns out ok. It's very well done and will likely leave you feeling better about love, life and relationships. If you check it out, be forewarned that it does have some nudity/ sex scenes, but probably not like you've ever seen before. The movie could have gotten along ok without them, but it's more meaningful than you might first suspect. Pornography IS the most impersonal, irreverent, pernicious form of nudity known to humanity. But this movie capitalizes on that fact by having two porn stars' most intimate, most sincere moment with each other develop with ALL of their clothes ON, on a doorstep, via an awkward chicken-peck on the cheek. It's brilliant. And if you pay extra close attention to the male character's dialog later on, you learn that he's really a virgin anyway. Absolutely brilliant.If you're a thinker and a lover (and I know you can be or wanna be) you'll dig this movie."	5.0	Worth watching (maybe even more than once); don't skip this one.	2007-08-22	3	1	2
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3HR64TBUW3AW4	Classical	"It is understood that even the greatest actors of the day must eat.  And it is also understood that they have the right to prefer extremely costly food.But I find astonishing that so many fine actors would be forced, at the same time, to compromise themselves in such an awful film, in order to keep their standards of living. Such are the hidden miseries of the high and the mighty... One can but feel sorry for the whole cast. It is great time they unionise if they don't want to have to spoil their talents in teenagers' movies.""Mary Poppins"" or "" Peter Pan"" or even "" Harry Potters"" have more poetry, and which is more important, more plausibility than ""Love actually"".And this is not because we can see a teenager rushing through the security cordons at Heathrow, to hug his girlfriend who is just boarding an airliner bound to the US.  After all even airmarshalls can't be everywhere.  More probably the filmmakers didn't want the movie to turn in a particularly bloody sequel of "" Apocalypse now"" or "" Black Hawk down"".What makes that film less plausible than ""Excalibur"" is the part starting with the American president, at 10 Downing Street, groping a girl the British Prime Minister fancies.  It is evident that this groping interlude is meant as an allegory of the ""special relationship"". And besides, groping a girl to whom they haven't been properly introduced is not absolutely unthinkable when it comes to American presidents, mind you.  Nor it is for many presidents of other Western nations.No. The clear and unacceptable impossibility is that a British Prime Minister couldn't swallow it and that this could lead him to alter dramatically the traditional British strategic alliance (unless Johnny English had been made director of MI6 AND MI5).Without that unnecessary development, ""Love actually"" would have been simply boring, instead of becoming outrageous.I advise you to get to rid of it and rather watch ""Primary colours"" (in which Emma Thompson plays a rather convincing politician's wife)."	1.0	Even the greatest actors of the day must eat	2006-09-09	24	7	17
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1EOLRV216BXJ9	Classic Movie watcher	This is such a well-written piece on romantic relationships. Its success lie in its wide appeal. I ask my friends and all have their own favorite characters and moments in the movie. I watched it 3 times and I find my favorite scenes change too. There is the writer (Colin Firth)'s proposal  to his Portugese maid. Not to forget the hilarious Hugh Grant performing his dance sequence. Keira Knightly with her secret admirer opening his heart to her at the doorstep can be overwheming. Not to mention the modern London feel throughout the movie.These wonderful short stories are so fragmented when I watched it the first time there is a longing for more. It allows me to repeat watching the movie again with nice surprises here and there. The fact that each piece is so short allows the audience to feel rather than being told the story.This is one of the few romantic classics in recent years that arouses such warm and deep feelings from a wide range of audience - young and old. An excellent combo of romantic moments that can truly stand the test of time.	5.0	Truly Romantic Classic - Less is More	2006-12-09	3	1	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2GCHG6U8HTVIT	C. O. DeRiemer	A nice movie but with enough drawbacks that I'll pass on seeing it again. I thought the episodic concept was great and kept things moving along. Bill Nighy was extraordinary and his story was great. Colin Firth's episode was touching. B. Bob Thornton had a finely honed cameo. The Hugh Grant romance was far-fetched but charming. Liam Neeson was very sympathetic. Rowan Atkinson, as usual, nearly stole the show. The romantic feel was well maintained.What keeps me from giving it a high mark? Hugh Grant's boyish charm, for me, is wearing thin. The Laura Linney episode did nothing for me, particularly since the way it ended struck me as arbitrary; The Thompson/Rickman episode just had too much of Thompsons' brave, quivering lips. She could have been more assertive and the episode would, for me, have been stronger. (But both Thompson and Rickman did great jobs with what they had to work with.) The precociousness of Neeson's &quot;son&quot; quickly got on my nerves .Very much, for the most part, a feel-good movie, but I think the director let it get away from him too many times to be really satisfying.	3.0	A Pleasing Movie...Most of the Time	2004-06-16	8	2	6

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1X4V5JSSE1ATI	Cole C	"A lot of my friends liked this movie, but I think that most of those who did were exactly those people who one would guess liked romantic comedies but who in reality dislike most such films. I don't know what that says about them or about the movie, but for my part I can say that I usually enjoy movies of this genre and thought this one was dreadful.First, there's nothing ""romantic""--nor, especially ""comic""--about adultery, which is a prevailing theme across the film's many storylines. Indeed, the dizzying volume of characters would be fine if the minor storylines (mostly cute and harmless) weren't overpowered by the repulsive and distasteful major storylines about tempted prime ministers and cheating husbands. (And of course, a wronged Emma Thompson. Don't look so shocked.)And also, much has been made of the uber-happiness of the ending, but I didn't actually find it that thrilling--the various storylines collude in a way that is neither interesting nor useful at adding any substance to the ""plot,"" and the sheer bluntness of it all makes you feel more like someone screamed ""Be Happy!"" rudely in your face than that you have actually enjoyed yourself.If you're a romantic comedy person, you'll probably see this film at some point or another regardless--it certainly has its fans. I just hope that you don't end up being one of them."	1.0	Others liked it, but I'm not sure why	2004-09-15	31	10	21
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	ABMYCFVNH18EM	Cole the Younger	Because of the gifted cast and director, I had high hopes for a pleasantly distracting evening with this film--alas, twas not to be.  I'm not sure if Curtis was A) cynically going for profit and the Ulitimate Cheese Factor, B) making an over-the-top parody of himself and/or modern romances, or C) really has an infantile view of adult relationships, but this movie simply didn't work for me or my wife (and we normally love the type of film the reviewers touted this to be).The characters were nearly all stereotyped caricatures of a thirteen-year-old's idea of adults.  The mini-story presented by Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman was the best by far, and the film would have been much better if this were the central plot, dispensing with much of the rest.  All of these actors are so much better than the crudely drawn and simplistic people Curtis has them portraying, and many (especially Hugh Grant) seem to be merely playing satirical versions of the roles that made them &quot;famous&quot; rather than making serious attempts to give depth to the roles.Still, I can't fault the acting, really.  The cast seems to have made the best of the material given them--the flaw of the film is the insultingly juvenile script, abetted by some surprisingly amateurish (or ineptly manipulative) direction on the part of Curtis.Sorry for the negative review, but I hope to warn viewers expecting an entertaining, mature film with some depth to it.  Although there are a few good scenes, overall this film is superficial and false, filled with incredibly unrealistic actions and dialog, never allowing me to suspend disbelief for more than a minute or two at a time.	2.0	Disappointment Abounds	2004-06-04	18	11	7

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3SFO2GSP5CVSM	"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom"""	The start and end of the film takes place at Heathrow, where a montage of people being greeted by their loved ones is lent poignancy by the opening narration of Hugh Grant stating that all the known messages left by the people who died on the 9/11 airplanes were messages of love and not hate, and the closing song of the Beach Boys' God Only Knows. Also effective is the use of cameos in the film, most notably as dream babes such as Claudia Schiffer, Denise Richards, and Shannon Elizabeth make brief appearances in the airport as love interests for some of the diverse characters, who we see now have known each other in casual ways, each with different takes on love.Is Love Actually a film that will challenge you the way 2001: A Space Odyssey does?

Daniel's step-son is having problems though. He is in love with a girl at school who he thinks does not even know he is alive. He and Daniel come up with a plan that gets her to notice him at the end though.There is also Jamie, played by Colin Firth whose wife cheated on him so he goes to France to write a book. He falls in love with a maid at his cottage that is Portuguese and goes back to London to learn Portuguese so he can ask her to marry him.There is also Colin who strikes out a lot in London and thinks that he needs to go to the U.S. to get laid. His friend tries to dissuade him from going, but Colin eventually goes to Wisconsin where he meets several woman.Colin's friend is a producer who is making a porno movie and the two stand ins for the main characters fall in love while doing the things needed for the movie.There is also Juliet played by Kiera Knightly who finds out that her husband's best friend has a crush on her.There is also a character named Bill. He is a former singer who wants to have a comeback so he performs a Christmas version of Love is all Around that sucks, but makes it to number one.And last, but not least there is Sarah played by Laura Linney. She works in the office of Karen's husband who is in love with a man named Karl who works with her. On the night of the office Christmas party they get together, but there is one complication- her brother. He is mentally ill and calls all the time, he even calls her right before Sarah and Karl get together which stops them in their tracks.All in all a very funny, poignant look at several lives at Christmas	5.0	Very interesting-can be confusing	2004-11-15	0	0	0

I write it to the Americans out there who will read this; you who have made some of the finest films in history. I must ask you not to be taken in by this ghastly nonsense. There is nothing remotely new in this film than that which you will have seen in any romantic comedy that has gone before. More importantly though - THIS IS NOT ENGLAND. LONDON IS NOT LIKE THIS. WE ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY THIS AWFUL FILM. London's population is highly cosmopolitan and diverse. There are many coloured people in this city, and we are not all middle class and white. This film is the hiatus of Richard Curtis land - a place where it often snows, everything turns out well, everyone makes jokes, and there is not a black/asian face to be seen. This land is not ours; it is embedded in the mind of Curtis.The simple notion that love conquers all and will sooth us is mundane to the point of death. Love causes an awful lot of problems as well. Terrorists love their ethos, faith, and lands so much that they commit terror...Not forgetting that oaf Billy Bob Thornton's representation of your own president. Would have been nice to see a reasonable interpretation of your country's leader. You've had Lincoln, Wilson, Roosevelt, Truman - lets forget the present for now, ok. Now you've got Billy Bob (how did gorgeous Angeline Jolie ever see anything in this average-looking idiot).Please turn away from this for your own sakes.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2L0ZCGUICHX7U	C. P. Gibbs	"Nearly half the vignettes presented in this ensemble film are utter trash....forced, phony, unrealistic and difficult to watch. The rest are varying degrees of charming and good. Emma Thompson deserves mention for a really good, really heartwrenching piece of acting...but she never seems like she is acting. Liam Neeson is wasted on a piece of trash involving his stepson....who does not talk or act like a child his age: It is so irritating when movies portray a child as a small, cute adult. This one is particularly uncharming and involves a borderline-icky crush on a waaaayyy too mature singing star 10-year-old girl. Weird and almost creepy. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are graceful, dashing charming actors who have made a great living out of playing charming, dashing bumblers. They do a great job in their lovely respective stories. But by far the worst and best are as follows: The vignette featuring the couple who is newly married and the best friend with the unrequited crush on the bride is PAINFULLY BAD. The actress playing the bride is unbearably forced and SO irritating. Her would-be love is Casper Milquetoast who is clearly besotted with her looks. ""You are perfect"" he says. Oh Yuck. The very best is the aging rock star making a really sad comeback, but he plays it as a hilarious good time. If the whole movie were about him, it would have been GREAT. He was STELLAR.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3VDGERHHLOQVQ	Crabby Apple Mick Lee	"Love Actually is a anthology of several stories into one movie.  In theory, any one of them could have been developed into a film by itself; but the entertainment is in the switching back and forth between plotlines.All these stories come together on Christmas Eve in expected and some unexpected ways at the end of the film.  Some are not charmed by this ""cut and paste"" of storylines into one film.  They complain that none of the individual plots holds much interest for a movie by themselves and do not work when all jumbled together.  But they miss the point.  It is not meant to be taken seriously.  All these plots are played for humor and bits of sentimental warmth.  As a whole Love Actually makes for fun and enchanting movie watching.American viewers may have been turned away from ""Love Actually"" because this is a very English movie.  Aside from a few pokes at Americans and the jarring outburst against American foreign policy, a little forbearing toward the cultural divide pays off greatly.  None of the English accents are difficult to follow as some English films in the past have been.  The rather liberal use of the ""f***"" word and nudity may mean you don't invite Grandma and Grandpa over for family movie night.  But Love Actually is well worth the purchase and repeated viewings."	4.0	CHRISTMAS CONFESSIONS INSIDE	2004-05-05	0	0	0

Richard Curtis, Hugh Grant et al. contributed their talents to Four Weddings and A Funeral, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones. I own and rewatch all of those movies.Love Actually did not disappoint. Think Robert Altman meets Four Weddings and a Funeral. Several sweet, bittersweet, and downright painful relationships unfold during the movie. In one way or another, one story ends up being linked to another which is linked to another...A synopsis of the stories...Hugh Grant is the new, dashing British Prime Minister who has fallen in love with his tea lady...the tea lady lives next door to a lusty young minx who is throwing herself at  her boss Alan Rickman...Rickman is intrigued but perplexed as he has been married for years to Emma Thompson (Hugh Grant's sister in the movie)...Thompson meanwhile is comforting her best friend, Liam Nesson, who has recently been widowed...Neeson is helping his 10-year old stepson deal with a crush...and so on. Somewhere in there Colin Firth shows up as a novelist in love with his Portuguese maid and two shy stand-ins to a porn movie meet and fall in love...and there is a hilarious scene stealing performance of a singer named ""Billy Mack"" who wants his worst ever Christmas song to make #1.Curtis' point: Love is all around us and you just need to open your eyes to see it. But it's not all idyllic romantic love in this movie: you'll see platonic love, dying love, unrequited love and so on.Anyway it's a great Christmas movie-adults only-and I highly recommend it."	4.0	Loved It!

The direction was normal, but the acting and the script were well done.  Very refreshing to see an adult movie that doesn't rely on special effects to carry the story, because, here, the story carries itself.I noticed that many reviews complained about the nude scenes.  I guess that's why it's often referred to as an ""adult"" movie. I had no problem with them---after all, it comes with the subject matter. The ""negative effects of love"", as one reviewer called it, are part of life. Not everyone's mind you, but they are out there. Ignoring that or covering it up are not going to change that.

One: it would be just as good as i thought it would be, if not better.  Two: it...just...wouldn't.  haha Well, thankfully, my first hope was fulfilled.  ""Love Actually"" is grand...need I say more?But I will.The movie--soo good, wildly entertaining, extremely funny, heart-warming, and charming...very romantic...i fell in love with a certain handsome character (Rodrigo Santoro who plays Karl)...mama mia!!! ;-)  hehehe. When I went to the first showing at the box office, the lady behind me asked me what the movie was all about.  I only had to say but two words, and she was convinced.  Is that not cool, or what?  ;-)i recommend this movie immensely! it is so funny...(one of my favorite parts is the spectacle of Hugh Grant dancing about and through his house...too, too adorable. :o)  his moves...man oh man...maybe one of the best dance sequences I have ever scene...I mean, what is better than spontaneity when it comes to groovin'?  not much.  hehe Hugh Grant...boy, an incredibly talented actor, especially when it comes to humor, not to mention he could charm the boots off of anyone. :o) ) I also loved it when Liam Neeson had that ""serious"" talk with his stepson Sam, who he thought was having trouble dealing with his mother's death when ""actually"" his depressed mood was due to his passionate and painful unrequited love for a slightly older America pop star.  The eight or nine-year-old boy was so serious when he told Daniel (Neeson) that he wasn't too young to be in love...that, too, is so incredibly cute. =)This movie will have you laughing at every point of the film. ok, well except for the really touching, tender moments like when Laura Linney goes to visit her brother in a pyschiatric hospital--her brother, who during Laura's last visit tries to strike her, but this time throws his manly arms around her and hugs her tightly--is the forgiving spirit of Christmas at work here?  maybe...you could go ahead and infer that. This random act of love may bring tears to your eyes, but of course some might be a little irked that in order for her to tend to her brother she had to forfeit her newly-begun relationship with the really tall, dark, and handsome Brazilian Rodrigo Santoro.  tut tut tut.  What a shame...they never did bring complete closure to what went on between the two.  That's maybe the one thing I disliked about the film.  the ONE.  haha...in other words, everything else was wonderful. heheAnd then there's the really sweet, romantic aspects of the film that will bring some, like my friend Kim, literally to tears. Who knows? Some people cry at weddings. Others, like me, cry at funerals. Who knows why really...who knows why.....the characters are just too hilarious, too sweet, and too cute or cool or just so undeniably hot that you can't NOT like 'em. u kno whadda i mean? they're jus lovable characters, and you and your subconscious suddenly find yourselves relating to them because you or someone you know has been in the same or a very similar predicament as the characters brought to life on screen. The presence of Christmas was never overlooked. =) Well, ok, maybe that is truly obvious because the holdiay was the underlying theme of ""Love Actually"", but all shrewdness aside, the warm, fuzzy spirit gets you in such a way that you feel like leaping out of your seat, jumping up into the screen, and hugging every single person in the movie.  Hmmm...seriously now, what more can I ask for in a movie? A brilliant cast, a story set in the most celebrated, highly favored holiday of the year...the stars speaking in the most beloved accent of them all (English)...handsome, but humble men (who really don't take themselves too seriously), pretty but adorable ladies (ladies who seem to forget just how lovely they really are) and the cutest boy (Sam played by Thomas Sangster) you have ever laid eyes upon; and I mean, EVER. :DLove Actually has it all. And the great part about it is, it's not just exclusive romantic love that is celebrated.  You have several forms....maybe even the most essential kinds--the love of a family, the love between a mother and daughter, stepfather and son, friend and friend, but most of all, the love of a community...a community joined for a single purpose: to present to the world a love that consumes and touches all.I wanted to see ""Elf"" this past Friday, too, but since it was already late in the evening, I only had time to see one, so of course, I, being the Christamas-loving, romance fanatic that I am, chose the movie that has those similar aspects of humor and Christmas as I am sure is seen in ""Elf"", but with that added, much endorsed instance of love's beauty.  Love is actually the greatest thing on earth, and ""Love Actually"", well...attempts to show the most dear and great things about it. I must say, the makers of ""Notting Hill"" and ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" succeeded in doing just that. (pip pip! cheers!!)So throw away your cynicism and lame opposition to anything and everything that has to do with the entirely human emotion of love, and do yourself and every other cynic out there a favor...just see the movie!!  You won't regret it.  =)(no pressure of course =P )"	5.0	"""Love Actually"" is grand, actually."	2003-11-11	3	2	1

Bill Nighy comes to mind right off bat as a real reason to watch this film, for his portrayal of Billy Mack, the washed up rock star vying for a second chance is just utterly hysterical.As love triangles are formed, new love blossoms and lasting love begins to fade, a cast that includes Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightly, Hugh Grant, Martine McCutcheon, Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman deliver laughs and smiles that are sure to please the viewer.Some of the characters and relationships could have been axed to provide stronger storylines for key characters, but all in all this is a great slice of entertainment and not a bad way to spend some time.	4.0	Great `adult' holiday comedy.	2006-12-07	3	1	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3CX9ZSEFCDXX4	Daniel Hurley	"This is a unique film that is actually a series of stories about relationships. Most are about individuals starting new relationships with a variety of others such as one ending due to death, one struggling marriage, one rebounding from a broken relationship, two shy stand ins makinga film , a young man frantically searching for a physical relationship, a man in love with his best friend's girl, and a mad mature scene stealing rocker who inserts great humor during his seemingly destructive marketing of his rerecording of a former hit as a Christmas song. All the stories are in fractured bits as the movie leaps from one story to another, each one probably has 20 minutes of actual film time that you seem to see in two to four minute bursts, which seem to get longer as each reach their climax at the end. There are three sad stories, two of which seem to rebound but the saddest is a young woman played by Laura Linney who takes tremendous responsibility for her mental health impaired brother while pursuing a handsome yet seemingly socially limited co-worker who cannot contemplate her dedication for her dependent brother. There is a lot of humor interspersed throughout and my favorite story was Hugh Grant playing the Prime Minister trying to refuse the sweet and innocent but earthy charms of a lovely big boned assistant played wonderfully by Martine McCutcheon. The PM story takes a zing at America by posing the President as a creepy, dominating womanizer but since Billy Bob Thornton played it rather creepily, you don't empathize with the character. My favorite single character is the ex-bad boy rocker Billy Mack played very believably by Bill Nighy. His outrageous attempts to promote his song, while also insulting it, and making flippant remarks such as, ""Kids don't buy drugs.........wait until you are a rock star and they will give them to you for free!"" are delightfully fun breaks from the other stories.  On the most part, the stories end happily with only one that totally crashes so it is a mostly upbeat entertaining film. The number of great actors playing in this film is stunning, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth (with an amazing proposal) Liam Nielsen, beautiful Keira Knightly (hard to believe she was the tom boy in ""Bend it Like Beckham) and Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) in two wonderful cameo roles as a dry incredulously proper and proficient jewelry salesman (""In the flashest of flash""). Interspersed throughout is a great soundtrack with hits from the Pointer sisters, Nora Jones, Kelly Clarkson (soulful), Maroon 5, Otis Redding, Olivia Olson (""All I want for Christmas"" is outstanding and she is 10?), Lynden David Hall (fantastic version of ""All You Need is Love""), Beach Boys (""God Only Knows"", which seems perfect for the ending showcasing those that end on a positive note) and the Billy Mack song ""Christmas is all Around"" is a hoot and is actually very entertaining and catchy although its played up as a bit of a farce. Virtually a good romantic comedy interspersed with some touching, sad and real stories but overall leaves you with hope for the few that end with a struggle and happiness for those that make it."	5.0	A  Series of Romantic Stories: Humorous, Fun and Sad	2004-12-31	9	5	4
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2P49WD75WHAG5	Daniel J. Hamlow	"Just the tonic needed during my fall break from college.  This movie is not only British, has Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson, but was directed by Ben Curtis, who wrote Four Weddings and Notting Hill.  Love Actually begins with a voiceover by Hugh Grant affirming that if anyone needs evidence of love, take a look at the airports of people being reunited with their friends, family, etc.  He even says that when the twin towers fell, the last phone calls to the families from the victims were surely those of love.The story examines the stories of many many people here.  First off, there is the newly elected prime minister, (Hugh Grant, who else?) who's unmarried and soon starts falling for Natalie, his pretty assistant who's self-conscious about her weight, although it's not so apparent here.  It's his feelings towards her that later leads him to face down the U.S. president.  He says that the UK may be smaller than the US, but it's still a great country, the country of Shakespeare, The Beatles, and Harry Potter.  The bits with the PM are the best, as his personality is seen more in the romantic and comical scenes.  Marine McCutcheon plays Natalie as a lovable character with a cute accent and voice, and is one of the brighter stars here.The PM$B!G(Bs sister Karen is married to Harry, the head of a designs firm who's gained the flirtateous eye of his secretary Mia.  He's also got Sarah, an employee who is in love with another employee, Carl, but both are too shy to admit it.  Harry encourages Sarah to take the plunge.Then there's Daniel (Liam Neeson), who's recently lost his wife Joanna and has the difficult task of looking after his stepson Sam.  He can't stay sad for long, as Sam has fallen in love with an American girl in his class, a girl named Joanna, yes, like the mother/wife, who's pretty but doesn't know he exists.  Trying to figure out how to get the two together bonds stepfather and son together.The funniest involves Billy Mack, an outrageous but cynical, craggy-faced mid-fifties rock star who speaks his mind and trying to make a comeback by doing a Christmas remake of the Troggs' ""Love Is All Around,"" which was done in another Curtis-penned film by Wet Wet Wet, Four Weddings.  He's facing competition from a new generation, a boy band Blue, for the hallowed Christmas #1 single and even promises to sing it naked if he wins.  His remarks cause no end of consternation to his overweight, long-suffering, but faithful manager.  Example: $B!H(BKids, this is a message from your Uncle Billy. Don't buy drugs. Wait until you're a rock star, and they give them to you for free!$B!I(B  And his music video bears a strong resemblance to Robert Palmer$B!G(Bs $B!H(BAddicted To Love.$B!I(BJamie, nursing wounds of a bad relationship, goes to France to write a novel, and rents a lakeside cabin typing a novel.  He takes in Aurelia, a Portuguese woman who acts as his maid.The most outrageous is that of Colin, a red-haired guy with a manic look about him who thinks the only way to score is to go to America and hook up with some chicks.  His black friend thinks he's crackers.Love Actually has a smidgin of the Happenstance formula in it--where many disparate people in the story come together or turn out to know someone else in the movie.  And just when one thinks things can$B!G(Bt get any better, Rowan Atkinson, Shannon Elizabeth, and Denise Richards appear!  But the songs that appear, such as Norah Jones$B!G(B $B!H(BTurn Me On$B!I(B, Eva Cassidy$B!G(Bs lovely cover of Fleetwood Mac$B!G(Bs $B!H(BSongbird$B!I(B, and in a funny moment, the Pointer Sisters $B!H(BJump For My Love$B!I(B also enhance this movie.A nice romantic story/Christmas movie rolled into one, Ben Curtis does it yet again, as his stories constantly evolve, from Four Weddings, Notting Hill, and now this.  The overall theme seems to be from the song from the beginning, $B!H(BLove Is All Around,$B!I(B whoever you're with or whoever special person will appear in your life."	5.0	Love is all around, once again, actually	2003-11-24	34	15	19

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2GYX971VETQBV	Daniel R. Sanderman	I will be the first to admit that I don't really like romantic comedies all that much.  They tug at our heart strings, make us sick to our stomachs, and leave us dripping in sacharine sweetness.  LOVE ACTUALLY is no exception to the mix.  In fact, this film seems to be a romantic comedy on steroids, combining the Hollywood happiness of several movies into a single extravaganza.  Throughout the film, we are treated to many interweaving storylines of love.Although I found the film to be a bit too sweet for my tooth, I did enjoy watching the storylines overlap one another and I was entertained.  Despite the film's length, I found myself interested in a couple of the storylines in particular..like that  of Billy Mack, a cynical rock star who steals every scene he is in.LOVE ACTUALLY is neither a great film nor a terrible one.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1HX00DL0SZM1G	"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer"""	"I watched `Love Actually' with an eclectic group of friends last Friday night. And even though we all thought that the movie (which traces the seemingly separate love stories of several couples - and some love triangles) didn't quite gel together we all agreed that it was a true ""feel good"" picture and overall an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.With a simply incredible cast that toplines a number of the major British actors (Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley) the movie does occasionally seem unwieldy and top heavy. But the most common effect throughout the group of us who sat through it last week was smiles as the simple charm of the picture wins you over.This is a hard picture to give a brief synopsis of the plot for. There is so much going on and a lot of which appears unrelated that all one can say is the film tries to convince us that love is everywhere. We have a newly elected single British Prime Minister (Hugh Grant). An author taking a working holiday in France (Colin Firth). A young bride (Keira Knightley) whose best man comes to realize he also loves (who can blame him) and a young boy who loves an American girl who is returning to the USA and a number of other stories. Stories that all come to a satisfying conclusion by the time the end credits roll.Another notable highlight of the movie is the soundtrack and as our group tried to figure out what the connection was between all people in this movie we all decided that regardless of how well it turned out - the soundtrack was a winner. With its selection of favorites one of the group exclaimed `I think this movie has all my favorite in it.'So, if you feel like getting into one of the best `feel good' movies of the past year (or any year) or simply want to watch an all-star cast at the top of their game then `Love Actually' needs to be on your list. It's a good reminder that entertainment comes in many different forms  - just like love."	4.0	Just like love...actually	2004-11-15	5	5	0
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A27FR2C67JPDRS	Daryl B	I missed this movie at the theater and have been waiting for its dvd release with considerable anticipation.  I'm happy to say that the wait was worth it.  This film has a great cast of actors including Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Lian Neeson, Laura Linney and Hugh Grant---whose characters are all dealing with different levels of love and relationships.  There is Emma's character dealing with her husband being unfaitful;  Liam's character dealing with the death of his wife and his endearing relationship with his stepson; Hugh Grant's priminister falling for a young lady from the wrong side of the tracks; and Colin Firth's character dealing with love and the barrier of two languages.  The director seams the stories together nicely and leaves the audience with a renewed faith in love and a realization that love comes in many forms---love for a sibling, love for a stepchild and, of course, romantic love.  Not every story in this film has a perfect ending but the overall effect is that love is all around us.  In a time when we seem to focus on the hatred and wars of the world, this little film gives a small sample of what we all need--love!	5.0	Lovely, actually!	2004-04-28	2	1	1

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2VKJOBZEZJ2A0	David A. Bede	"If you've only seen ""Love Actually"" once or twice, you really haven't seen it - at least not all of it.  Probably no movie is more worthy of repeated viewings.  It's not that there's much of anything subtle about this saccharine but great collection of love stories.  Far from it.  It's just that there are so many stories being told at one time that keeping them all straight is tricky the first couple of times you see them unfold.So is keeping track of all the major characters - there are nearly twenty of them - but you do get to know them all surprisingly well after a few viewings.  Some are better developed than others, but the cast is great with what they have to work with.  If you're hoping for a happy ending, there are entirely too many of those and many of them are too happy - but hey, it is a Christmas movie, after all.  The few sad endings are also mostly well done.No matter how many times you've seen the movie, the deleted scenes are a nice addition.  A lot of the weaker points of the story are fleshed out a bit more, and we even see a few plot twists that ended up being abandoned.  (Apparently the running time would have been well over three hours if they had all been included!)  The commentary is also terrific, probably the best I've heard on any DVD.  Besides lots of interesting trivia on the evolution of the movie (Why the token American character?  Where did they get that great airport footage?), they also reveal an intended ending that was apparently abandoned early on and never even filmed.  You'll never guess it, but you'll probably like it if you like the movie in general.Happy Christmas, luv!"	5.0	You won't shoot your eye out, but you may need some insulin!	2006-09-17	1	0	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY	"David A. Dein ""passafist"""	"That is the spirit in which I can approach a film like Richard Curtis's LOVE ACTUALLY.  It is so close to being my favorite romantic comedy I almost wished that my own stupid sense of right and wrong didn't mess it up for me.  This is a movie that's so good that it's flaws are doubly illuminated.Love is everywhere or at least that's the premise that Hugh Grant's (About a Boy) opening narration claims.  Then the movie goes on to prove just that.  We watch as 10 or 15 delightful and charming people fall in love.  And in the end each of these people is also connected either directly or indirectly to the other characters in the movie and so in the end LOVE ACTUALLY is a small microcosm of British society.The film has charming written all over it.  Hugh Grant again plays that charming and debonair lady-killer he's gotten so good at playing.  Colin Firth (Bridget Jones's Dairy) plays this charming writer who falls for his maid, who doesn't speak English.  Emma Thompson (Junior) plays a mother and wife trying to come to grips with a tragedy in her own mind.  Liam Neeson (Schindler's List) play a widower who's young son has fallen ""desperately"" in love.  And While all this is going on, Alan Rickman (Dogma) and Laura Linney falls people in their office and Keira Knightly (Bend It Like Beckham) marries the man of her dreams, only to discover a little secret about his best friend.  As you can see a lot is going on here.  I can best be described as if you took a hundred romantic comedies and jammed them together.  Kind of a silly and romantic version of Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS.Thankfully most of the major characters are fun, charming, and bring their own little piece of life to the film.  There is scene after scene of inventive fun.  I also liked how the film was full of silly cameo's that didn't destroy the overall structure.  Sure I saw Billy Bob Thorton, but the film didn't try to jam him down my throat.  I found my self momentarily going there's Billy Bob, but he embodies his character (The US President, think George W. Bush with Clinton's Libido), he's not playing Billy Bob.The most interesting story arc follows Grant and his secretary (Martine McCutcheon, TV's Eastenders).  It's pitch perfect.  Every scene of him and McCutcheon made me smile.  I wanted to the see the outcome. I truly wanted these two people to fall in love.  It's hard for me to want to think that about characters in a more vapid rom-com.It's scenes and characters like Grant and McCutcheon that make the weaker moments of the film fail miserably.  Most notably the stupid segments involving the stand-in's on the porno movie set and the dumb scenes involving the annoying British boy who goes to Wisconsin.  I wanted to watch characters that were involving.  These two story arcs were built on cartoon premises.  They're both weaker, like two bad jokes in an utterly flawless comedy routine.  They were both to silly, and did not have enough development to warrant their inclusion in this film.The film also suffers from an overload of characters.  With so many interesting people to follow, it was difficult to dwell on one set of characters.  In the end you wind up getting the Cliff's Notes view of all these people. This hurts the Laura Linney (Maze) story most notably, because Curtis's screenplay tries to introduce dramatic scenes that are barely touched upon.  This makes at least one heart-wrenching scene in a mental hospital feel a little out of place.  Like it was tacked on cause every comedy needs a dramatic moment.I also hated that the screenplay glossed over much of the Rickman's characters humanity.  Leaving the final outcome of his story arc vague, cause god forbid we leave the movie hating one of the main characters.  If you're going to waste time creating tension only to keep us in the dark in the end don't waste my time.In the end LOVE ACTUALLY is a wholly frustrating and equally a great film.  It's chock full of funny characters, silly romance, tragic stories, and in the end it delivers a movie that is mostly worth watching.I would also be remiss if I didn't mention Bill Nighy's (Underworld) wonderfully silly Billy Mack, a character that is really funny if a tad bit unnecessary. He plays an aging rock musician who's re-written one of his classic tunes into a Christmas song.  Sure he's sold out, but he sure won't promote it as if he did.  If Oscar has a funny bone, this performance is worth a supporting actor nomination.Listen if you can shut out the flaws, LOVE ACTUALLY will leave you satisfied.  If you're like me, then you like the movie with maybe a few too many reservations.  LOVE ACUTALLY is the best romantic comedy I've seen in a long time, and one of the best (if frustrating) movies of the year.****1/2 (out of 5)"	4.0	The Best (If Most Frustrating)Romantic Comedy of All Time	2003-11-07	7	5	2
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A20CB0XXWS57J9	David A. Riley	What a great feel good movie from the people who produced Notting Hill and Bridget Jones.  The cast may not be so well known in the US but they are really good, Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth and Liam Neeson to name just a few.Some of the scenarios are a little wierd like the couple of reserved tongue tied body doubles who spend all day in the nude together simulating sex and a single British Prime Minister (doesn't happen).  All together the film covers eight couples in the throws of finding love, which keeps the movie interesting and fresh paced.The genius of the film is in the way the little agonies and ecstacies of love are portrayed, which is so real it takes you beyond any feeling of contrivance in the story lines.  You can see yourself and feel agonies of old come back to haunt you as this movie unfolds.  The missed chance, the verbal stumblng, blowing the main chance by doing too much or worse doing too little or nothing.  This is not the human condition type of great soul searing agony, in this movie everything you see happens every day in every country and at sometime in our lives to all of us.Within the overall feel good factor there are some really good performances, Neesom dealing with the death of his wife and bonding with his step son in particular stands out in the memory.The feel good comes from the fact that everyone, or nearly everyone gets their woman or man.  The same sadly can not be said for reality, but watching the movie you conveniently forget and feel great.	5.0	Multiple Love Actually	2004-04-27	5	5	0

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3EEBE82C3HYRD	David	"My favorite romantic comedy. It's kind of odd, but no matter your thoughts of the emotion love, somewhere in this movie it will relate to it. This is because it isn't just one story but instead a bunch of short stories compressed into one movie.I typically hate movies like this, where there is interconnectedness among the characters/stories. Often that is because it is overdone or stretched to work (I actually wasn't a fan of Crash for this reason). This movie the characters and stories connect enough that it is pleasant but there isn't too much overlap that the storyline had to be fudged to make it work. The characters were allowed the freedom to feel real and the acting was good enough that, even though no one was on screen too long, a connection with the characters is made.Of the characters, they are very entertaining and quite fun. The old rock'n'roller ""searching for a comeback at any price."" The Prime Minister who finds himself attracted to one of the workers in his home. The best man (of a wedding) who takes issue with his friend's new bride. The characters go on...At the price Amazon is offering this movie at, I would say buy it; if you rent it, you've already paid 1/3 to 1/2 of the price and I would bet you will want to buy it after renting it anyways. At the very least, make sure you watch this movie at some point... preferably around Christmas time. I'm not a huge Christmas person but this movie lifts my spirits, even when it isn't the holiday season."	5.0	Balanced Romantic Comedy	2006-07-31	3	2	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A103KNDW8GN92L	David Hugaert	"Christmastime in London - shoppers milling about, cool, crisp winter breezes, with mistletoe and a good dose of holiday cheer enough to fill many a stocking. Add to this bastion of sweet Christmas goodies, four various scenarios involving people of different professions, all of whom juggling both home and family with a roundabout love life. This makes for an interesting combination of a full-blown soap opera, combined with the wit and wisdom of an intellectual novel. Piece the entire puzzle together, and you have a well written, directed and produced motion picture that is ""Love Actually"". Hugh Grant is ""The Prime Minister"" - a sort of chap trying to keep a small nation afloat, while attempting to keep his love life at bay as well. ""LA""'s other leading man, Colin Firth, is also trying to balance out his life, and falls for a Portugese woman (who doesn't speak English) along his tumultuous journey. Bill Nighy plays a pompous, arrogant middle-aged rock star named Billy Mack, who has everything and wants even more (more people of the female persuasion, that is). Donald Sutherland look and sound alike actor Alan Rickman nearly steals the show here, as his portrayal of a book author will turn many a head, thus making the critics really sit up and take notice. The actors aren't the only attraction here. The contrasting architectural backdrops of ""old and new"" London blend in perfectly with the film's storyline. When looking for a romantic setting, one can't find a more romantic city than London to center a story around. Of ""Love Actually""'s funnier moments, the prize for comedic excellence would most likely go to Bill Nighy for his portrayal of a flashy, overbearing and conceited rock star. This guy gets the funniest lines in the entire movie, even stealing a scene (or two) from Mr. Grant! Another priceless and hilarious moment, is when ""The Prime Minister"" and his limo driver are singing ""Good King Wenceslas"" (as ""mock carolers"") to a group of children! Alas, there are many more priceless and funny moments from where these came. Great supporting roles are also supplied by Keira Knightley (as one of the daughters) and from Rowan Atkinson (as a department store clerk), among others. With so much to offer, ""Love Actually"" is sure to be in the running for ""Best Picture of 2003"" honors, as well as being a major box office draw this holiday season. So, whether you're bitten by the love bug or not, you ""Actually"" don't want to miss all the ""Love"" that's destined to come your way at your local venue today!"	4.0	Actually...This is a very good movie!	2003-11-17	5	2	3

I so hated this movie that I tried to get my money back and even argued for a refund on my box of goobers. No one likes a British comedy more than me. The Full Monty, Billy Elliott,About a boy, even Calendar Girls would be better than this drivel. It was a who's who of today's best British actors but even they seemed embarrassed to be there and only showed up in body. They left their talent at home. I'm not pointing fingers but someone called in some favors..the writer?..the director? Who knows. Not enough to discourage you? OK, here's some more...Under-developed characters with as much personality as a box of hair. Completely, unbelievable plot lines. Too many plot lines to follow without a pen and notebook. Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister of England..come on. Oh, and Americans come off very badly in this film. Our President is a big, bully chewing on hayseed while grabbing innocent English women on their bottoms. All the while bullying England into doing his bidding. A nose-picking, burping, illiterate jerk of an Englishman goes to America because there he can get dates. American women(giggling half-wits) will do anything(including him) once they hear that English accent. What else, too PC, too boring, too long, too stupid, just too much.

"One of the movies I like to watch over and over and over again, Love Actually delivers the perfect balance of Hollywood sap and reality. This movie features multiple stories, mostly overlapping each other somehow.This isn't one of those movies with a typical storyline of boy meets girl, falls in love, etc etc. It contains different kinds of love: love between friends, love between parent and child, love between brother and sister, etc.The all-star cast is phenomenal. And the music is just fanastic. (Note: the use of ""Both Sides Now"" by Joni Mitchell in one specific scene is sure to bring tears to your eyes.)Of course, this movie contains the infamous ""To me, you're perfect."" scene, a moment which every girl dreams of... just not from someone they don't actually love.I don't know anyone who has seen it and not loved it to bits.It may be just another romantic comedy, but this film speaks to the heart and allows viewers to really appreciate all the people they have in their lives.In the end, you will truly realize that love, actually, is all around."	5.0	Best Romantic Comedy of All Time	2008-02-07	4	1	3

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A121LU1P40URV	"Deborah Terrill ""DebbieT"""	Like other reviewers, there were parts of this movie I absolutely loved.  But like the Christmas cookie plate, there were just too many sweet choices, and I was left at the end of the film with a tummy-ache.  This could have been a lovely family film (or at least one I could take my mother to), EXCEPT for a plot line about a couple who meet while filming a porno movie.  Ok, it was humorous at times, as they carried on regular conversion while in the most provacative of poses.  But the story is a minor one, doesn't advance the plot or message, and makes it impossible for anyone to take their teen children to. Which is too bad, because there is a poignant story about a middle-school age boy who has a crush on the most popular girl at school.  At any rate, I still liked it, especially since I had Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, and Alan Rickman, all in one movie!!  Hugh Grant is looking even better these days, with a few wrinkles on his face.  Colin Firth turns in a lovely performance as a bumbling writer.  Alan Rickman is a potentially unfaithful husband, and I don't know if it was writing or directing, but something was missing with it.  Nevertheless, just listening to his wonderful, resonant voice is worth the price of admission.  Go see this one with your girl-buddies, but not your mom.	4.0	Heart-warming, but...	2003-12-05	5	4	1

It has many nice moments, but ultimately it suffers from trying to follow too many plot lines.  You only get brief glimspes into any one of these stories so that it is hard to get too emotionally invested in any one of them.  The film is packed with talented actors, but few of them get to really show off that talent because they have so little to work with. So while it was a nice movie, I felt at the end that it could have been so much better if it had been pared down to following about half of the characters, particularly Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and his son, and Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman.

This is another masterpiece by the author of the most celebrated British comedies (4 Weddings, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones).The movie is driven by as many as 6 different stories going on simultaneously, switching from one into the next.  The viewer is left with anticipation of all the other stories while he enjoys the current story being told; it is one of those movies that leaves us waiting at the end for a little more.Another highlight of the movie is the cast; there are many stars, each of which figure in one of the little plots.  Some of it converges in the end, but the main theme of love is present throughout.  The stories range from a lovesick prime minister (Hugh Grant), to an angry cheated wife (Emma Thompson), to an English writer with a Portuguese maid with whom he cannot communicate.If you liked the other british comedies mentioned, you will love this one.  If you dislike happy endings, stir away from this movie; I have never seen this many.	5.0	BEST ROMANTIC COMEDY OF 2003	2003-12-27	4	2	2

Yes, there is nudity and the nudity is related ""distantly"" to sex but those scenes are superfluous to the movie. What you're essentially seeing is the naked body, nothing to be ashamed of, right? Would the previous reviewers refuse to see Michelangelo's great works of art? Or so many other great masters who painted nudes? No one dares call those ""pornographic."" It is so obvious that the two actors who portray naked stand-in actors are NOT naked to each other. If that's all you see, you've missed the point of the whole movie.Politics between the USA and the UK? Forget it.

This is a great British ensemble with the qualities of acting you can expect. However, the writing of plot and dialogue left a lot to be desired. It seemed that the writers tried to be as witty as the writers of 'FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL' with the complicated plot of 'GOSFORD PARK' and they failed because they released the movie for a mass market in a hurry rather than aim for a quality production.My greatest disappointment is that the commentary of the director is listed in the bonus section but is not included on the DVD.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AVCRD98TH48RN	D. Knouse	This is an ensemble film with romance, comedy, and loose ends. I'll start off with the negatives.  There are simply too many stories going on at once to make a complete film.  There were plenty of moments when I was wondering what happened next in another sub-plot, side-story, whatever.  Also, there were a few scenes where I was shaking my head.  Then I realized that this is a movie, so I let it slide.  One such moment comes when a 10-year-old boy is running through the airport looking for his one true love, and he is being chased by at least 4 security guards.  At one point the guards are apparently running at top speed (a mere 4mph--excuse me, this is England--try 10kph) with the child blazing ahead of them at a jog.  I know, I know, it's a movie!  But scenes like that that made the film falter.  As for the positives, and there are a lot here, the ensemble acting is refreshing and very well done.  Two performances stood out for me.  Emma Thompson, as usual, is excellent, showing once more her wide range of emotions and able to spin around and change direction on a dime(okay, a schilling).  The other great performance here comes from Laura Linney, and her situation is truly heartbreaking.  She finds love, but circumstances and timing just don't allow the great possibilities to unfold.  I wanted to give her a hug.  There are many other, fairly believable scenarios between other characters, some of which take a turn toward Hollywood sensationalism.  But overall, the emotions, and the universal need to be loved is present in nearly every frame of this film.  As for that aspect, this film is remarkable.  There are many humorous situations, a few emotionally difficult character moments, but the end result is one of hope.  As I said before, there are simply too many plots going on for a complete film to be possible, leaving many frayed and/or loose ends like, &quot;What ever happened to that character?&quot;  But that alone should be dully noted.  Why would I have cared about those characters if they hadn't been rendered so convincingly?  There are some over-the-top Hollywood moments, but they are forgivable because the heart of this film is in the right place.  Thank you.	4.0	Romance, comedy, loose ends.	2004-05-06	2	2	0

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3OXW1R2RMDXBX	"Donna Anastasi ""Spin the Plate"""	Hugh Grant is wonderfully charismatic and a master of self-deprecating humor. Being on a Hugh Grant kick lately I watched three of his films all in the same week. Love Actually, Sense & Sensibility, and 4 Weddings and a Funeral. Fun way to watch these movies because of the overlap in players and to understand classic British style: themes include tension between being proper and true to oneself, a wide cast of characters all intertwined, somehow, uncertainty of who will end up with who, extreme, offbeat secondary characters that are almost caricatures, and everything wrapped up neatly in the last 5-10 minutes of the film. Another commonality is the randomness of billing, clearly Grant was the star here but was billed fourth or fifth. This movie shows the many sides of love both the light hearted infatuation and in one scene with Emma Thompson how heart wrenching love can be. Many of the players (but not Hugh Grant) in this film were also in Nanny McPhee.	5.0	Quite British	2011-05-09	1	0	1

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3BGLVC6OZM2JW	"douglas barton ""emotions in motion"""	"Apparently Richard Curtis has been listening to far too many ' silly love songs. ' How else to explain how the same writer could produce such classics as "" Four Weddings And A Funeral "", "" Notting Hill "" and the brilliant Britcom "" Vicar of Dibley "" Well, we all have our 'off days' and with the release of "" Love Actually "" Mr. Curtis seems to be having a very bad day indeed!Lets be blunt though...I've rarely ever started a film with such high expectations and enthusiasm only to be, by the end of this movie, tearing out whats left of my once full head of hair and trying to remember where I'd left the key to the liquor cabinet. A more frustrating movie experience I don't think I've ever had! You would think that with all the acting talent that this film possess it would be a cake-walk. Just place Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant ( insert Brit thespian of your choice here please! ) and let the camera roll but, sadly, it looks as though someone inserted a tornado of a script here. For starters whoever deemed Hugh Grant, the poor mans Cary Grant, up to the task of playing the British PM should have his screen writers guild card taken away. In what can only be described as 'casting from Hell' Mr. Curtis developes a plot line concerning our randy single-minded PM and how he seems to be  "" searching for love in all the wrong places. "" Not only that but our misguided misanthropic PM even gets to grit his white teeth at the visiting President of the United States after our Commander-in-Chief makes an amorous advance toward a comely secretary. Smugly putting at risk many years of friendship and alliances simply due to Mr. Grant's getting his knickers in a twist over a rather average employee. The plot line is simply beyond ludicrous and, sadly, Mr, Curtis doesn't leave well enough alone.Theres more plots, sub-plots and the like going on here then Carters got liver pills! Poor Colin Firth...reduced to playing a writer who after discovering his wife is cheating with his brother ( family affair anyone? ) moves to France, meets an extremely average looking Portugese housemaid and voila! Runs off to learn her language, then off to his local arpt. to find the nearest flight to Portugal. Where in a fit of amore' professes his love and asks her father for her hand in marriage. Isn't love wonderful!? Of course all these events take scarcely a few days.God, there are so many truly insipid moments in this feature that I would have a difficult time conveying all of them but here dear reader is by far the silliest if not the most disingenuous. Liam Neeson playing a heart-broken widower ( is there any other? ) who is predictably depressed but after learning of his step-sons infatuation with a local school-girl is eager to help his young lad. Now all of this would be acceptable if it were not for the fact that the boy, a cute young 'un if there ever was one, is barely 10 yrs. old! How Mr. Curtis expects an audience to believe that even though his mother is barely laid to rest that our young man is simply far too much in love to bother with any feelings of loss and grieving is beyond me. In "" Love Actually "" apparently love is the only emotion our cast of Brits are required to feel, think or even give a moments thought of. All other emotions are simply brushed away as though they simply carry little if any importance. In fact Richard Curtis takes so many leaps of faith that any viewer would be wise to leave his/her common sense at the door when watching this movie. And I won't even bother to enlighten the reader as to how our young love-struck lad is able to artfully dodge a security heightened Heathrow police as he runs to tell his young paramour his true feelings. Its simply beyond awful when a writer of Mr. Curtis caliber needs to resort to 'cute' and 'precocious' to make a script work.Getting down to brass tacks here's the problem. Ok, heres one problem but its a big one! I truly love "" romantic comedies "" but in "" Love Actually "" Richard Curtis gives the genre a huge black-eye. First, for any romantic comedy to work you truly must care about the folks on the screen and the drama that unfolds before our very eyes. We fully expect a few tense moments,  a few miscommunications and even a few misadventures but you enjoy these awkward moments in hopes of our young couples finding their very own ' happy ending. ' In "" Love Actually "" there simply wasn't one person I could not only empathize with but one character who gave me any reason to care. The characters were poorly developed, one-dimensional and even, for the most part, self-absorbed. Plot lines were beyond silly and forced characters into quickly contrived situations that seemed haphazard and convenient. Plus, the idea of wasting the acting talents of Alan Rickman, protraying the typical lecherous husband under going a bad case of mid-life crisis was beyond reproach. Fact is Mr. Rickman looked thoroughly bored by the whole mindless event and I can't say he wasn't the only one having those feelings. Overall, a total disappointment and one in which I felt showed this writer being not only creatively lazy but one in which he shows no real insight into the complexities of love. A shame but what's on to do? Meg Ryan, please come home...all is forgiven!"	2.0	Love Sick	2005-04-16	37	25	12

It's a whirlwind series of (mostly) comedic romances set around the Christmas time, featuring an impressive collection of mostly British actors, each working out his or her own romantic tangle.The subplots cover a variety of situations: a single Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) falls for his attractive young caterer; a widower (Liam Neeson) guides his very young stepson through his first crush; a writer (Colin Firth) flees a failed relationship but falls for his Portuguese maid; and a middle-aged wife (Emma Thompson) suspects her husband is cheating on their relationship. Other vignettes include a young man's affection for his best friend's bride; two porn actors discovering real love, an aging rocker facing a lonely Christmas, and a sex-crazed youth seeking a friendly American female.The movie is predictable but loaded with lots of touching moments, moving quickly past a few plot gimmicks to linger in the right places.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AC9UO8H2VCZI2	Dwayne A. Day	"Did you ever see that ""Love Is"" comic strip which Homer Simpson once described as about ""two naked kids who are married""?  Love Actually is like that cartoon, just as complex and sophisticated, except smothered in honey and sugar, with a maraschino cherry on top, surrounded by dancing kittens and bunnyrabbits, as cherubs hover in the air humming.  In short, it is so overly sweet and cuddly that it makes you ill just looking at it.  Even if you love romantic films--I mean, really _LOVE_ romantic films--this one is going to make you sick to your stomach.For starters, the music that plays on the index screen of the DVD is the kind of romantic Muzak that accompanies late-night computer dating commercials on television.  Everything else in the movie and on the DVD is just as sappy and overdone.  The film tries so hard that it is scary.  One suspects that the writer and director really have some issues to work out with a therapist--as if they think they have finally discovered true love and happiness after marrying their third wives.The movie is about all the wonderful, mysterious, glorious ways that ""love"" enters our lives, and if that description doesn't make you groan, then read some of the blurbs that they stuck on the DVD box (any critic who calls a film ""the feel-good movie of the year!"" should be put out to sea in a rowboat with no oars).The movie starts with a narration by Hugh Grant telling us that love is everywhere and the proof is that all those people who made phone calls from the planes hijacked by the terrorists on 9-11 were calling loved ones.  Those were not calls of hate, we are told.  If you think about that a little bit you can see how seriously off-track this movie was right from the start.  Many of those calls were filled with terror and fear, and some of them were not made to loved ones but to law enforcement.  And how can one use this event to ""prove"" that love really is all around us when, if anything, those hijackings proved the immense power of hatred?Besides the overly sentimental and sugary tone of the entire movie, there are some other serious problems with this film.  For one thing, it is too long.  It clocks in at over two hours and clearly doesn't have enough story to support that length.  In fact, there is no single plot that drives the movie from the beginning to the end.  There is no real story, only a bunch of loosely-connected vignettes, each about five minutes long and quickly moving out of the way for the next one.What it has instead is characters, lots of characters.  Way too many of them, actually.  They are all supposed to be connected in some six-degrees-of-separation kind of way.  But this is a contrivance and we only find out that several of them know each other near the end, when they run into their friends at a school concert or the airport.  It's a lame way of saying that we are all connected.  But so what?  The movie would have been better to drop several of them and focus more time on a fewer number of characters that it could better flesh out--and tell real stories about, rather than how they each fell in love.One gets the sense that nobody was willing to rein in this director and tell him that his movie had gotten out of control.  Does he really need that many characters?  Do they really all need to be connected?  Do we really need a cameo by Denise Richards just so that we can laugh at the end and say 'Hey, look!  It's Denise Richards!'?  And why the heck didn't someone tell him that having two actor stand-ins for an adult film constantly mimicking sex is simply _not_ funny?  No matter how hard he tried, the director could not make a couple of naked people making chit-chat on a movie set seem cute.  (One almost has to feel sorry for these two actors, because when the movie inevitably gets edited for television, ALL of their scenes will be the first to go.)In fact, that sense of a runaway production is reinforced by watching the deleted scenes on the DVD.  These are introduced by the director and he reveals that his first cut of the movie came in at about three hours and twenty minutes and all of the scenes that got cut are among his favorites--including not one, but _two_ scenes shot of peasants in Africa proving that ""love really is everywhere.""  Watching them, it's clear that he had little self-control.  One wishes that somebody from the studio had told him to eliminate several of his actors and a bunch of the subplots and tighten the film up so that it had a point other than that love surrounds us, everywhere.I'm not being a curmudgeon.  I enjoy the occasional light romantic comedy (and I liked Notting Hill, which was an earlier work done by the people who brought you Love Actually).

For instance, I think the school teacher and her sick partner was touching and should have been kept. Also the old rock star's meeting with the record producers was hilarious, also should have been kept. What I think should have been removed was all the scenes with the necked stand-in couple. They just seemed out of place in this movie - if I wanted to see naked couples, I would have rented a different movie. Also the sound track is great - which I also purchased keep it in the car. Otherwise this movie is in my all time top 10.	5.0	In my all time top ten list	2010-11-30	4	2	2
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AQIRBENYADT43	Eddy	'Love Actually' is a breath of fresh air in the romantic comedy genre, a genre that is so often laden down with cliches and Richard Gere's latest claptrap. With an all star cast, 'Love Actually' takes us on a charming light-hearted jaunt through the festive season in the lives of a widely diverse selection of characters.The all star cast delivers a pitch perfect performance of a humourous tale of secret love and, for the most part, happy endings. Some of the more cold-hearted reviewers accuse it of being overly sappy, however these criticisms are misguided and irrelevant. 'Love Actually' makes no pretensions at being a 'hard hitting' or 'gritty' film. Instead it succeeds at being a heartwarming, festive tale admirably.Although 'Love Actually' was released as a christmas film, it is suitable to be watched at any time of year alongside your better half.	5.0	Lovely Stuff	2007-01-21	2	0	2
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AT6CZDCP4TRGA	Eduarrdo Nietzsche	"'Barely made it 34 minutes in, and I had to hit the Stop button, despite the abundance of female eye candy and perfectly played British humor.  ""Love Actually"" is so relentlessly cloying and emotionally manipulative that I found myself cringing and making hideous faces constantly.  The screenwriter should be taken out and summarily executed: it seems that almost EVERY SINGLE character in this film was cast and written to be as mind-numbingly sympathetic, cutesy and adorrrrable as possible...it was like watching an endless parade of lost helpless little puppies, each one wearing a sign yelping ""Please love me! Am I not just irresistible?""  And on top of this schmaltz-overdose, the whole thing is simply constructed of total implausibilities, gaping plot holes, cardboard characters, and coincidence-driven plot turns.The only way I managed to finish watching this sugary monstrosity: about halfway through, decided to turn off the sound and use subtitles instead, which was the only way to calm my gag reflex and dampen the constant cheese eruptions.  What a waste of an excellent cast.  It almost made me wonder whether this was actually meant to be a PARODY of a schmaltzy Christmas romantic flick.Truly, the most horrifying and gruesome movie in recent memory.  I never knew the Brits could match Hollywood for cinematic corniness...and then some. Even Steven Spielberg would be impressed."	2.0	INSULIN SHOCK!!!	2011-12-24	13	7	6

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2Q14AE2GSAE6T	E. Foster	"Below the sugar-coated surface, this is a deeply disturbing and profoundly bad movie.  What does this movie define as love?  Certainly not marriage, nor even commitment.  Of the marriages portrayed in the film, most contain adultery, lies, and misery (or death).  The relationships which are featured, and which, presumably, we're meant to think of as ""love,"" are infatuations, crushes, and lusts.  Despite the movie's reputation as a ""chick flick,"" one might note that several of the relationships involve powerful men falling for their vulnerable employees, hardly a model of 21st century feminism.  This movie contributes to the unhealthy and pervasive notion that love happens instantly, requires no communication (in one case, a couple falls in ""love"" without ever even speaking), and trumps all other considerations (for example, we're meant to sympathize with the lout who tries to seduce his best friend's wife).  The movie has no shame, either, alternating scenes meant to ""realistically"" portray how real people live and love with scenes so ludicrous as to defy belief (example: the sexually naive porn star?  the shy politician?  the American girls who sleep together naked?).  I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life on this rubbish..."	1.0	Love?  Actually, no...	2005-12-06	44	18	26

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3AWLFMKGRMI5M	E. Karasik	Had I reviewed this film immediately after watching it, I may have given it four stars, because it was fast-paced and fun. And there's boatloads of talent in the charismatic cast, but much of it is unexploited.  Outside the troubled Emma Thompson/Alan Rickman relationship, which was nuanced and credible, most of the cast (even the fabulous Liam Neeson) was wasted either on serious subplots that missed feeling authentic or attempts at humor that were severely overplayed.  The inconsistency in the film's viepoint made it feel very disjointed; one minute we're seeing a broad, indeed ridiculous vignette about an over-the-hill rock star (his butchered cover of &quot;Love is all Around&quot; by the Troggs made me so nostalgic for the real version I really thought it should have been included somewhere in the soundtrack); the next minute devastated widower Liam Neeson (always a delight, even in this unworthy role) is trying to connect with his young stepson, and then that turns into a farce about the stepson's improbable infatuation with a classmate. Watching the &quot;deleted scenes&quot; portion of the special features provided some insight into how the film became such a mishmash, and should offer a cautionary lesson for other filmmakers.	3.0	Entertaining but mostly forgettable	2004-05-03	5	4	1

Not only didn't we regret the purchase, we needed a second copy because the first was wearing out from so much usage!The various story lines are very cleverly woven together.  Each vignette stands alone, yet is connected in a ""Butterfly Effect"" way with others, so that we see the protagonists in one story being supporting characters in one or two others.  This one is the friend of that one.  That one works in the other one's office.  That one's child attends the same class as some other child with his own story.  (The ""first love"" tale is sweet.)  And so on.  Most of the acting is bang on, too.The thing is that with so many plots, there's something for everyone and for every mood; if it has to do with Love, you'll find it in Love, Actually.  One caveat, there is a homosexual relationship that was cut, and which you need to watch in the Deleted Scenes.  I wish it had been kept in, because it deals with a dying lover, which no other story line has.  (Though there is a story line with Liam Neeson about finding love again after the death of one's beloved, which is close.  And brilliantly done - he's a great actor in my book.)(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.  However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AC9B29BXXWJHD	Ellis Bell	"A great film, with a great cast. Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Rowan Atkinson, Keira Knightley, and many other stars play people who explore the theme of love over the Christmas holiday. With some great views of the city of London from the Thames, this movie will sweep you off your feet, so to speak.Beginning five weeks before Christmas, these characters explore love in many different ways. From the Prime Minister down through a kid who goes to America (Wisconsin, of all places!) in search of sex, all of these characters are exceptional in that they find something they are looking for. Its a very sweet comedy, though the relationships between the numerous couples are not well developed and slightly confusing. Some of the relationships are sad, such as the man who cheats on his wife, and the woman who can't commit to a relationship because of her brother's condition; but for the most part, many of them find love, such as the Prime Minster, who runs from house to house on Christmas Eve looking for the woman he loves. Most funny, however, is the aged potty-mouth rock star Billy Mack, whose song ""Christmas is all around us"" provides a backdrop to the whole movie (as the original words to the song were ""Love is all around us"").Most hopeful, I thought, was the man who is in love with his best friend's wife, who eventually gets to tell her how he feels about her. Another relationship which made me smile was the one between the young boy and the girl from his school, and the relationship between the British expatriot author and the Portugese housekeeper.This is a a great all-around romantic comedy, if you can keep track of all that goes on, and the relationships between certain couples."	4.0	"""Love is all around us..."""	2004-10-15	6	5	1

I guess I should have been born in the United Kingdom, because this film features some of my favorite actors ... all Brits, of course.

Weinhold ""Lolly"""	_Love Actually_ is being touted as &quot;THE ULTIMATE ROMANTIC COMEDY&quot;, and while some of the relationships were sweet and romantic, I became frustrated with the sheer amount of storylines in the film.  The overall film suffered because it had to rotate between the relationships--each couple got their requisite five miunte screen time (with some overlap) and then SWITCH!  The really interesting stories were cut off to show another scene that was silly and unnecessary.  (The biggest example of this is leaving Laura Linney's character &quot;out to dry&quot;--what happened to her?)The reason why everyone is seeing this movie is because of the stellar cast, and while they all performed very nicely, all of their characters were severely underdeveloped, and it was hard to have any connection with the characters when you knew so little about them.  The film would have been much more enjoyable had they focused on three or four relationships (namely Rickman-Thompson, Liam Neeson, and Hugh Grant's characters) and developed them more fully.	3.0	Good storylines... but they tried to do too much	2004-05-08	0	0	0

The cast is impressive both in number of people in the film and in the quality of actors (Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, just to name a few) and the film is a mad dash sort of romantic comedy careening toward the Christmas climax. The story follows possibly eight couples who are trying to get together, falling in love, just discovering their true feelings, making their true feelings known, giving in to their feelings or saying ""to heck with convention"", and going above and beyond the call of duty for love. It touches in a shallow, but not wholly unsatisfying, way the various trials and triumphs of different types of love and does so in an entertaining way. The fact that the characters here could be as well developed as they are (given their sheer numbers) is remarkable and laudatory. Still there is something a bit saccharine about the whole thing, but the viewer will probably forgive because the director is new at directing, because it is a sort of heartwarming and cute story, and because the performances are all good.

Well, no, not exactly.This movie would have you singing in the streets, believing that love is all around.  Different types of ""love"" are explored in it.  The love of sister for brother, of client and agent (aww), of man for woman (who cannot speak the same language), etc etc etc.  But truly, the movie's 8 stories do not ever really come together to form a coherent whole.  Each one of them is slightly more ridiculous than the previous, culminating in a trip to Portugal of such unbelievable proportions that I found myself nauseated, actually.  Every single ""character"" in this movie is a homonculus and it's not even funny when it comes right down to it.  A man in love with his best friend's fiance?  Hilarious, right?  A mid-life crisis forces a husband and father unto infidelity?  Hah hah hah.  What a spiffy comedy!I feel sorry for every stellar actor in this movie because they are all tragically underused, while I felt really used at the end of watching this stale piece of work."	1.0	Sucks....

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AMKCZHXDOS2RN	E. Spencer Garrett IV	I liked this movie but the sexual situations means that you should not allow children to see it.  The sad part is that by eliminating the two porn movie stand-ins (whose characters are undeveloped anyway) this movie would have been better and more appropriate for teenagers.In fact that is about the only false note in this movie.  There are just too many couples to follow in one sitting.That said, I laughed out loud thru much of this movie.  Some people have compared this to Four Weddings and a Funeral but I enjoyed this more.  The pairing of the author and the housekeeper who cannot speak to one another is funny throughout the movie as is the guy who thinks that since he cannot find love in England it is simply because he is on the wrong continent.  Hugh Grant is dead on as a new Prime Minister- he looks as uncomfortable playing the role as you would imagine a man newly elected to the position would really feel.Great flick!	4.0	Fun but not for Children!	2006-05-10	3	1	2
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2KVUJ8G5PH606	essiefunk	As with &#34;The Holiday&#34; movie, this is modern with each characters'  stories touched with the old theme of finding love, peace and harmony in their lives.  Each story is creatively intertwined with one another.  Humorous, poignant, delightfully touching and sentimental.  There are a few scenes of brief nudity and adult situations, so maybe not for the whole family.	5.0	Another holiday movie to watch every year!	2012-12-12	1	0	1

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1VMYP2MPF3NB8	Fabian Wilfred	Now, how many of us have actually experienced love in real life the way actors and actresses portray it in films? Love actually brings together a very potent mix of comedy and romanticism into its whole state of affairs. You get several situations in this film all of which are connected to love and that of course is the main ingredient. Set in the very English environment you get the best of everything. The characters are excellent on their own, from the prime minister of Britain to the lonely office girl downtown, to the fading rock star, love is simply all around. What makes this movie special is the down to earth element that simply decides to sell well. Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Kiera Knightly, Martine McCutcheon, Alan Rickman, Laura Linney, Bill Nighy and Rowan Atkinson all come together to deliver one excellent holiday movie, in a very long time, not to forget the excellent soundtrack to boot.	4.0	A very heartwarming flick...	2004-03-09	44	35	9

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A13TQC4BLDD7UJ	"Fixer ""dallasdr"""	"I generally don't write movie reviews but I felt compelled to in this case.  Before I decided to see the movie I went online and read several reviews.  Though there were a few dectractors, the overwhelming number of reviews were positive so decided to see it.I wish I would have listened to the detractors. Don't let the cast fool you, this was definitely one of the worst movies I have every seen.  It is NOT funny, insighful, sentimental, smart, charming, or entertaining.  All the characters are either fools or idiots, the relationships are juvenile, and the jokes typically revolve around being vulgar in inappropriate places--a tired joke that's made more tired by this movie.  I could have forgiven all of it's other failings if it would have just delivered on one dimension, but it didn't.  I wanted to laugh, but it wasn't funny.  I wanted to be stimulated to think, but the storylines were too cliche.  I wanted to like the characters, but they were uninteresting bores or outrageous dolts.If the movie is trying to make a statement about love, it fails miserably.  What passes for love in this movie is little more than a combination of adolescent fantasy and a couple different underdeveloped hollywood cliches about relationships.  It's not a ""complex"" portrayal of love as some have said, it's a silly, shallow confusion of love with immature psychological attachment with a little bit of sex mixed in.  It is a truly sad, pathetic film."	1.0	Warning, save your money!!!	2003-11-08	20	8	12

Two examples would be the relationship between Liam Neeson and his son...and Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman.

There were random relationships thrown about without any real underlying theme or story.  Many of the interactions were just plain stupid.

For Americans it can be somewhat interesting challenge to follow for it's British sensitivities, but the point of the movie is well played out. The part of the Prime Minister was a bit overdone, but the love interest very enjoyable to watch. Also, the acting and delivery of the 'couple' that couldn't speak each other's language was well played. The skits about the couple who were nude standins didn't make much sense.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1ZHDT4BWFEO0K	F. W. Young	"""Love Actually"" is a horrid film - poorly written, completely implausible, filled with chemistry-free relationships and gross manipulations that fall completely flat.To point out every flaw would take longer than the 1,000 words, but as an example, the film starts with a narration - over shots of happy people in an airport - talking about the constant nature of love in a post 9/11 world.  Later in the film, a kid runs past airport security and the resulting chase is played for good natured laughs.  Other - a man buries his wife and a week later is told he should start dating again.  A mish mash of tone - one of the couples featured meets on athe set of a film where they are body doubles who simulate sex all day, while the path to true love for another couple is barricaded by her mentally challenged and violent older brother - and style - a dissolving marriage contrasted to a Penthouse Forum type fantasy - that ultimately adds up to 135 minutes of jaw-dropping inanity, this is a film that gives romantic comedies a bad name.Beautifully shot though."	1.0	A Well Crafted Train Wreck	2004-05-10	32	15	17

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2BPDFR58H9575	Galina	Love, Christmas, London, EnglandRichard Curtis, the talented writer of the very successful Four Weddings and Funeral, Nottting Hill, and Bridget Jones' Diary, and one of Mr. Bean's the creators, wrote and directed Love Actually, and what a directing debut it is. The ultimate romantic dramedy, the film that is not ashamed to be sweet, heartwarming, and outrage romantic. Love Actually talks about love, romances, break-ups, moving on, and does it admirably. This is the film I can watch over and over - during Christmas time or spring time, or summer, and it always brings warmth, humor, laughs, sadness, and yes, Love that is everywhere, just look a little closer. This is the film that makes me smile and even brings the tears to my eyes - all at once. Love Actually gives romantic comedy its good name back. It is a very good movie - sometimes, close to perfect, gorgeous, sweet in the good sense of the word and always lovely.First, and foremost, I admire the film for outstanding (and I mean it) cast. Some of the best British and American and European actors (and there is also simply gorgeous Rodrigo Santoro who deserves a special mention) play twenty or even more Londoners who were hit by the Cupid's arrow during the Christmas season of 2003 in absolutely stunningly looking, lively and bright London. I won't be original if I say that the funniest character belongs to Bill Nighy as once super-famous rock star (in Keith Richard's type) who is making his comeback with an old love song that he is turning in the Christmas super hit. Another outstanding performance belongs to divine Emma Thompson. She brings depth and real emotions into her and Alan Rickman's story of the marriage in crisis. Laura Linney's story of love that was so close and possible but not meant to be was also very well told and acted.This time, Liam Neeson's story as a newly widower with the young step-son who is desperately in love with the most popular girl in school, touched me the most. After recent untimely tragic death of Neeson's wife, the mother of his two sons, Natasha Richardson, the story feels the most poignant and sweetest. The scene during Daniel's wife funeral, his speech celebrating Joanna's life, moved me almost to tears.Yes, it is a long movie and it tells the stories of 20 people or so who all happen to live, work, fell in love, sometimes have their hearts broke in London that I've never seen so bright and lovely as in this picture - perhaps, because the stories start five weeks prior to Christmas and end on Christmas night. With so many intertwining stories, not all of them are equally good. Some could be dropped, leaving the movie shorter, leaner, and perhaps better but even the way it is, Love Actually deserves its place on such top lists as Best of 2003, Favorites, and Favorite Romance. It is beautiful and magical - just like the season during which it takes place.	4.0	Life is full of interruptions and complications but true love lasts a lifetime.	2009-04-30	3	1	2

I actually believed Hugh Grant to be the ""Tony Blair"" Prime Minister of England -- IF only England were so lucky to have such a great PM not to accept the Iraq war based on lies and tell Bush to shove it -- as Hugh Grant did to Billy Bob Thornton (who played a dumb American Bush-like president).How could anyone not LOVE this movie?  It has a wonderful cast, great music, is wildly unique and definitely a feel good movie.  I highly suggest any progressive person out there that likes great movies to watch -- be amazed -- and wonder ""if only life was this good?""Love, Actually is tender, it moves the soul for people of all ages, whether you are 10 or 90, this movie is a cross-generational appreciation of all types of love.  From lust to secret admirers, this film showcases a myriad of lives and reality.  This is the most I can say without giving too much away but at the rate it is selling for, buy it!

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1RJJ56MBJMX87	Gavin Wilson	"This is a highly instructive DVD, because it shows how a half-decent film could have been even better. The deleted scenes included on this DVD are of exceptionally high quality, and makes you yearn for an extended 'Director's Cut'.As Curtis says in his introduction, he shot far too many scenes, and was forced to prune 80 minutes' worth. Whole characters are deleted from the movie -- e.g. the headmistress, her lover (Frances de la Tour), and most of Emma Thompson's wayward son. Personally, I feel this approach is undesirable, when it means that you as the director have to explain to several major actors that none of their scenes is in the final movie.The editing decisions that Curtis forced upon himself explain why the film at the cinema appeared to be a bit of a dog's dinner, redeemed by a number of uplifting sub-plots. The extras included with DVD encourage the viewer to try to build their own version. Personally I would eliminate the annoying brother-in-the-asylum sub-plot. The story of the two nude stand-ins is the least integrated with the other plots, and removing that story would also help to make the film more child-friendly.Heavy with a head-cold, Curtis also explains why he chose five of the key tunes in the movie. It's clear that music, particularly as created by female singer-songwriters, is a very central part of Curtis's life. Viewing that interview has directly led to my ordering the referenced Joni Mitchell CD from Amazon.The commentary is rather fun, provided by Curtis, Grant, Nighy (occasionally) and the 10-year-old boy. Curtis frequently feeds Grant with opportunities to diss Colin Firth -- e.g. when Curtis mentions that the French villa used for the writer's refuge has subsequently burnt down, Grant asks ""Was Colin still in it?"". Curtis starts the commentary, by the way, five minutes before Grant arrives -- stuck in traffic -- and soon after his arrival, Grant has to take a mobile call from his golf coach. The banter is generally at this Oxford level, and Nighy seems left out. Curtis is also aware that the 10-year-old probably shouldn't be watching a 15-certificate film, but the lad does OK.As for the movie itself, I still maintain that it proves that Emma Thompson is the finest actress of her generation. A big [disappointment] that she didn't get best supporting actress at the Oscars.Anyway, see what you think. Curtis's DVDs always get the most repeated viewing in our household. Definitely worth investing in. A 4-star film with a 5-star commentary."	5.0	Four-star movie with a five-star commentary	2004-03-22	3	2	1

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AAEP8YFERQ8FC	General Breadbasket	"Seasoned British comedy writer Richard Curtis pens ""Love Actually"", a uniquely sequenced romantic comedy of sorts centred around the weeks leading up to Christmas. A lot of well known actors are in it too - Liam Neeson, Rowan Atkinson, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, and Keira Knightley, for instance.The film is made up of many strands and stories, many people's lives, loosely linked, whose plot revolves around the theme of love. One of the strands include a love triangle between the British Prime Minister (Hugh Grant), the US President and 10 Downing St's tea lady, which results in a diplomatic scuffle between the two countries (my favorite part of the film). There's also a cheesy comeback from a jaded old rock star, a cover of ""Love is All Around Me"" that replaces the word ""love"" with ""Christmas"", two nude centrefold models who fall in love while posing together, an 11 year old boy with a crush on an American girl in his class, and an English man on a trip to America to find a foreign love interest of his own. With all the plots, it does keep things intriguing, especially when the stories interact and cross each other.The way the film is constructed is interesting, but the content isn't quite as much I don't think. I didn't feel the emotion really, and in a film that's kind of significant. The emotions are handled in a very English way, which seems a fairly genuine representation but, just like when Australian films deal with love, doesn't really pull at the heartstrings terribly much. With all the little interwoven stories, it's a little hard to get involved in any one character's life too deeply. Maybe it takes more viewings. My girlfriend has seen it a couple of times, and she tends to think it's that way with this film.Special features include a selection of music videos (including the full version of the ""Christmas is All Around Me"" video used in the film), deleted scenes, the original theatrical trailer and an audio commentary with writer Richard Curtis, Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy and Thomas Sangster.Not the best British film around, not the best film about love around, but it's okay, actually."	3.0	It's Okay, Actually	2006-08-20	5	4	1

The range of emotions from Grant's silly dance at 10 Downing Street; marriages issues of Thompson and Rickman; Linney's psychotic brother; and Firth's loss combined with good cinematography and music hooked us the very first time. We never tire of watching it.	5.0	A Good Christmas Movie	2014-03-13	0	0	0
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3FUAGZZ6AF8XM	Geoffrey Kidd	"My wife took me to this movie on the basis of ""We need a night out,"" and ""There's nothing else in the theaters.""  The trailers had made some of the moments in this movie look horribly embarassing to watch, so I was NOT eager.The movie, however, was a delightful surprise, full of good people trying to deal with life's unpredictability and find the time to show each other that they care, and deeply.  There are funny moments galore, and almost any of the major performances in this film are Oscar-level material.  And I wasn't embarassed a bit about any of it.There are three relationships that turned it into a ""Boy am I glad I saw this"" film.  Colin Firth as Jamie Bennett and the Portuguese girl he falls in love with without ever being able to exchange a word because he doesn't speak Portuguese and she doesn't speak english, Liam Neeson as the widower and his son who are each trying to deal with the loss and find new path in life, while the son chases a girl who apparently doesn't even notice he's alive, and Hugh Grant, as the Prime Minister, finding love in a place he'd never thought to look.I'd give it five stars, except that the soundtrack features some of the most G_d-awful slop pop on the planet, very poor as background music when compared against Craig Armstrong's love themes. Armstrong's work is, in my opinion, some of the most beautiful music ever composed, and my best composers company includes Bach and Beethoven.Between the acting and Craig Armstrong, this one's a keeper."	4.0	Joy, warmth, caring, and, yes, love, actually	2004-02-12	2	0	2

(I guess it had to be for the money-I hope they made lots!) I purchased this movie on DVD simply because it featured actors that I hold in high regard, and with the expectation of a non-run-of-the-mill Hollywood-type holiday movie.  I WAS WRONG.  This has to be the most Hollywood-type, Hallmark made-for-Television move that I have ever seen (something I try to avoid, at all costs)-with even the ubiquitous black-gospel choir singing dippy love songs and Xmas carols.  While at the same time it is a movie about the most un-diverse group of dreary people that I have seen in a recent film for a very long time.  I had hoped for, at least, an ethnic couple of some sort or a gay couple of some kind.  Instead we are served up a bunch of very boring people having love problems including a cherubic grade school boy in love with another cherubic girl who OF COURSE leads the kiddies, in school, at Xmas time, in song with not one word of the song being intelligible.  Which brings me to another point-why did every featured seasonal musical number have to disintegrate into some pseudo rock, gospel type (come to the Lord) song?  Was it to appeal to the masses or to show that the people making this clunker were very very hip? Anyway buy this film if you are into sappy holiday movies and would love to see Hugh Grant dance (which is actually the best part of the film).	1.0	SAPPY	2004-05-25	29	12	17

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1JVSIWDF0WT22	GeValero	There's plenty to love about LOVE ACTUALLY. It's just that I found a couple of the stories downright perverse. It may be convenient for the film not to show us where Keira Knightley's new romance will lead but nothing changes the fact that is not a love story but one of betrayal in which not much good will come out at the end; at least the Alan Rickman / Emma Thompson part is honest about its subject and what the consequences to his actions will eventually be for both of them. Further, what can you say about a story in which a girl is unfaithful to his boyfriend with his own brother ? The funny thing is that the filmakers want to make us believe these are just different facets of love and for some reason, they time them at Christmas time, as if they would actually have anything to do with the real meaning of Christmas.Still, any movie in which Hugh Grant makes a convincing British Prime Minister can't be all bad. The truer love story in LOVE ACTUALLY ?: Laura Linney giving up on her dream for the sake of her brother, that part might just be enough to justify the title.	4.0	Lust Actually	2009-06-18	1	0	1

I knew it wasn't a good sign when the F-bomb and the S-bomb started flying barely 3 minutes into the film.There were about 5 stories of various characters throughout the film.  Some were sort of cute but others were absolutely ridiculous and improbable.  One of the primary things that bothered me about the film was the attitude that many of the characters had toward sex.  Sex was treated as merely an activity that any two (or more) people of any sex could do.  Nevermind morality or marriage vows.  It's interesting that the film would be titled, ""Love Actually"" when many of the characters were jumping into bed with basically whatever moved (regardless of whether they loved the other person or not).In addition, I agree with what another reviewer said about it being blasphemous.  There was a scene where a child was telling her mother that she was going to be in a play in which she would play a lobster during the nativity scene of Christ.

Since these are stories of love in it's many forms rather than, say, an apocalyptic zombie movie, it shouldn't have that much of a gap in its suspension of disbelief.The stories I enjoyed the most were those of Linney's dysfunctional fraternal bond and Nighy's humbling realization at the end of his musical career ( he's one of my fave actors! ).

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A328S9RN3U5M68	Grady Harp	LOVE, actually, is exactly what makes this noisy, crazy, absurd, hostile world function and once again Director Richard Curtis proves that good writing, good casting, and fast-paced direction can, in his hands, produce another treasurable gem of a film.It is all in the title - beginning and ending a film capturing the myriad people arriving and leaving at a busy gate  at Heathrow Airport in London, freeze-framing some of those precious fleeting moments into  extended and interrelated stories, and in doing so Curtis has created a film that is more than what the doctor ordered for a seasonal ( no, year-round) dollop of medicine to cure almost everyone's current disillusionment.There are many stories about relationships: ones that are worn thin (the tenderness of Emma Thompson facing Alan Rickman's marital wanderings); ones that develop (Colin Firth at his very finest as a stuffy writer who loses his heart to a Portuguese speaking maid - Lucia Moniz), Keira Knightly/Andrew Lincoln, Chiwetal Ejofor in a puzzling and surprising extended love situation, Laura Linney shyly in love with the always superb Rodrigo Santoro but quietly and sincerely sacrificing that possibility in favor of caring for her mentally ill brother; and relationships that are created out of needs beyond the status quo (Hugh Grant as his usual British self and Prime Minister at that, in love with his new secretary0, Liam Neeson as a warm widowed father who helps his winsome son pledge his love for an 'impossible reach' American girl, and the ever creative Bill Nighy zanily discovering his love for his chubby male manager).  There are other people we encounter such as Rowan Atkinson, again hilarious in his most understated role, Billy Bob Thornton as the US President who evokes a hefty bit of British response to the current USA International presence, and so many more.  These varied sorts are all brought together as Christmas approaches and in the end we see them literally fade into the melange of the facelessness of Heathrow airport - making the cirle come round.Yes, there is a bit of raw humor and there may be those who take it out of context and consider it crude.  But I think it is to Richard Curtis' credit that he makes such diversions simply part of the quilt that connects us all.  This film is exploding with tenderness, warmth, laughter, and US, ACTUALLY.

The difference with this movie is that it actually contains comedians. Two of my favorite UK comedians-Rowan Atkinson and Kris Marshall. I knew that even though this was romantic it certainly would be funny. It was hysterical and realistic.My favorite performances in the film were from these two actors. Kris Marshall as the goofy sandwhich seller turned ladies man in Wisconsin of all places had me in stitches. In all of the reviews I have read I have noticed that Kris Marshall has been very underestimated especially in the U.S. In all of his roles be they comic or tragic he puts his whole heart and soul into it. The same can be said for the many comic roles of Rowan Atkinson who is more well known to international audiences. When Kris or Rowan take on a scene it belongs to them. They own it!

Director Richard Curtis's inspiration for this film originated from when he languished at the L.A.X. airport for hours and - by dint of witnessing all the folks hugging and kissing - arrived at the mini-epiphany that ""Hey, love really is all around."" LOVE ACTUALLY, featuring a legitimately all-star cast, tracks its many characters thru the four weeks leading up to Christmas as they struggle and find and lose love. There are at least nine story threads - I just tried counting them off in my brain - and they occasionally interweave.All story arcs not being equal, Hugh Grant is featured in the flashiest one. He plays the new British Prime Minister who arrives at his bailiwick and is instantly smitten with the earthy food caterer (played by a delightful Martine McCutcheon). To give Hugh his props, hands down the best moment in the film is when his Prime Minister stands up to the semi-slimy U.S. president during a press conference. Two other prominent threads revolve around the unexpected romance between a reserved writer (Colin Firth) holidaying in France and his quiet Portuguese cleaning woman and Liam Neeson's grieving widower left to raise a young step-son who's fallen in love with a girl in his school.But love isn't all bright and heady, exciting and new. Sometimes, it's melancholy and dreadful and gut-wrenching. Emma Thompson is phenomenal in a supporting role, playing a wife of long standing who is suddenly ambushed by her husband's infidelity. Laura Linley sacrifices her chance at romance to be there for her needy institutionalized brother. Keira Knightley is the focus of unrequited love, and she and Andrew Lincoln provide my second favorite moment from this film. The sequence at the door step in which a luminous Keira is silently serenaded by Andrew Lincoln's cue cards is simultaneously heartbreaking and romantic as fucl&lt;.Rowan Atkinson has a nice cameo as a jewelry salesman, and it's probably best that Curtis refrained from portraying him as literally an angel (Curtis admits this in the audio commentary). Bill Nighy steals all the scenes as the aging and very blunt-talking rock star who gets one last shot at glory with his Christmas jingle. The sub-plot with that British bloke raring to go to America to find true love, I didn't think that was going anywhere. But damn if it didn't have a nice payoff. I think the only one left I haven't mentioned is the arc with the two actor stand-ins, and now I've mentioned it. That one also has its sweet moments, which is rather a coup, considering that a segment featuring a persistently naked couple engaged in simulating the deed could be construed as a bit sleazy.LOVE ACTUALLY is a sprawling narrative which covers a wide romantic spectrum. Don't be put off by the huge cast because you'll find yourself invested in quite a few of the characters. This is absolutely a chick flick, but, for the manly men, the funny does come in frequent like clock work. Hugh Grant is again very good, with his Prime Minister dance and that bit where he goes down the block, knocking at every door, looking for his food caterer. I do have one neggy, though. I think it's stretching it a bit that Colin Firth's writer and his Portuguese girl can be in such conversational synch while speaking two different languages and not comprehending each other. But perhaps the point is that love is universal and can hurdle silly obstacles such as language barriers and Colin Firth being very British and therefore a bloody cold fish. See what I did there? I reasoned it out and so saved the movie's internal logic. Huzzah!My favorite line here, by the way, is sub-titled: ""Shut up, Miss Dunkin' Donut 2003."" Heh.The DVD's bonus features: Audio Commentary with actors Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy, and Thomas Sangster and director Richard Curtis (worth it alone for Hugh's good-natured but relentless ribbing of Colin Firth); 10 Deleted Scenes with intro by Richard Curtis (totaling 00:37:14 minutes); ""The Music of LOVE ACTUALLY"" - Richard Curtis introduces the songs used to score the film and then the DVD cuts to the actual scenes featuring these songs; and Kelly Clarkson's music video ""The Trouble With Love Is."""	5.0	"""Okay, dad, let's do it.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AL8IDHJPCE00K	H	"What is not to love about this movie? I am a huge Hugh Grant fan. His charming, self-depreciating humor, mixed with his accent is always a win for me, I honestly did not know he was in it when I saw this movie by accident the first time. Love Actually is a story with a lot of moving parts. There are about 8 different stories going on at once, different types of love, of love stories....siblings taking care of one another, new love, infedility, unrequited love, loss of a spouse, first love....and all the stories are intertwined in a perfect quilt of a story. It won't lose you though....don't worry about that. It's easy to watch, and funny, and true. The cast is amazing, Hugh Grant, Collin Firth, Keira Knightley, and more. They way people relate to each other is odd, true and striking, and it just seems to resonate the love people feel for each other above anything else. Love actually is....all around.Besides, who doesn't like to see cute Hugh Grant shaking his tail to the 80's hit "" Jump""?CAUTION- there are some partly nude scenes in here. I've had some friends tell me they let their kids watch not realizing. It's otherwise a great movie, it's a shame for the nude scenes because it's otherwise a good movie for the family. But, the nature of the nudity is pretty funny...just probably not the best thing for young viewers."	5.0	I actually love LOVE ACTUALLY	2007-06-16	5	3	2
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A19Z7T7BH0FLUH	"Hilary Blackshaw ""hilly235"""	"The best thing about Love Actually was watching it in an American movie theater with Americans. The film is for the most part, wonderful. Of course, it has its flaws - and many people have suggested that 8 different love stories is simply too much for one film. I think that is the whole point. We are introduced to a world where ""love actually is all around"" - to focus on one of these couples would not emphasise this point as well.One of my favourite aspects of the film was the cameo roles. Ant and Dec appear as themselves: children's TV presenters and discuss the physical attributes of Blue, a 'real' British boy band (I assume this broke a few teenage girls' hearts). Claudia Schiffer, Denise Richards and Shannon Elizabeth, but to name a few, all contribute to this wonderful cast. Blink, and you'll miss them. Emma Thompson astounded me with her acting. I have never been a fan, but the scene in which she controls her tears in the bedroom after unwrapping her Christmas gift seemed to reflect the trueness of marriage along with its difficulties. Keira Knightley will go far. She impressed me in Pirates of the Carribbean, and my only regret is that her role was not larger in this film.In fact, the film made me homesick. Seeing London at Christmas is magical, and Curtis has managed to capture such magic beautifully on screen. I don't think I have ever been so emotional in a movie theater before. If you like romance, and particularly if you like London and all things British, watch this film. I laughed and cried. A lot."	5.0	Love actually is British - this time	2004-04-13	2	1	1

I sat through the whole thing waiting for something to happen to redeem it.  Didn't happen.Not only does this movie have absolutely nothing to do with Christmas (other than apparently the ending of the movie takes place on Christmas day), but really, all it has to do with is shallow people looking for love or more accurately stated, sex.  That's right, sex.  This movie illustrates perfectly the average person's massive confusion between LOVE and LUST.  I found the movie pretty sad, pathetic really.

Some have criticised the film for lack of depth but I think that this actually makes the film smart and appealing.Hugh Grant is completely hilarious as the British Prime Minister, my God I'd vote for him!  For those reviewers who didn't like his treatment of the American President character, I say get over it.  The American President is played by Billy Bob Thornton; a real sleazy bully type.  Those of us who aren't American and who are a bit sick of the American President throwing his weight and limited intellect around, were cheering quietly along with Hugh Grant's character.Liam Neeson's character is beyond funny, completely post-modern and his relationship with his son is touching.  I'm not a huge fan of romantic comedy but I laughed out loud throughout thisfilm.

Overall the movie resonates and stayes with you long after it's over.

Hugh Grant is very good as the British prime minister. His love interest is touching. The episodes with the US president capture, in my view, an opinion shared by many in UK. London comes out as a pleasant place to live. The script is authentic too, using language as it's normally spoken. Colin Firth captures this and the sentimental side of matters, with his Portuguese housekeeper. There is poignancy between Laura Linley's character and that of her mentally disabled brother. There are more vignettes including a sample of Rowan Atkinson's precise diction, during his fastidious wrapping of a Christmas present. All the disparate elements come together in the end. It is clever and if one needs a movie 'pick-me-up', this is one to watch. It's a delight!Ian Hunter.Author of `e-Love'.	4.0	A good pick-me-up!	2011-04-23	3	2	1

I think this is a perfect movie to watch after a divorce or breakup. The lesson is simple. Love is everywhere, but in love it isn't possible to posses someone: the most one can do is to belong to them. If you don't want to belong to a girl, it means you are not actually in love. Despite a kind of happy end, it is a tragi-comedy with some relationships actually failing. I rooted for Laura Linney and Rodrigo Santoro, but alas, their romance went south. Billy Bob Thornton as an evil President is a great comical injection of politics. He was brilliant in his little role. Emma Thompson is fantastic as usual.

After all, the film has multiple storylines, dozens of main characters, and a first-time director. However, Richard Curtis delivers a totally unique movie that is heart-warming, funny, and incredible!The movie is, simply put, about relationships. As Hugh Grant's voiceover states at the beginning of the film: &quot;Husbands and wives, fathers and sons, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. I've got a sneaky feeling that if you look for it, you'll find that love actually is all around.&quot; The film makes its way through the lives of many different characters and their experiences of love. And, like the movie itself, the stories are woven together in a seamless tapestry of emotion.The performances by everyone in the film are incredible. Liam Neeson plays a touching step-dad to Thomas Sangster's Sam, while Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman make the perfect married couple. Hugh Grant delivers a sparkling performance as the Prime Minister, while Colin Firth once again smoulders as a heartbroken writer. Kiera Knightly is refreshing as a new bride, and Laura Linney adds some American charm. Bill Nighy's hilarious performance as former rock and roller Billy Mack unites all of these tales. Other stars in more &quot;minor&quot; roles include Billy Bob Thorton, Rowan Atkinson, January Jones, Denise Richards, and Claudia Schiffer.The first time I saw the film, I was impressed by its storytelling, continuity, and beauty.

It's Christmas time again in London as unexpected (almost magical) things happen in very simple, heartening ways to the most unlikely people.

The love we receive from those unknown people to us (sometimes form those who show slight animosity toward us.)The characters will capture your heart (Emma Thompson is phenomenal.)

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1GRXAYL28V2W3	Ivan C. H. Liu	This is such a heart-warming and touching story, with the usual British style humour, which is very charming. Several love stories told in parallel to each other, with the characters somehow connected in life, I find the characters are more realistic than most of the romantic films. For example, we're not always brave enough to confront to someone. And even if we are brave enough, it seldom is like the typical love movie where the guy gives a passionate speech. In this film, there are full of this kind of characters and moments, which I think most of us can relate to.This film is particularly successful at portraiting the character's inner emotions, which is done in a very convincing way, with nice background music and not too much talking. Some elements of this film might be cliches, but if you don't want any cliche then I suggest you to go to another department.In summary I enojoyed this film, and I recommend it.	5.0	Absolutely lovely	2004-05-30	1	0	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3LP5RUMWG7GQ0	I. Westray	&quot;Love Actually&quot; is a blandly commercial product. Its writing is abysmally trite and predictable; among the many plot twists there was one that didn't take the most obvious course, but it took the second most obvious one. To disguise the mediocrity (to be charitable) of that writing, the movie relies on the old change-of-pace method: it hops skittishly among plots so the limited arc of any given line won't be exposed quite as painfully.The one thing the movie has going for it is casting. It wastes most of this advantage. Colin Firth, for seemingly the 40th time in his career, is wasted as a milquetoast romantic interest in the mold of Hugh Grant's earlier career. (What the heck has Firth done to deserve this sort of wasting death as a movie actor? He must be paying the bills so he can do theater or something.) Liam Neeson does brilliantly with a funeral speech that's wretchedly, glaringly, ploddingly badly written, and spends the rest of the movie playing second fiddle to one more precocious, unlikeable kid actor. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are cast as a couple, and they manage to drag the material up for air a couple of times. There's even a moment with Rowan Atkinson when the proceedings almost gain a little life. Laura Linney might be pretty good -- but she's in one of those romances where the people don't talk to each other when they have a chance, because otherwise everyone would be too happy too fast to make a movie of things. I'm forgetting a bunch of roles, all of them cast with pretty good actors. (Keira Knightly's the only really painful presence in the movie. The same mannerisms, over and over, are hard to watch.) All of the actors walk through stories that couldn't be more contrived, though.Did I mention that the movie uses airports as a point of departure both for various characters and for their plotlines? And that they then return to the airports at the end, to finish things off?So: Lots of actors in a cobbled-up group of weak (weak, weak) plotlines that hop around, with a sort of &quot;point of departure and return&quot; motif. This is the most well-produced episode of a certain television program you'll ever want to see. By about halfway through, what I wanted to know was -- where's Julie McCoy? Doc? Isaac? Gopher? The whole &quot;Captain's table for dinner&quot; conceit would have at least allowed things to connect to each other...Yes, it was that mediocre.	2.0	Will remind you of a certain TV show	2004-06-28	5	1	4
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1RBPJO4C0U32C	Jack Flack	Am amazing movie. It's difficult to explain how good it is. The story lines are interesting, funny, well acted and in large part unpredictable. The recent spate of negative reviews are quite interesting-- all of these reviewers seem to have forgotten that this is a COMEDY. It is not a drama. Are some of the characters unrealistic? Absolutely, because it makes it a funnier story. Who really wants to see a movie about the people next door and their problems? Apparently these recent reviewers want exactly that.And yes there is some nudity in this movie and some humor about pornography (and even some jokes about using drugs), so if that type of stuff offends you, just don't watch the movie.Way better than 4 Weddings and a Funeral.	5.0	Already a classic	2004-06-28	0	0	0

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	ANSWOG3NY79MO	Jade	"LOVE ACTUALLY is supposed to be a warm and fuzzy film that shows us the glorious, magical, mysterious ways that love appears in all of our lives.  It fails.  After watching the movie twice, I have yet to see a single instance of ""love"" actually appear in the movie.  Told in a series of nine or ten alternating subplots, each storyline only gets a few minutes of screentime at a time and just when you things start to get remotely compelling, it switches to another subplot.  The end result of this is that none of the storylines are very well developed and none of the characters are developed at all.  Characterization is pretty much the most important thing to me about any work of fiction, and it was impossible for me to like this movie since I never got to know any of the twenty-odd main characters and didn't give a crap what happened to any of them.I will say that I am normally a sucker for romantic comedies, which is what made this movie so disappointing to me.  What's wonderful about romantic comedies (normally) is all the buildup, the wonderful sexual tension that builds until you almost can't take it, the nuances and how the relationship slowly evolves...and when you're trying to cram nine full stories into 135 minutes, that just can't happen.  But you also can't just skip all this, head straight for the climax, and expect anyone to care about your characters or believe that they've fallen in love.  The storyline and characters end up all being sort of intertwined with one another in this bizarre six-degrees-of-separation kind of way (just in time for the holidays, of course), but unlike the way this is done in CRASH, which feels authentic and poignant, LOVE ACTUALLY just feels forced and contrived.I suspect that this movie would be easily improved by cutting out half of the storylines and developing the other half, but it's not a sure thing because the majority of the storylines aren't stories of love to begin with; they're stories of lust, obsession, and infatuation.  Are we supposed to be moved by Keira Knightley's stalker, for example?  The last time *I* found out that someone was filming me without my knowledge, I thought it was creepy, not cute.  But that's just me.If you're looking for love, try another movie.  Unfortunately, throwing a bunch of big name actors into a room and pretending it's a romantic comedy just doesn't fly.  There's nothing romantic about this one."	1.0	Lust Actually	2007-09-11	39	20	19

Some material could have been deleted from the movie (like some of the swearing and the scene between the body doubles) but you have to remember this is English humor. It is funny, but it wouldn't be for a 12 year old.  The different stories are all woven together to make a good movie.

This ensemble comedy features some of my favorite actors, and they all seem to be in top form in this feel good film which features &quot;love&quot; - romantic, platonic, unrequited, fulfilled, unspoken, impossible and even filial.Colin Firth is fantastic and sexy as the cuckolded husband who runs off to France to escape his sorrows, and discovers a cure for a broken heart. Hugh Grant is a riot as England's bachelor Prime Minister whose mind wanders every time the teagirl enters his office. His middle-aged sister, played by Emma Thompson, is fearful her husband, (Alan Rickman), is having an affair with his vamp of a secretary. Laura Linney is a lovelorn employee of Rickman's, who just can't get it together to make a commitment. Liam Neeson is struggling to get a grip after the recent death of his wife and finds himself distracted by his delightful stepson's shenanigans. Bill Nighy is hilarious as an over-the-hill rock star who is re-releasing a song for the Christmas season and hopes it will hit Number One on the charts.Director Richard Curtis, (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones' Diary), is an expert at putting together this kind of movie and he is certainly at his best with &quot;Love Actually.&quot; I held off seeing this film while it was in the theaters, and even after it hit Blockbuster. I was fearful I would expire from an overdose of fluff and saccharine. I finally broke down...and, what a surprise!

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2WSCMGYIMGVEY	"Jason Nieuwoudt ""Jason"""	Let me begin by saying that there are some great actors appearing in this. Maybe that in itself is part of the problem!!! I mean Colin Firth and a love interest would have been sufficient, just as Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson would have been. I know that the director, Richard Curtis, wanted to show the complexities and subtleties of love and he needed a large canvas to do this, but really, this is too much. The mix and mash of stories does pull on the heart strings on occasion but there are too many pieces and the plot is disjointed as a result!!! It also requires that you suspend your disbelief, BIG TIME. I mean some of the situations (Hugh's prime minister and his plot) are just too over the top to be anything other than nauseatingly sweet!!! I was persuaded to go and see this by my girlfriend,( she had seen it once already!!!) and was hoping for a great , modern British comedy, along the lines of BJD. Alas this falls far short of the mark!!Numerous subplots are also left unresolved and there seems to a lot missing, unexplainably!!! All in all, I suppose it is worth sitting through just once, but I wouldn't want this near my DVD collection. There are far better and more intelligent comedies out there!!!!

The ""bad"" girl secretary is actually wearing devil horns as part of a costume in one scene--sheesh, how juvenile and obvious can you get? Are these the same minds that created the other brilliant, touching, biting movies that I loved?

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AX298Q56WX6XB	jcarol99	It has been months since I last watched this movie. Emma Thompson's performance comes first to mind whenever think of it now, and I think of it often. When she stood in the bedroom, distraught, wiping tears from her face, wondering if her husband was unfaithful, I cry too. She stood there silently, in one spot, wiping her tears with the palms and backs of her hands--as if she expected this episode of distress to be brief. The simple gesture that she made of smoothing out the bed covers while trying to recover was just perfect. Joni Michell's background music seems to have been written especially for this scene. Whenever I see Laura Linney now, in any other role, I immediately like her, even before recognizing her, because I carry over a love for her character in this movie. She plays a sister who is so maternal in her relationship with her institutionalized brother that her own love affair is affected by his unstable demands, reflecting on the possibility of her own mental insecurity, while also purveying the strength of true family love. And wait until you see Rodrigo Santoro! Beauty personified, and great acting, too. The young Brit with the fantasy of going to America to find a girl who will love him despite his shortcomings is just so funny. Liam Neeson's character's dying wife jokingly told him that he could marry Claudia Shiffer after her death, and it is interesting how that foretelling plays out, though I had difficulty believing his stepson's behavior following his mothers death. There are so many delightful components of this movie. Many types of love--romantic, platonic, maternal, etc.--are presented in both humorous and poignant ways. Seemingly disparate situations are connected in various ways. Colin Firth is wonderful and his romantic affair is storybook perfect; Hugh Grant as Prime Minister is surprisingly believable and politically satisfying. The story of the newly married couple and the secret of the groom's best friend is so beautiful and poignant. Wonderful.	5.0	Actually Love this Movie	2007-09-18	5	2	3

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A16FQMU1M3TWX8	J.D. Guinness	"Love Actually is an endlessly watchable Christmas treat.  Conceived as a series of loosely connected vignettes (the characters all know each other, to a degree) in the manner of Robert Altman's Nashville, Love Actually takes the theme of love and explores it in scenes alternately hilarious and heartbreaking, with some startling originality and rarely any missteps.The standout is probably Bill Nighy's turn as an aging,  Keith Richards-type rocker aiming for one more hit record, but Hugh Grant is notable too for giving one of his most likable performances ever as an all-too human Prime Minister falling for his new personal assistant.  Then there's Emma Thompson, who gives one of the all-time best performances I've ever seen as the cruelly treated wife of Alan (Harry Potter's Snape) Rickman.  Watch Thompson in the scene where she's alone in her bedroom, steeling herself to go out to a school Christmas concert with her family; a master class in film acting!Less effective is Laura Linney in a story about a frustrated office romance; Linney never seems truly connected to the character or her lines, in contrast to her smooth boss Rickman, who can take the most mundane lines and actions and wallow in then with all kinds of ""actor-ish"" nuance, ""biz"", and innuendo (Watch how he chews the scenery while advising Linney on her love life) and somehow never seem false!  Maybe it's Rickman's Snape-like cool that does it!One or two of the plots are just plain silly, particularly Kris Marshall's ""American Girls"" fantasy, as is Martin Freeman's uproarious meet-cute with Joanna Page (Must be seen to be believed!).  But they're meant to be just fun relief between the more serious bits (Linney's, or Liam Neeson's grieving widower scenes).  Sometimes it's the smallest details that get the biggest laughs; watch how Kris Marshall (as ""sex-god"" Colin Frisell), standing in Arrivals at Heathrow Airport, actually steals a scene from beautiful Shannon Elizabeth with a knowing look to his buddy!  Marvellous.Writer-director Richard Curtis got his start in British TV with such shows as Mr. Bean and Black Adder and then the hit film Four Weddings and A Funeral.  As in Four Weddings, Love Actually is by no means perfect, BUT it has more than enough great scenes, so generously stuffed with some of Britain's finest character actors, truly too numerous to mention, to make you smile, if not laugh, all the way through.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1US682RYFRY7C	Jeff Hanks	"Love Actually is a cunning, interesting, and tear-jerking film about 8 so-so couples flirting with the concept of love in every single way possible. There will be ""awww""s and there will be ""whoaa""s, but in the end, there will be silence. Have you ever actually watched the entirity of the end credits roll? You will now. Not because you want to see the names of the people who portrayed the people who swept you off your feet, but because you will be so far off your feet you can't even reach the remote.8 different love stories. It's like taking 8 romance movies and condensing them into 2 hours of film. And I know what you're thinking... And it's not sloppy. The writers pause each sub-plot at a minor cliff-hanger and move on to the next one. It's fun, it's charming, it's love. It teaches you about the importance of not letting something (or someone) go without telling them what's in your heart.So watch it. Follow along with these people, these people in search of love, these people losing love, and these people trying to hold onto it. An actor and actress being filmed in explicit situations with each other exchange conversations as if they were in a coffee shop, each secretely hoping to make their on-screen love a reality. England's rookie Prime Minister falls head-over-heels for his catering secretary, a pleasantly plump, clumsy, cussing woman, so he must decide over his job or his secret. A man and woman who have children, but there's a little note inside their heads saying the marriage is falling apart. Possibly because of the man's secret crush-ish on his secretary. Two co-workers who have been dancing around each other for years, it's all up to who makes the first move. A widow who is coping with the loss of his wife, while his elementary step-son is in love with a schoolmate of his, gives his step-son advice and insight on love, even though it may very well be the father who is learning something. (Next is my personal favorite) A man who moves to France to write after his wife cheats on him, and hires a Portugese maid, while speaking different languages and no understanding of the other, they conjure crushes for each other, and they obviously don't know how the other one feels. A couple has just married, but the man's best friend has been in love with the wife since they've met, this is something many males can relate to. An old rocker who falls back in love with music and attempts to recreate a good relationship with his manager while trying to get the #1 christmas hit. And finally, the good old-fashioned American viewpoint on 'love', a barely-legal man who is desperate for sex moves to America where he hopes to score.As I said, this film covers ever concept of love, whether condescending or illicit, they're all there. The topics of affairs, office crushes, crush-on-best-friend's-girl, choosing between love and current career, child crushes, love being a universal language, and women being used as sex symbols rather than soulmates are all evident in this film.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2UN0VXFXDPL9A	Jennie	This is not your typical romantic comedy. This movie encompasses the different aspects of love and relationships that we all have and treasure in our lives- the love we have for our romantic partners, for our children, for our friends, and even for people who have taken us completely by surprise when we realize how much they mean to us. It portrays several different relationships all interwoven into one cohesive story, and when you are done watching it you just feel.... warm and fuzzy. It's also wickedly funny. A great story that can be enjoyed by anyone... though I wouldn't show it to children because there is nudity.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3FZATWZ7AG2DE	"Jeremy Lynch ""Mysterlynch"""	Richard Curtis has proven, in the past, that he has an eye and ear for the tender moments that make up the better part of humanity. In his directorial debut, he has delivered a movie shows the very best in people. In it's weakest moments, Love Actually was entertaining. In it's best, it was moving and capable of touching your soul. I really didn't see a weak performance in the bunch. I did feel the use of music was a bit overdone, particularly towards the end. Curtis delivers such fine dialogue, he should have let it carry the finale rather than pop music. All in all, Love Actually is a fantastic movie that shines because of the wonderful performances by an incredible cast that was given a great script.	5.0	Strong script, stellar cast.	2004-11-09	7	7	0

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AZ515FFZ7I2P7	Jerry Jackson Jr.	"I saw this movie in the theater with my wife on Valentine's Day back in 2004 and bought it on DVD for her (and me) on Valentine's Day 2005. Like most heterosexual men I am NOT a huge fan of romantic comedies. I think most of these films are ""chick flicks"" that aren't worth the waste of time to see. Love Actually is so funny and heartfelt with great characters that I actually WANT to see it again and again. Too bad all ""chick flicks"" can't be like this.As for the several people who wrote negative reviews about the brief moments of nudity in this film ... this film is CLEARLY meant for an adult audience and is rated R. What kind of R-rated adult romantic comedy doesn't have a few curse words and quick flashes of breasts? The only romantic comedies I've seen that didn't were rated PG or PG-13 ... and those are exactly the kind of ""chick flicks"" I hate. I'm not saying this movie needed the boobshots or the harsh language ... the film probably would have worked just as well without it. I will say that the language and the moments of nudity help make this film a bit more ""honest"" in terms of its view of adult relationships."	5.0	Possibly the best romantic comedy for husbands and wives	2005-03-03	12	8	4
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1F73AP2UUAVMR	Jesse Kincy	"Love Actually is, by far, my favorite romantic comedy of all time.The power of the previous statement is limited by both the qualifying term ""romantic comedy"" and the fact that I'm not typically a fan of the genre.  So, a skeptical reader might (correctly) surmise that ""Love Actually is, by far, my favorite romantic comedy of all time"" isn't quite the proclamation of towering praise it initially seems to be.  Okay, fair enough.Love Actually is in my top 10 favorite films of all time; I've watched it at least twice a year since it was released; it is my VERY favorite holiday film, and I've purchased 17 copies of the DVD over the years.Better?The movie is just plain good.  Sappy in places?  Sure.  But there's enough variety here that just about any viewer is going to find something to like.  There is a pretty absurd amount of star power here, and most of them deliver really solid performances.  There is no shortage of laugh-out-loud scenes, and while the movie offers more than a few moments that will tug at your heartstrings, this film is (thank God) not a tear-jerker.Love Actually is a true ensemble film.  It doesn't really follow a single plot.  Instead, it follows more than a dozen different people through individual storylines that turn out to be (loosely in most cases) intertwined.  They range from the completely silly to the more-sad-than-funny, and all of them are played out against a Holiday Season backdrop in London.I've watched this movie with lots of different people over the years, and I can't think of a more ringing endorsement than the number of copies of the DVD I've given as gifts to those same people (after their reaction to the first viewing)."	5.0	"A ""Chick Flick"" for Everyone"	2013-08-04	1	1	0
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2EBLL2OYEQJN9	Jessica Lux	I was a bit apprehensive about watching a movie with a series of disjoined storylines, but Love Actually revealed itself to be a masterful film with storylines that interconnected on literal and metaphorical levels.  A viewer can't help but be sucked into these storylines, brilliant acted by the cast of Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Kiera Knightley, Rowan Atkinson in a delicious cameo, and others.The soundtrack beautifully integrated the different scenes of this movie.  An external sound-over (background music) from one scene would transition into sound-in (music playing in the scene) in the next segment.This movie explores all different types of love--fragile relationships, people that magically fell together, relationships being constructed piece by piece, unrequited love, glorious crushes, the pursuit of physical satisfaction, and more.  This is a testament to all the different forms of love, from the joyous to the mundane to the painful.	5.0	Brilliant, intertwined narratives to be enjoyed on many different levels	2005-12-27	3	2	1

Rick ""bricoleur, hobbit"""	This is the kind of movie that's fun to watch as long as you are not going to analyze it for depth later. Yes, it's sachrine--the ending is artificially sweet. But, it's thoroughly enjoyable.For me, the most-notable and weirdest thing about the movie is the lack of consistency. Is this reality or fantasy? Some of the stories seem grounded in reality. The relationship between Thompson and Rickman's characters, for example. Others are pure fantasy, such as the gorgeous available women in midwestern bars just waiting for a Brit to show up. That both of these storylines make it into the same movie (and end at the same location) is just weird.	4.0	Fun, sachrine, weird	2005-07-29	7	3	4

For the first time in my life I felt lucky to be a smoker, as it allowed me to gasp for breath and leave the theater a few times.Why there were talented actors in this syrupy, ludicrous and stomach turning piece of bile is beyond my comprehension.  I can only rationalize it this way: Hugh Grant needed money for another prostitute, Billy Bob Thornton was on something, and Liam Neeson thought it was a parody of a romance film.Did The Blair Witch Project scare you?

That said, his vein of humour - gentle for the most part, with alternating bouts of sentimentality and vulgarity - is an acquired taste.Anyone who found sitting through Notting Hill or Bridget Jones a bit of a struggle might want to pass on Love, Actually. This is Curtis in extremis, from the ""love is all around"" mantra to the bumbling Hugh Grant character, the big musical numbers to the Christmas setting.There are no less than eight stories on offer, running the gamut from schoolboy infatuation to full-on marital infidelity. Some of the plots are a hoot: I defy anyone, for instance, not to enjoy washed-up rocker Billy Mack's (Bill Nighy) quest for Christmas Number One. There are some strong performances, too - Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are particularly good as an estranged married couple.Elsewhere, though, Curtis's preference for quantity over quality gets a bit irritating. The central romance, between Grant's bumbling prime minister and Martine McCutcheon's tea lady, could happily fill a whole movie. The fact that it's given so little screen time here just robs the characters' final declarations of love of any meaning. Curtis may have intended to create a towering monument to the glories of l'amour, but instead he often ends up reducing ""I love you"" to a banal platitude.Still, as an entertaining bit of fluff, this just about succeeds. Fans of Curtis's previous work, and anyone of a diehard romantic bent, will probably find much to enjoy here."	3.0	Flawed, but watchable enough	2004-08-06	3	2	1

While it's funny on an absurd, titillating level, the graphic nature of the scenes means that I don't feel comfortable sharing this movie with friends or family and that's a shame. I initially saw the movie in a packed theater and was shocked and embarrassed when these scenes appeared.It's a sweet movie otherwise and has the potential of becoming a perennial holiday favorite.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AIE25P25286KD	"J. Johnston ""Jeff Johnston"""	"If 90 minutes of playful, self-conscious humor of romantic comedies presses all the right buttons for you, does it follow that two hours or so of the same playful, self-conscious humor will appeal to you even more? No, it turns out, it doesn't necessarily. If there were one thing I'd suggest to someone before even renting this movie, it might be to remind them simply that a movie is a good chunk of time out of your life which you won't be getting back; choose accordingly. This does NOT mean you shouldn't watch ""Love Actually"", but I WOULD like to draw a distinction between fluff and non-fluff romantic comedy, and the fact that ""Love Actually"" certainly falls into the latter category. How can one say it? A movie like ""Sleepless in Seattle"", there you watch it because you know all the plot, acting etc. is all basically manipulated so that your heartstrings will get pulled, but clandestinely. You know THAT ahead of time. In ""Love Actually"", on the other hand, it's like you're supposed to fill that void yourself - I mean specifically the one where the emotional and dramatic elements should be (to be yet more blunt, the elements that make us care about the characters. Any sense of plot or conflict serves only as a scaffolding for the situation comedy and warm and/or fuzzy moments which, after all, make up the ostensible, visual substance of films in this genre. ""Sleepless in Seattle"" had those moments, but it had a lot underneath; this movie however defintely has a residual nature to it. (I should say ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is one of only two or three other romantic comedies I think I've ever seen, but I'm pretty sure it bears the role of archetypal romantic comedy pretty well).The positive points: I'll never understand this, but Hugh Grant is ALWAYS funny. He plays the Prime Minister of GB. In one scene (after the President of the US, played by Billy Bob Thornton in yet another inexplicable cameo, has sexually harassed his secretary), he tells a throng of reporters that Britain ""shall not give in"" or something to America's interests. It's completely out of left field and completely implausible, but it's just great. Meanwhile, said secretary (I don't remember who she was played by, there're about 20 characters) has enough beauty and sweetness to stock the whole of the movie; jokes are made throughout about her weight yet she is consistently the most interesting and convincing female character...which is another positive point. If you don't like one storyline, it won't be too long before the perspective shifts.The main negative point of course is what I already alluded to, namely, that NONE of the characters really gets developed. There's just too many of them, and even with the two hours (hence why ""LA"" is sure to wear out many welcomes) you end up not feeling like you've really seen anything of them. But again, if all you're after is diversion, ""Love Actually"" has a great atmosphere to it and, admittedly, a few pleasant examples of post-90s situation comedy."	3.0	A comparison	2004-03-07	0	0	0

None of the characters were ever on scene long enough for me to develop any empathy toward them, none of them were drawn with the slightest bit of realism or depth (except for maybe the washed-up singer), and none of the situations were the slightest bit believable.The entire sequence with the &quot;prime minister&quot; meeting the &quot;president&quot; was utterly pointless and added nothing to the movie.  But then, that pretty much describes every other scene so I guess it fit right in.Like &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral,&quot; this movie was pointless, meandering, unfocused drivel and a complete waste of film.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1DSL771CZ7QV3	"John Conner ""Let's make music"""	"After a series of slapstick Christmas comedies over the past several years, LOVE ACTUALLY may be the ideal modern Christmas story.  The reality of love may not be any more tangible than the meaning of Christmas, but the various incarnations of love that are portrayed perfectly in Richard Curtis' star-studded film, are heartwarming yet grittily sophisticated enough to leave the viewer without visions of sugarplum affairs. While this movie could be watched at any time of year, for me it will become a perennial Yuletide event along with Miracle on 34th Street, It's a Wonderful Life, White Christmas and, A Christmas Carol.The theme that runs throughout the story is communication, or the lack thereof.  The secret admirer uses cue cards, and another learns to speak a Portuguese.  There are chalkboard notes, drum sets, and hopes of second chances.  There is body language and silence, plus loads of misunderstandings communicated by people who need people.Sure LOVE ACTUALLY contains mature themes and perhaps deserves an ""R"" rating, but then love actually does.  And for how long now have adults been waiting for a Christmas story intended solely for adults?  Not wishing to take anything away from the traditional holiday films, I welcome a film with the complexity to match the season.Whether you believe in love or not, this movie reminds us that there are people who do."	5.0	Great Acting, Great Stories, Great Fun	2005-11-30	5	4	1

Like ""The Christmas Story"", it's a staple on my Christmas viewing list.The movie follows several little love stories which collectively make the actual story about love itself.  Although not overly developed or unpredictable, each story is touching, funny, witty, and sincere.  The acting is excellent, and the pacing never lets you get bored.  The only reason I can think that you'd not enjoy this film is if you don't like the dry, wry British sense of humor, don't like ""chick flicks"", or don't like some of the actors.As for the technical aspects of the Blu-Ray transfer, I know nothing.  Although I have an HDTV, I couldn't tell you if the transfer is great or not.  I listen to everything on headphones (apartment living), so I wouldn't be able to tell you about the sound quality.

The reason ""political"" is being levelled at the film is one of its plots involving the British Prime Minister and the President of the United States.  It couldn't be taken as a serious political gesture, because...1.  The President is played by Billy Bob Thornton.2.  That means he's more like Bill Clinton than George W. Bush.3.  If you don't believe that, the allegory is that POTUS is a womanizer.  More like Clinton, or more like Bush?4.  The movie was completed before Britain joined the U.S. in Iraq.5.  Hugh Grant plays the P.M.  Can anyone see Grant as Tony Blair??Well, anyway, there are a few brilliant moments in an unfortunate sea of sentimentality.  This could have been a really great, memorable film if only a smidgen more care had been invested in its writing.  If you check your common sense at the door, though (let me say that again:  Hugh Grant pccupies Winston Churchill's chair - capish?), it can be fun."	3.0	"""Political"" Is Relative"	2004-10-10	7	2	5

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1P2NBM3P3TS2X	"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason"""	"Generally I really like the film scripts that Richard Curtis has written.  This one is no exception, but in this film, his directorial debut (I think), he ups the ""sappy"" quotient a few notches too high.A few examples:  the musicians rising up from the pews after the wedding ceremony to add musical accompaniment to the Beatles song, Liam Neeson's kid learning the drums practically overnight to win the affections of the most popular girl in school (whose singing in the film looks more like another pop-music video than anything else), and several other hokey sentimental moments that add too much saccharine to the proceedings.  On paper those moments are okay, but the way they are shot cinematically cheapens the film.Good moments abound too, however:  Emma Thompson's Christmas Eve realization that her husband Alan Rickman is unfaithful leads to an acting moment that ranks with Thompson's best work, and the sweetly romantic scene where Colin Firth clumsily proposes in another language to Lucia Moniz.There are too many good things about this movie to write it off as a sappy piece of fluff, but there are too many sappy moments in this film that compromise the ""structural integrity"" of the script.DVD bonus features are what we've come to expect nowadays:  Commentary and another little feature or two.Worth watching?  Oh yes.  Worth buying to watch over and over?  Depends if you're diabetic and have a tolerance for sugary sappiness."	3.0	Funny, sweet, but WAY too sappy far too often	2004-11-10	5	3	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AGH5RJDNL7TAZ	"John Stodder ""a.k.a. Juan La Princi"""	&quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; is great.  &quot;Notting Hill&quot; is basically enjoyable.  But this movie is basically terrible, though a few great performances and funny moments enliven it.  It follows the format of some of the cheesiest romantic anthology shows of the 1970s like &quot;Love American Style&quot; and &quot;The Love Boat,&quot; interweaving improbable, and therefore quite sappy, love stories together, in which the characters generally have only incidental or coincidental relationships with one another -- i.e. the final group of scenes at a children's Christmas pageant and at an airport gate, where all the characters happen to be together.  The outcome of each little story is almost entirely predictable from the first scene or two in which the characters and situations are introduced.  Probably this is true because they give each tale so little time, any detours into surprise would cause this bland souffle to collapse.The two stars are for the one truly excellent performance here, Emma Thompson's.  She was ubiquitous for a few years, but she's pulled back, so it now feels like a rare pleasure to see her work in a domestic story like this.  I also enjoyed the burned out rock star's story.  If you happen to catch this on cable, those two pieces will give you pleasure.  The rest will make you feel like you ate too much cotton candy.	2.0	Anyone remember &quot;Love, American Style&quot;?	2004-05-03	11	6	5

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2BUBR32UHE6NF	jojo	I guess the point of this movie was supposed to be Love Overload, sending women into an overdose of estrogen with every romantic turn.  Any one of these plots might have made an interesting movie, but each is chopped down into something about as substantial as a 30-second commercial.  Most romantic movies only ask you to endure one or two cheesy gimmicks, but by the time I saw a marriage proposal accepted between two people who barely knew each other at all, I had reached the end of my rope, and I realized that none of this was anything like real romance.Without disdain, I can advise that if you're into the cutesy shmaltzy stuff then you may love this movie.

Intertwining characters and story lines, plus it's strong overall theme, made this movie almost perfect.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A26Q9WXGPHGQOY	Joseph Barrows	"This film is flat out determined to rub the old fashioned minded among us raw with its ""anything goes"", cameo soaked take on love.  In their desire to point out the fact that love is happening all around us everyday the producers chose to take the low road and indulged in a decidedly relativistic view of morality and ethics.  Scenes run the gambit from thought provoking vinets to the suddenly perverted and bizzarre.  Declaring this 2hr hodge-podge ""Love Actually"" is akin to declaring a birthing video ""Parenthood Actually"".  I think most of us would agree that love goes far deeper than sexual impulses and emotional highs.  After about 1hr of bewilderment we ended up fast forwarding through the key scenes just to find out why everyone gave this little gem 4 stars.  We found nothing which redeemed its $3 rental cost. Save your $3!  Instead, take your special someone our for a coffee and reaffirm your commitment to them, write them some poetry or thank them for being who they are in your life.  Unless your a cameo junkie or enjoy having your sensibilities accosted every half an hour this film is a vacuous waste of your time."	1.0	Love actually...is anything goes?	2013-01-05	11	4	7

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1TKM36EYEQNSM	Joseph J. Slevin	I enjoyed the concept of this movie and the cast was just tremendous.I felt it was like watching the British All-Stars.  All of the acting they did was outstanding, yet the movie troubled me.It was Love Actually, actually it was more about dysfunctional lives and relationships.The warm part of the movie and the potential starts and ends with those at the airport, the mosiac of loved ones hugging one another and a reference to 9-11 and the question is there still love in the world.  This is the most touching piece of filmography I can remember.  With Hugh Grant narrating as people come up hugging and crying and laughing, you witness love, actually.There are some great moments in this movie with some great twists.I felt the down side though was that there was too much flirtation with cheating, dicussing sex to a young child that was way beyond his years, fairly graphic shots of a couple progressively 'practicing' sex scenes for lighting.  If just this last one was eliminated the movie could be a classic because there are dysfunctions in life.  Yet I felt there were too many that did not really show the love, actually, shown at the airport.It is a good movie for couples to discuss relationships and where they see themselves.  There are some cute relationships and some neat twists, yet it is not for everyone.	4.0	Really a 3 and a Half - Great Cast and Casting	2004-03-03	4	2	2
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3SV72ZAHH2IDH	"Josephll ""Reformed Music Addict"""	"This movie was on TV yesterday so I decided to watch it, I thought it would be another cute romantic Hugh Grant comedy like ""About A boy"" ""Notting Hill"" or ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" But so wrong I was, this movie was neither charming or remotely fun, it was just silly, confusing and unrealistic.First of all it's too confusing and messy, there are simply too many charachters in the movie but too few that we really get to know. Instead of having 3 or 4 great couples that fall in love we have 9 or 10 undeveloped charachters that we barely know and fall in love with each other for whatever reason we don't know. I wouldn't call it LOVE actually, since it seems like in many of the occasions it's barely lust or sex instead of actual love that they feel. A PM falling in love with a woman on his office? A guy falling in love with his housekeeper? 2 porn actors falling in love? come on!.What bugs me most is that it's too unrealistic, it's not that people fall in love at first sight in reality and it's not that everyone actually get it together just because of it. Hugh Grant plays the British PM here (When hell freezes over) and Billy Bob Thornton as the US president. Grant complains to Thornton that he's tired of being USA's knee dogs, and the dumb US president Thornton tries to get busy with Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) when Grant enters at the right moment to stop it. Then we have this man that falls in love with his Portuguese housekeeper. Since when did Portuguese women work as housekeeper for British guys? Come in Portugal is no longer Europe's poorest country, they have no need to do so. They can't speak the same language but STILL they fall in love for whatever reason. When she leaves for Portugal he's still in love and takes a Portuguese course and flies to Portugal to propose. Her dad and everyone else seems so happy that the fabolous Brit is coming to save her from the poor and miserable life in Portugal and he's welcomed with open arms. His portuguese went from non-existant to above average in what? 2 months?, Then we have this kid that is 11 years old that fall in love with a girl at school that is American. He's too shy to tell her that and eventually when she's going home his dad get a idea to follow them to the airport. Unfortunately she's already entered the passport check but his dad get's the brilliant plan to run through the passport check and the security area to tell her his feelings. It's just not possible! even if you're 11 and very small. This scene was even more unrealistic then ""American Ninja"". Then we have another scene with this British loser that can't get women in England so he goes to USA, where he get's 4! The US women are as dumb as they could be and (prejudices, prejudices) and ready for sex the first day just cause the guy had a funny accent.In the last scene of the movie there is this airport scene where everyone is meeting up with everyone. And I don't see why? Is there any logic in that scene at all. For some reason the director wanted everyone entangled with everyone and it just get's too confusing. I actually did like the idea of this movie, but it should have had stronger characters and more ""real love"" then lust and silly moments. It would have been nice to see 4 couples instead of 10 that we got to know, and understand why they fell in love and how they felt. This movie is a big mess, neither charming or romantic like Grant movies normally are. Richard Curtis didn't make it at all with this messy concept."	1.0	Not Much Love Actually	2005-05-07	48	20	28

There is a lot of nudity and it undermines the film, that is why it loses a star in the rating. It is beyond most R rated films in both language and nudity.It is a series of storylines about new relationships that in many cases are good enough to have stood alone and some that should have been cut from the movie altogether.What works is the overall concept and if you can get past all the nudity (mind you, if you are a fan of nudity there wont be nearly enough for you here) you have a funny and moving look at relationships.The story of the father (Liam Neeson) and son is outstanding; Hugh Grant's Prime Minister story is charming; Colin Firth's story is nice; the story of a singer and his manager is funny and Emma Thompson breaks your heart. The musical score is great.Aside from the fact that you should not see it with your kids or your Mum, it's quite good actually.	4.0	Flashes of Brilliance and Flashers Actually	2003-11-02	31	22	9

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1W67810BRQSDO	"J'Ro ""The Only One"""	"Love Actually is a movie comprised of vignettes. It is basically a story about men, their loves, their losses.  The step-father who has lost his wife and his step-son who has lost his mother and who is also in love for the first time.  The cuckolded husband, the poor drip who can't get laid, the married man pursued by his ammoral secretary, the new prime minister infatuated with his employee, the man secretly in love with his best friend's girl, the porn body-double who is very much a gentleman, and the aged ex-heroin addict ex-pop star.  And then there is the poignant addition of the woman who is doomed to suffer unrequieted love.The movie is fast paced and the editing of the various vignettes form an interwoven story that is funny, sad and entertaining.  Hugh Grant's dance scene and Colin Firth's childish tantrum on the sidewalk when he can't get a taxi are hilarious.  It's always charming to watch grown men act like little boys!This movie isn't for children due to mimed sex scenes and naked female breasts.In my opinion, the one vignette that stole the entire movie is the one about the aged ex-heroin addict ex-pop star staring Bill Nighy.  They could have made an entire movie about this character.  Most of the laughs are generated by this character as he tries to make a half-hearted come-back with a remake cover of an old song called ""Love is All Around.""  I usually don't find older men attractive but Bill Nighy is so wonderfully weird, strange and clever in his role, that I couldn't help but find him a little bit sexy as the burned out old pop star trying to market his pathetic ""turd"" of a Christmas song.This isn't Shakespeare, it's just pure, goofy fun.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1LVZOK9F7K4CN	JR Pinto	"Anyone who says Love Actually is too saccharine is simply missing the point.  As it makes perfectly clear in the beginning, the premise of this movie is that ""love actually is all around.""  Nowadays, cynicism is too often confused with wisdom, and ""independent"" movies that go for the cheap ""unhappy"" ending are really just cheating the audience.  In the movie, as in life, the characters care about being happy and are ready to put in the work to achieve happiness.There are a lot of stories going on here, so we never delve that deeply into any one of the characters.  It may be simply an over-ambitious plot exercise, but I think it succeeds more than it fails.  I sat through the movie with a dopey grin on my face and I was never bored.  The only story-line that didn't pan out for me was the one concerning Laura Linney - but I won't spoil it.This is a sweet, funny, life-affirming film and very entertaining."	4.0	Very entertaining...	2004-01-14	6	2	4

You follow the lives as such people as the Prime Minister, a famous old Singer, and a english man hoping to get laid in America.  I really loved this movie and it is one of most favorite movies.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3INMIZIYJ9BQ4	"Judi Fryer ""Judi,  Entertainment-glutton"""	After anticipating this film for months, I only saw it yesterday, well after the release date.  Some scheduling conflicts slowed me down, but some not-so-hot reviews made me less than in a hurry anyway.I am glad I didn't put too much stock in those negative reviews, because I loved this movie.  Forget that it could be construed as somewhat anti-American, that it has many multiple plot lines, that it doesn't have a deep, ponderous story line, and/or that it has a sprinkling of sex (gasp), or even that some viewers have deemed it superficial.  It is full of love and laughter.  There are some great lines and the audience does a lot of laughing.This is one very, very enjoyable film set around the Christmas holidays and filled with simultaneous intertwined stories that are all about love.  All kinds of love, from every perspective.  The cast of 100's is wonderful without exception.  Thomas Sangster (Sam) gives a lovable, flawless performance as the step-son of recently widowed Liam Neeson (Daniel).  You can't help falling in love with the child.  Billy Nighy (Billy Mack), who was great in 'Blow Dry' will blow you away with his performance of an aging rock star trying to push his recording of 'Christmas Is All Around' to #1.  Alan Rickman once again gives a stand-out portrayal in a small role, because he simply can't ever turn in any other kind.The music in the film is an excellent backdrop for the various tales of love. Hugh Grant's choreography to 'Jump (For My Love)' is reminiscent of Tom Cruise's frisky dancin' in 'Risky Business', except Grant is portraying the Prime Minister of England rather than a teenager, has all his clothes on - not just his underwear, is several decades older, and is ever so much hotter than Tom!As for the sex some reviewers keeps talking about - well, after all, it's a fact of life, sex and love do go together.  It is interesting and refreshing to see the differences in the on/off screen personas of skin-flick actors when appearing in their films and when falling in love off camera.  Just another aspect of love.One little warning, if you don't currently have a love in your life-this film can sometimes get to you just a little. The film does such a superb job at showing the viewer all those 'little things' that are so much a wonderful part of love.  Those moments can catch one off guard and make one somewhat winsome. But don't let that keep you away from the theater, love is actually all around anyway so it is difficult to get away from it even in the real world.This part is for fans of Billy Bob Thornton.  I have not seen one photo of Billy Bob in this character.  I was especially anxious to see BB as President.  As would be expected, he looks GREEEAAAT!  I am not going to discuss the character of his role, the negative or the positive of it, nor speculate how/why he selected this role.  I will say that even in this small cameo it is so easy to see the undeniably excellent talent of Thornton.  He has the bearing; in body, demeanor, facial expressions, the whole nine-yards, of a president, and he pulls it off, as with every other role, with seeming ease.  Ladies, he is so good looking as the leader of the U.S., he will take your breath away.  WoW.  His few minutes of screen time will definitely be worth the price of admission to Billy Bob fans.  To all else it is just another bright moment in a sparking holiday love story.'Love Actually' is a feel good movie that actually makes you feel good, makes you smile, cry, laugh, and care, really care about the characters, and it reminds us why we all actually love love.	5.0	You Will Actually Love 'Love Actually'	2003-12-14	14	12	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3QEPSZ62L6BU5	Julius Weber	This movie definitely captures your attention but is otherwise badly done. Try to sleep through most of it. One weakness is the large number of characters and you will find some difficulty in working out who they all are (or how they know one another). Hugh Grant is a disaster as Prime Minister and his infatuation with his secretary, and fight with the US President over her, is too bad to be even rated as farce. Colin Firth is believable as is Bill Nighy but I cannot imagine who wrote Emma Thompson's lines. Writer Richard Curtis has done better things. One feels that most of the actors just turned up for the day to do their parts and left; it's all rather disjointed. Rowan Atkinson does his best but he is obviously just there to help sell the film as is Liam Neeson (who came to the studio with that perpetually bored expression of his).The ideal drink to help enjoy this movie is a good sedative.	3.0	Fun but bad	2013-02-22	0	0	0

""Love Actually"" is the greatest romantic comedy movie that I've ever seen. The film was made just before 2003 Christmas in U.K. by Richard Curtis and the story is also about some couples' happening around Christmas.In the start of the movie, it shows us many people's hugging at an airport and Hugh Grant who is the movie's main character voices that ""Love actually is all around."" and the movie starts showing us how the love is all around. You should know that this film is not about just one couple's story. There are several couples' story but the stories are not separated. They are organized partially.The movie has two kinds of version; the original and the asian. The asian version movie doesn't have the story of love between porn actor and actress. I have an unsatisfied of this.I strongly recommend people who want to feel love or make love to watch this movie, but if you don't have any person who you can meet, it may make you sadder because the couples who are in the film look so happy.Plus cameos' acting makes the movie more interesting."	4.0	If You Want to Feel Love...	2005-08-02	5	2	3

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AFRZL05D54MPM	JWolf	"The 2003 British romantic comedy, ""Love Actually,"" is a compilation of about ten different storylines depicting various experiences with the emotion known as love.  The characters/various storylines cross paths at different points in the movie (generally somewhere in London) by a similar manner as that seen in ""Crash,"" ""Alpha Dog,"" ""Valentine's Day,"" and ""New Year's Eve.""  Despite receiving mixed reviews, film is reported to have grossed about $247,272,278 in the worldwide box office (The-numbers.com).  The movie's soundtrack gained unique recognition in the top 40 of the U.S. ""Billboard200,"" reaching #2 on Top Soundtracks (some of the tracks vary between U.S. and U.K. editions).  Romantic comedies are not my favorite, but this movie is on my top-10 list for the genre because I think it shows a more ""real"" take on love.""Love Actually"" was both written and directed by Richard Curtis.  Starring roles include:  Hugh Grant as David, Colin Firth as Jamie, Emma Thompson as Karen, Liam Neeson as Daniel, Alan Rickman as Harry, Keira Knightley as Juliet, Billy Bob Thorton as U.S. President, Laura Linney as Sarah, Martine McCutcheon as Natalie, Gregor Fisher as Joe, Martin Freeman as John, Olivia Olson as Joanna, January Jones as Jeannie, Bill Nighy as Billy Mack, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Peter, Andrew Lincoln as Mark, Lucia Moniz as Aurelia, and Thomas Sangster as Sam.SUMMARY:  The movie begins with an introduction from David, the British Prime Minister, commenting on the various forms of love and how in the direst of moments, we choose to express love and not hate.The ""Old Friends"" Kind of Love:  In the spirit of the season, past-his-prime rock star Billy Mack is recording a cover of ""Love Is All Around"" with the assistance of his longtime friend and producer, Joe.  Though the rendition gains instant popularity for Mack, he seems to realize the frivolousness of spending the rest of his life chasing the fame he once knew; Mack sets his ambitions aside in order to spend the holiday with Joe, his beloved friend.The ""Forsaken"" Kind of Love:  Harry, while married to Karen, attempts to play the game of secret girlfriend with his secretary, Mia.  Due the salesman's (Rufus) elaborate gift-wrapping, Harry confuses which Christmas present goes to Karen and which goes to Mia.  Because Karen is consumed with preparing her children, Bernard and Daisy, for their school's Christmas pageant, she initially believes the necklace intended for Mia is actually for her.  A combination of Harry's nervousness and Karen's insight lead to the truth.The ""First Crush"" Kind of Love:  Following the passing of Daniel's wife, Daniel becomes the sole parent to Sam.  Daniel, who often confides in his close friend, Karen) sets out to tighten his bond with his stepson and learns that Sam has developed a crush on his classmate, Joanna.  Daniel advises Sam on how to Joanna's affection by convincing him to accompany her performance in their school's nativity play.The ""Dream-Come-True"" Kind of Love:  Natalie, a member of the newly elected Prime Minister's household staff, is in charge of serving David's tea and biscuits.  Their regular exchanges result in a growing chemistry between the two, which is partly responsible for David's disgusted reaction after witnessing Natalie being sexually harassed by the visiting U.S. President.  Following this exchange, David and Natalie become distant.  When he reads her Christmas card, he sets out to find her and escorts her to his niece and nephew's (Daisy and Bernard) nativity play.  For a moment, the stars align to make David and Natalie into the play's grand finale.The ""Broken Road"" Kind of Love:  When Jamie discovers that his girlfriend has missed her cue as `plus-one' for Peter and Juliet's wedding because she is having an affair with his brother, Jamie retreats to a small villa in France to focus on his writing.  Though Aurelia (the housekeeper for the cottage) does not speak English, she and Jamie learn to communicate in other ways and form a friendship with an understanding for one another that requires few words. Upon his return to England, it dawns on Jamie that he has fallen in love with Aurelia so he takes it upon himself to study her primary language, Portuguese.  When Jamie goes back to propose to Aurelia, her answer lets him know it was meant to be.The ""Unconditional"" Kind of Love:  Sarah, a friend of Jamie, has long been infatuated with Karl, her coworker.  For a moment, Sarah seems to have a chance to act on her feelings for Karl, but she forgoes this opportunity so that she can be with her brother who needs her more.The ""Adore From Afar"" Kind of Love:  Mark, the Best Man for Peter and Juliet's wedding, gives Juliet the impression that he is unfond of her and her marriage to Peter.  When the wedding video doesn't meet Juliet's expectations, she seeks out Mark in hopes that the footage he took will be better.  While watching Mark's video, Juliet sees that his focus is entirely on her and realizes that she had misinterpreted Mark's disregard as distaste, but it is actually that he loves her.  Juliet is confused about why Mark had never told her his feelings.  Mark later answers this question in a scene that I believe to be the best of the movie, so I won't spoil it.The ""Time To Fish A New Pond"" Kind of Love:  Colin believes that his strikeouts with women (which seems to culminate at Peter and Juliet's wedding) are due to a `stuck-up' nature of British women.  Colin sets out for Milwaukee and finds love with new roommates Stacey, Carol-Ann, Jeannie, and Harriet, all of whom swoon for his exotic accent.The ""Shy"" Kind of Love:  Despite being comfortable as nude body doubles for a sex-themed movie, John and Judy are nervous with one another off-set.  They accompany one another to watch the school Christmas play with John's brother."	4.0	Love, Actually, Is A Lot Of Different Things	2013-10-27	1	1	0
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2SARNTK8O6PL4	K. Alphs	"This movie reminds me of the British comedy ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", except this story takes place in the weeks leading up to Christmas. The movie is actually several stories which are intertwined with each other. Hugh Grant plays the newly appointed Prime Minister who falls for a female member of his staff. I love the part where Hugh dances to the Pointer Sisters song ""Jump"". Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are a couple whose marriage is on the rocks. Liam Neeson is a recent widower with a young son who is lovesick for a girl in his class. Colin Firth looses his girlfriend to his brother but finds his true love while he is away on holiday. Kiera Knightly is a newly wed who finds out her husbands best friend is in love with her. Billy Bob Thorton makes his appearance of the president of the United States reminiscent of Bill Clinton. Bill Nighy portrays an aged rock and roller attempting his comeback with the song ""Christmas Is All Around."" The movie is full of British wit and humor.

In this ensemble effort, he is in just a few scenes, playing the Prime Minister of England who is inexplicably attracted to a foul-mouthed female assistant.  If that's not enough, there's a couple starring in a porn film who are too shy to even kiss on their first date.  I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that this movie can't decide if it's concentrating on its R rating or trying to be a feel-good movie.  It tries to do both and doesn't succeed very well in either effort.	2.0	Not enough Hugh	2004-06-13	8	1	7

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3CF7B2U0IB8PS	Katie	"I am a big fan of chick flicks; they aren't necessarily films that I buy and watch on my own time, but if one's on TV I'll watch certain parts of it or the whole thing.  I think that they're just nice, feel-good movies to watch.  I enjoyed this movie when I first saw it, though I thought it was very flawed.  Then, not too long after I got home, these flaws kept digging into me and finally I realized exactly how crappy of a movie it really was.I'm going to echo what other people are saying about the September 11 thing.  Umm, here's the thing... this movie isn't American, it's English.  You can't claim this tragedy for yourselves.  No matter how much empathy you feel for the USA, it's just not the same.  If the film had been set in America, showing how love went on in America after 9-11, that would have been a lot more appropriate.I'm going to echo what everyone else said and say that most of the storylines absolutely sucked; they were vapid and had very little character/relationship development.  The only storylines that I cared about, like Emma Thompson's and Laura Linney's, were very inconclusive.  The storylines that did have happy conclusions were ones that I really didn't care about at all.I have a MAJOR problem with the blatant America-bashing in this movie as well.  Did no one else seem to care that the Prime Minister of England broke his alliance with the USA because the American President was macking on a SINGLE woman, who just happened to coincidentally be the PM's love interest?  WTF?  And the English people are HAPPY about it!  So in celebration of his selfish and rash decision to which for some reason no one seems to object, Hugh Grant dances. Great.  Also, he was the most unbelievable PM I've ever seen.Oh, and this is the one that really made me mad... the English guy who goes to America to meet hot American chicks and shacks up with some hot co-eds.  Where does he go?  Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  If you cannot tell from my location info, I am from WI.  If you walk into a bar here, even in Milwaukee, you are not likely to find sexy southern chicks who invite you to room with them.  You ARE likely to find drunk middle-aged men watching a Packers game.  I saw this movie with my friend, and we all thought that the kid was dreaming it up.  Imagine our surprise when we found out that we were actually supposed to believe that could happen.  Um, yeah, right.The other stories were just dumb.  How many dashing to different countries/airport scenes can one movie take?  Just one is unbelievable enough.  Frankly, I don't care about any of the stories, aside from those two.  And those two were unresolved.  Absolutely wonderful.  They should take those two stories and make movies about them... cut out the rest of this tripe.  Even those storylines had major problems.  Like Alan Rickman's secretary.  She's presented as a slut that you're just supposed to hate.  Great character development right there!I've been to England and whatever country I saw in that movie did not seem like it.  The only thing they had going was the lingo (which, IMO they seemed to lay on thick just for us, the American audience who is like ""Hehehe, they said ""blimey""!  I love English people!) and the accents.  It's a shame, because I really like London and would really have liked to love this movie.  I tried, I really did.Really, they would have been better off focusing on two or three stories.  Sixteen is entirely too much.  Each story felt detached; I can't even remember the characters' names.  Also, I did not appreciate the cheat shots at America.  From what I've seen of reviews at this site, even non-Americans were offended."	1.0	Blech	2005-04-14	35	15	20

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2KPHIZ2JO0VWS	"K. D. Crapsey ""justkimberly"""	"I was in a very blue mood, in need of a pick up, when I went to see this movie, all by myself mind you. I thought it was one of the best romantic comedies of recent years. It will surely be the sleeper that ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""When Harry Met Sally"" were. I didn't go to it based on the writer/director's previous works because I thought ""Notting Hill"" was one of the most boring movies of the century. But, it seemed like a feel-good movie, and that is what I needed.Some say that the number of story lines, characters was too much, but I disagree. Each brought their own special tone to the movie. Even the porn stand-ins. I know a lot of people thought the nudity was unnecessary, and uncalled for, but, in my opion, it was simply trying to emphasize that even in such rediculous situations, love can be found. And the idea of the couple who have seen each other naked, imitated sex, were so sweet and innocent, timid in their coupling as when John shyly attempts to kiss Judy, was very sweet, in my opionion. Yes, the scenes were a bit much, but, I think they worked for the movie, and it is rated R after all.The one scene that I initially resisted was that of Colin Firth's character Jamie falling for his maid, who didn't speak English. At first, I thought how rediculous, they don't really know each other. Then I realized something in the opening scenes of their relationship when she jumped into the water to retrieve his papers. It was that scene that made me realize how he had fallen for her, and how that was a possibility given his past experience of being cheated on. This woman, who barely new him, was sensitive enough to chase after his rediculous manuscript, in cold waters, that is love.Their were several jabs at Americans that *almost* turned me away from the movie. First, the jab of the Prime Minister at the US President (Hugh and Billy Bob). Sure, it probably was meant to come across as the PM putting the US Pres in his place over his handling of the assistant, but in reality, lets face it, it was a political jab at the US. I know the Brits may be upset at their own PM for his handling of recent events, and as polls show, so are the vast majority of Americans, but this movie was not the appropriate place for such comments.The second jab at Americans was when the less than gorgeous Colin was able to come to the states, Wisconsin at that, and immediately get 3-4 girls to bed him? Just because he had a British accent? What do non-Americans think of us American women?! I know few women who would do the same. Of course, he did find them in a bar, but even so, it really makes me wonder what the Brits think about us American women.I do think that more time could have been given to some characters, such as we never really know if Harry (Alan Rickman) bedded his secretary, but, overall, I thought it was a poignant movie with a great reflection of love. And it may have seemed like some of the ""love"" was forced, since after all this was just a 5 week period, but I thought it was all appropriately encountered.I think one of the best played out seens was that of the hysterical (yeah, he almost stole the movie) scene of Billy Mack with his manager. At first you think it is going to turn into a gay thing, but then you realize that it wasn't. It was instead a man who realizes that he does indeed love his manager, who has put up with him for so many years, and stood by him through the thick and the thin. The embodiment of a good friendship, and a man admitting his love for another man. That almost brought tears to my eyes.And finally, the real scene stealer, Miss Olivia Olson as the American Joanna who has stolen the heart of Liam Neeson's character Daniel's step-son Sam. The movie was worth the 6$ (matinee) just to hear her rendition of ""All I want for Christmas."" I had to immediately go to Wal_mart when I realized the soundtrack was out. That little girl can SING!So, if you just need a feel-good movie, can tolerate a little bit of nudity, (ok, a lot of it in some scenes) and can handle a little bit of US bashing (it is a film made by the Brits after all), then I highly recommend this movie. Don't let the political undertone ruin it for you. Just stick to the ""Love Actually"" portion of the movie to see that Love is actually everywhere, from the newly found romance of the PM, to the love of a 10 year old school boy, to the love of a man and his longtime friend and manager, to the love of a sister for her mentally ill brother. I walked away feeling both happiness and sadness. How is that for a movie?Go see it and judge it for yourself. :-)"	5.0	Love Actually is wonderful, despite the political undertone.	2003-11-15	99	51	48

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1OBJ2263JCK5	Kenneth M. Gelwasser	"In the first moments of Richard Curtis' wonderfull film comedy, ""Love Actually"", we see the words ""Love actually is all around"" appear prominently on the screen. And for the next two hours and fifteen minutes, that is exactly the theme, that Mr.Curtis, the Master of British romantic comedies (""Notting Hill"", ""Bridget Jone's Diary"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral""), goes back to, over and over again. During the course of the movie, we follow the concurrent stories of more than a half dozen different couples as they deal with romance, during the Christmas season in London. They include a young women, who is in love with her office coworker, a widower and his stepson, who is suffering from 'puppy love', an older married couple, who are on the edge of infidelity, a pair of newlyweds & a best friend, a writer and his Portugese house keeper, a young guy lusting after American girls, a couple working as stand-ins for an 'Adult Film' production, and the young British Prime Minister, who has fallen in love with his office's 'Tea Girl'. All these interactively connected stories are framed by a foul mouthed, 'over the hill', rock star and his overweight manager, who are hilariously attempting to get a crass, holiday single to #1 in the charts by Christmas Eve. Sounds like a lot? Well, yes it is. Writer/Director, Richard Curtis has stuffed a lot of plot into this film, attempting only somewhat successfully in making sure each story has a tidy ending at Heathrow Airport. Many of the plotlines are pretty corny with some implausible situations (Yeah, right...the Prime Minister of Britain is knocking on doors in the middle of the night looking for a girl!) But you know what? We don't care! The characters are so likable and they so sweep us away with the romance of the situations, that we suspend our disbelief and sit back and enjoy the movie. Curtis shows us how love can be both joyous and painful. It is a messy emotion, that needs a lot of hard work. But in the end it all seems to be worth the trouble. Love really is all around! The excellent large cast of the movie features some of the 'cream of the crop' of the British film industry. They include actors such as Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Keira Knightly, Rowan Atkinson ETC. These folks plus many more are all pretty much outstanding in their performances. My personal favorite was actor, Bill Nighy's portrayle of the decrepit rock star, who's wickedly funny comments leave everyone's jaws on the floor during his publicity tour (""Hey kids! Don't buy drugs. Become a pop star and you'll get them for free!""). Finally, mention should be made of the movie's beautiful photography from Cinematographer, Michael Coulter. The film is a love letter to London in much the same way Manhattan appears in Woody Allen's movies. It is a glossy romantic look, that adds to the romance of the characters and their situations. The DVD of this film is quite well done. The picture and sound are crystal clear. The DVD is chock full of extras including over a half hours worth of deleated scenes (with introductions), that are quite interesting. Furthmore there is an excellent commentary track between Richard Curtis and some of the film's actors, which has verbal sparring, that is just as funny as anything in the movie! Its' pretty obvious, that Curtis and Actor, Hugh Grant are old friends. The good natured, but mockingly sarcastic comments, that the two made, when ever Actor, Colin Firth appeared on screen, had me laughing my head off! Definitely make sure to play that commentary track!! For an evening of wonderful romantic comedy, I highly recomend the film, ""Love Actually""."	4.0	"""I'm Going to Wisconsin!!"""	2004-11-22	10	9	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2WO89WQPZ8S1Y	KerinSM	"What can I say about one of my favorite movies?The whole movie is comprised of several different love stories and scenarios each handling the idea of love and relationships in their own way. Each tie together in the end while referencing back to the opening scene. None of the relationships or connections seem contrived or forced even though some of the time the heartwarming cheese gets to you. It always does this in a seemlessly classy way though.Also, the scene changovers and music choices are beautiful, each song gently tugs at your heart strings and emphasizes the movie's message.The commentary that you can choose in the bonus material is also really interesting to listen to as you get another perspective from the directors and actors in the movie. I know that this seems very much like a ""chick flick"", but please give this movie a chance.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A30TK6U7DNS82R	Kevin Killian	Both! Nothing says Christmas to me like Love Actually, with its all important children&#8217;s Christmas pageant, and its race to find out which pop star will land the coveted Christmas #1, and Rowan Atkinson at the jewelry counter creating an extravagant paper turkey of a wrapped present. This time however watching it at Christmas on Wednesday, I noticed for the first time all the many gibes about fat people that writer director Richard Curtis puts in just about everywhere. I guess you&#8217;d call it a Leitmotif! With its ten storylines, there&#8217;s room for all sorts of social commentary. It&#8217;s a two hours and fifteen minutes movie, the longest romcom ever, but if you took out the anti-fat jokes and agitprop, it would be maybe one hundred minutes tops.The movie begins with Bill Nighy&#8217;s worn=out rock star Billy Mack trying to remember the new lyrics to &#8220;Christmas is All Around,&#8221; watched over by his seen-it-all, tolerant to a fault manager Joe, who stays with him even though he&#8217;s a joke to everyone else in the show. We all love this story because we like watching an underdog come back, nd right away we see the fattest person in the movie, as though to clue us in, this is going to be a picture in which people&#8217;s physical frailties are going to be relentlessly mocked.In succeeding scenes we see normal sized people being dismissed by the skinny as too fat, and even the thin ones are fretting about their weight. Perhaps a seasonal touch for when the holidays come we all have to worry about rich food. But Love Actually gets nasty, particularly when Hugh Grant, as prime minister David, meets his new assistant Natalie, from the wrong side of the tracks, and instantly the chief of staff apologizes to David for saddling him with a fat assistant. Martine McCutcheon isn&#8217;t violently slim like Kate Moss, but she&#8217;s attractive (in a weird way, almost as though she didn&#8217;t have enough features in her face) and she dresses in red often, as though to show she&#8217;s spirited and full of life, the way we know Maureen Stapleton embodies life in Woody Allen&#8217;s Interiors, whereas Geraldine Page embodies death, since Stepleton wears scarlet and Page beige. Anyhow it takes Hugh Grant a long time to work out how he feels about Martine McCutcheon because of the social opprobrium she creates wherever she treads. If she was so scandalously fat, I wondered, how did she get the job of handing out the chocolate biscuits anyhow, at Number Ten Downing Street, which seems like a foul place in this movie. Except for that one large pre-Raphaelite painting in the hall.Okay then, same thing happens to Alan Rickman, attracted to Mia at his office amd yet saddled with Karen and her fondness for Joni Mitchell who taught her how to feel. I didn&#8217;t really think Emma Thompson was fat either, but Richard Curtis gives her this scene where she has to try to wriggle into a dress that&#8217;s too small for her now, though once she fit into it handily when she was Mia&#8217;s age and wore a size zero. It&#8217;s a complicated role that Emma Thompson doesn't make any easier by not having gained weight for the part. She&#8217;s a thin woman who&#8217;s acting as though she&#8217;s too large to fit into a dress&#8212;extraordinary work, yet watching this scene I wonder how well it reflects ordinary society of today where if you&#8217;re just a little bit heavy you&#8217;re cast into perdition, and have things gotten better in the past ten years, when Love Actually was filmed? I doubt it. Today, Martine McCutcheon would not be giving out Scotch to the US president and wearing red, she&#8217;d be in jail.And the anti-fat theme even reaches out to beyond the borders of the UK, as Colin Firth, in love with a thin Portuguese waitress, learns her language and comes unannounced at Christmastime to ask her father for her &#34;hands in marriage,&#34; and the father calls for his daughter and it's not Aurelia at all, but Sophia, the fat one! She's not only fat but mean and jealous and plain. Even Aurelia fears gaining weight and becoming like Sophia. Sophia gets some good laughs in her final moments, but it's pretty gross of Richard Curtis to play the fat card one more time just when you thought it was going to be a feel good ending.	4.0	Christmas classic or anti-fat diatribe?	2013-12-27	11	10	1

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	"Love Actually brings the audience a bright glance of what most people on earth strive to encounter and/or attain, love. Love is a word with many different meanings in regards to the relationship between people, but it is uniformly positive to how people interact to one another. Love in this film is most often meant as how the Merriam-Webster dictionary would put it: ""1 a (1) : a strong affection for another arising out of kinship or personal ties (2) : attraction based on sexual desire : affection and tenderness felt by lovers (3) : affection based on admiration, benevolence, or common interests b : an assurance of love.""The film displays several characters that are linked to one another in some way and how these people find a love connection with each other. The story emphasizes that time and place are irrelevant and that no one is above love as the story depicts the British prime minister (Hugh Grant) falling in love with one of his maids. The story also shows the first love as a young teen falls in love with the school's popular girl, and how love sometimes can be painful when it is not returned.Richard Curtis who also directed films such as Bridget Jones Diary and Four Weddings and a Funeral has previously displayed his skill in making romantic comedies. Love Actually continues to presents Curtis's skill to make light hearted, yet meaningful films where love is the essence. In addition, it is a film that will cheer up the audience while viewing it as it offers much humor, entertainment, noble notions, and much else to ponder. In essence Love Actually offers what it teaches, love, which provides an excellent cinematic experience."	5.0	In essence Love Actually offers what it teaches, love...	2004-09-24	7	3	4

But then I read an interview where Colin Firth said that the movie studio had to send him an advanced copy of the commentary to make sure he wouldn't sue -- because Hugh Grant made disparaging remarks about him throughout the commentary.  Sure enough, Hugh slags off his ""rival"" at every opportunity, snoring when Colin's scenes come on, calling him old and fat, and mocking his wardrobe.  But it's all done in fun -- and Hugh makes fun of himself as well.  Writer/director Richard Curtis, the little boy from the film, and the aging rock star also contribute great comments and much laughter (the other actors are seeing the film for the first time while doing the commentary).  Definitely one of the most informal and charming roundtable discussions I've ever heard on a commentary track.

Kraus ""mskraus2u"""	Being an anglophile, I had to see this movie set in England with my favorite British stars, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant.  It did not disappoint!  It is such a nice story about love in all its forms.  Several individual stories are going on at the same time, and the writer does a nice job of linking them to each other.  One story, about a widowed father trying to bond with his son, is particularly heartwarming.  The young son is going through his own heart troubles, having fallen in love with the most popular girl at school.  Another minor storyline is about a couple of actors whose job it is to stand in for porn stars while the director is setting up the shot.  This story is, in my opinion, the only thing that keeps this movie from being appropriate for the whole family.  All the actors are superb, and the story is excellent.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2GPEV42IO41CI	Kona	Love Actually is a sparkling Christmas comedy about eight couples and the love in their lives.  Hugh Grant stars as the newly-elected British Prime Minister, who falls in love with his unsophisticated secretary.  The wonderful Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman play a bored couple whose marriage is on the rocks.  Handsome Colin Firth plays a writer working in France who is attracted to his Portuguese assistant, who doesn't speak English.  Bill Nighy nearly steals the show as an outrageously flamboyant  middle-aged ex-rock star who has a new hit.All of the actors are excellent in their roles.  Hugh Grant is my favorite, playing his usual, adorable, Prince Charming role to perfection.  Thompson and Rickman are compelling as spouses who have lost the spark, at least for each other.  The script is solidly funny, and poignant as well. (Note:  Bring your hankie.)The film would have been better if it had concentrated on just  three couples.  One of the unnecessary stories deals with a couple in the porn business, and there is a great deal of nudity.  For this reason, I think the film should be rated NC-17.  But it is a real feel-good movie and a genuinely funny comedy that will leave you smiling through your tears.	5.0	Very adult comedy about Love	2003-11-14	5	2	3

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AN0XWUHSHRUG6	Kristi Ahlers	I have actually liked all of Richard Curtis' movies.  This one though has been my favorite.  This movie offers several different story lines with some of today's most talented actors.Colin Firth finds love with a girl that dosen't understand English, and he can't speak Portuguese but that doesn't stand in their way.  Hugh Grant is the PM of England and finds love with one of his members of household.  Can a PM find love at Christmas time?  Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are a married couple that is truly tested by a possible affaire.  Laura Linney finds love with a co-worker but has family responsiblities that play a large part in whether the relationship will work.  Liam Neeson is a stepfather that finds himself helping his stepson who is experiencing love for the very first time.This is a very heartwarming movie demonstrating that love can be found anywhere, at anytime, for anyone!

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AC06F0LPHI1TW	K Scheffler	"Love is a word/concept that has been trivialized in our post-modernist era, and this movie for the most part well documents the superficial and sometimes perverted behaviour now deemed to be ""love"".  Still the movie is humorous at times and also explores the sometimes negative consequences when ""love"" is the basis for deception and betrayal.  Unfortunately the down side to this movie is the for some unwanted unexpected surprises in terms of subject matter and nudity.  On the surface the movie looks like a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy but alas two of the characters who ""fall in love"" happen to meet while fully nude stand-ins for a porn movie.  Other questionable nudity leaves me wondering while, still, female actors are required to expose their boobs for a few brief moments as though this is actually essential to make the movie work.  Also the somewhat open dialogue involving the kid--especially in one of the deleted scenes--is a little problematic in my books.  In the end it could be said that there is much more in the way of lust and infatuation than love in this movie."	2.0	Not actually about love...	2011-05-11	7	4	3

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3P21DSBG74K7U	"Kurt Hargis ""crummywatertower"""	I never saw a trailer for Love Actually when it came out.  A friend of mine gave me the DVD thinking I would like it.  Looking at the cast, I figured it couldn't be bad.  I then watched it.  I called six friends after to tell them they have to watch this movie if they hadn't seen it.  It explores all kinds of love, from make believe to young love to shattered love to the loss of love.  And everything else in between.Richard Curtis does a great job with script and the handling of his actors.  The only fault I can find is that I liked these characters so much (even the ones that do stupid things) that you wish he wrote a screenplay for just each individual storyline.  It is rare that I find myself wondering about what happens to characters when they are not on screen.  I enjoyed these characters as real friends and I was interested in them so much I wanted to know more.The acting is top notch.  Hugh Grant is totally believable as the Prime Minister.  He brings a real person charm to a role that could have been dictated by the circumstances in which he is placed.  Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, who act so often together, make there relationship so real it is palpable.  Thompson and Grant have a charming little scene in which she defines the real definition of a desperate housewife.  Keira Knightly is absolutely lights up the screen.  She is also an actor who knows how not to give too much away.  She has a perfect scene in which someone who she thinks hates her really does in fact love her.  She doesn't overplay it all and actually waits longer than most actresses would have waited to show her emotions.  There is another seen in which she could have gave away the ending of her storyline, but she plays it in such a way that even Grant and Curtis disagree about what happens to her character after the movie is over.  Laura Linney and Colin Firth are there usually excellent selves.  However, the best acting in my opinion goes to Liam Neeson.  His story is the loss of the love of his life.  He doesn't make it weepy but sticks to smaller things like just endlessly staring at a picture of his wife.  Then, he finds that his step son is in love for the first time.  He doesn't treat his son has a child having a childhood crush but really believes that his stepson is indeed in love.  He has an honest relationship with his step-son, and it is their love that becomes the true love story of their relationship.	5.0	I feel it in my toes	2004-11-19	3	3	0

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1V8GY9ERC5T70	Kyle R. Pierson	"I can almost guarantee that LOVE ACTUALLY is not the movie you think it is.  Although the creators also brought us FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, NOTTING HILL, and BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY, you still may be a little shocked by the material showcased in their latest flick.  The film is comprised of numerous short stories that are all connected to each other at various degrees.  Hugh Grant is featured in his short as the new English Prime Minister who has fallen in love with his assistant.  Liam Neeson plays a widower who must come to terms with his young stepson, a child actor you will definitely see again.  Alan Rickman portrays a married man who is seduced by one of his co-workers.  You get the picture.  Each story shows love in a different light.  Unfortunately, although this is a very funny and moving movie, I felt like the film should have concentrated more on some of the key stories and left out some of the others.  For example, three older ladies in the theatre I attended got up and walked out.  Their complaint was valid.  There is one story that deals with an actor and actress in the porn industry too shy to ask each other out on a date.  Funny stuff, but there is excessive nudity and sexual situations to back up the plot.  Most of which is unnecessary.  However, they were the only three that complained.  Everyone else who left the theatre said that the film was ""very good"" to ""excellent.""  I guess it depends on your own standards.  I enjoyed the film, but would have liked to see some of the stories extended a bit.  Also, for being on the poster, Rowan Atkinson only gets to showcase his comedic talent for roughly five minutes."	3.0	Love, Sex, and Swearing Actually	2003-11-02	78	58	20

Sam, the son of Daniel (Liam Neeson) is fantastic, as is Emma Thompson. You feel her heartache. My favorite is probably Hugh Grant and his Natalie. What a gag she is with a 1000 watt smile. the 'porn' is done in total jest, and anyone who is offended needs to lighten up. It's much ado about nothing. Perfect to see with your honey.

Sometimes that love can be difficult and painful, sometimes it is strange and awkward, other times it is touching and sweet. One of my favorite stories is between a father and his step son, as they build a trusting relationship after the wife and mother - the person who bound them together - has died.All in all, it is a great movie to enjoy with friends and with popcorn.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	I am not sure what the British equivalent of throwing in everything including the kitchen sink would be, but that would certainly apply to the romantic marathon that Richard Curtis has put together for this holiday season.  Curtis has previously written the screenplays for &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; and &quot;Notting Hill,&quot; along with the adaptation of &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary,&quot; along with a slew of &quot;Blackadder&quot; and &quot;Bean&quot; scripts (which explains the choice bits for Rowan Atkinson).  With &quot;Love Actually&quot; (is all around, is the rest of the title we see in the opening credits) Curtis tries his hand as director as well and apparently gives himself permission to work in every idea for a plot that he had come up with recently.  I have seen several descriptions of this film talking about their being eight couples, but there are at least nine plots lines which collide with each other in various ways at various points in the film.  All of them have them moments and it will be interesting for couples who see this film to pick and choose which three story lines they like the best.Curtis sets the range of tone for this film in the first two sequences.  During the title credits Hugh Grant makes a poignant comment about September 11th that evokes an emotional response from many audience members and then we are confronted with the spectacle of over aged rocker Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) turning a familiar song into a holiday exploitation number.  The laughter outweighs the tears in what follows over the next 135 minutes, but there are ample opportunities for both (I had no idea the film was that long, I was too busy enjoying it).  Curtis juggles all the plotlines effortlessly, buoyed by the fact that all of them are interesting and we have a strong rooting interest in several of them as we follow them through the four weeks before Christmas.  However, do not be fooled into thinking that everybody gets a happy ending, because that is not the case, whether they deserve it or not.  Still, there are enough endings to go around (maybe even more than &quot;The Return of the King&quot;), and it is good to remember that sometimes the triumph of love is a peck on the cheek.There seems little reason to review the plot lines, because there are just so many, and no need to tell you which parts were my favorite because you should make up your own mind.  The cast alone should be enough to get your interested in this one.  I commented that it had three of the four leads from &quot;Sense and Sensibility,&quot; only to see the fourth one pop up (sort of).  True, I have trouble believing Hugh Grant is the Prime Minister of England, but that is a minor concern.  Mostly it is the relative newcomers that standout, including Andrew Lincoln as Mark, Martine McCutcheon as Natalie, and Thomas Sangster as Sam.  Another fun part of this film is all the recognizable faces who pop up at interesting moments (you will need the fingers on both hands to count them).  Be forewarned that this is a British comedy, which means naked bodies are usually funny rather than sexy, which is a shame only because there are parts in this film kids would like but their parents will not let them see because of the other parts.  Also, be prepared to stop at a store on the way home to pick up the soundtrack, because the music is a big part of this film and you have to find a way to get Billy Mack's song out of your mind.I can also tell you that my wife laughed louder and cried more often than at any movie we have ever seen.  In fact, I was told I had to get the DVD for her for Christmas, so stick a fork in me, because I am done.  On the other hand, on the other side of the two bridges I can see from our windows is Wisconsin...	5.0	Christmas is the time to be with the people you love	2003-12-13	9	4	5

I had not heard of it previous to this occasion; however, I could not be happier that I did. Not only is the cast stellar, with the talents of Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, and Hugh Grant, but the plot is also one of the most multi-faceted and well-conceived in a film that I have ever seen, with a clever sense of humor that didn't have to try too hard to be funny. This movie captures the essence of relationships between a group of adults of varying ages and stations in life, exploring what really makes love--and life--tick. I walked into the theater expecting to be entertained for two and a half hours, which I was, but I also walked out with a new favorite film.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A307GBR1LD80D1	Leander Dossilea	"I am a very skeptical viewer and can find fault with even the most intricate of plots. What most people love, I find ridiculously flawed.This film, however, which I first saw about 7 years ago, is, among other things, the perfect response to 9/11.The message is undeniable and renewing: love is actually all around us.Is it schmaltzy, weighty, campy, oozy, dumb, corny, and overly ambitious? Yes, it is. So are people, so is life.But this film attempts, as few modern films to, to propose a theory and then go about hamhandedly proving its validity.And it works. A child develops a crush on a young girl who has the same name as his recently deceased mother. He has no awareness of the connection, of his need to heal. He winds up running past security in an AIRPORT to tell her he loves her and goodbye. What a sweet, heartbreaking, heartwarming antidote that moment alone represented to the hatred of the terrorist attacks.And that's just one vignette. There are many others, all of which take us through the nuances and complications of romance and relationships and friendship in ways that are not just amusing but also undeniable genuine and sincere.People who don't like this film are judging it as a film. As such, it is monumentally flawed. As a message of hope and as ""a reminder of all that was once good in the world, and could be again"" it is perfect.At a time when hate seems so obviously prevalent and persistent, what's wrong with a little Christmas counterargument?Let's get pissed and watch porn."	5.0	great film	2013-06-03	0	0	0

The list of top quality actors taking part in this film is very long!  All the actors' performances are outstanding; their great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing a film that can be watched over and over again.The plot is very witty, very well thought through, and fantastically executed.But that is not the only thing that puts this movie at the very top; it combines excellent comedy, realistic drama (for a change), and the music is such an asset (!!!), making this movie one of the best of its kind.After Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral, Richard Curtis has scored another major hit with this movie! In short, Love Actually is a movie guaranteed to make you both laugh and cry, and in the end leave you with the warmest feelings of joy!  I for one would definitely line up to watch a sequel!	5.0	AMAZING!!!	2004-08-01	3	1	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3I59YUOK0GWAL	"Lily ""Random*Oddity"""	Is it hopelessly fluffy? Yes. Is it cheesy in some places? Yes. Is it a bit cliched at times? Yes. But then it is also a wonderfully acted, touching movie.Some people have complained that one of the storylines involves adultery, but I think that that storyline is probably one of the best. The emotions are realistic and very well portrayed, especially by Emma Thompson as the wife.Yes, I think that the romance with the porn stars could have been cut out, but I also feel that you shouldn't forego the whole movie because of that one plot line. If it offends you, skip it. The rest of the movie is definitely worth watching.Not all of the plot lines have the perfect Hollywood ending, either. Some of the people that you want to end up together may not, and I think that that also adds to the realistic quality of this film.There are a lot of plot lines, and it's not the kind of movie that you can follow if you're only half paying attention, but the plot lines flow nicely together, so it's really not that difficult to follow, and all the plot lines are actually interrelated, as you find out through interactions between the various characters.All in all, this is a sweet, feel-good movie. Yes, it's cheesy at times, but at the heart of it, it has a good message: Love really is all around us, in many different forms. And I think that this is a message that everyone needs to hear and remember.	5.0	Love Actually	2004-04-28	0	0	0

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3NLJZI5NEOT0K	"Linda Pagliuco ""katknit"""	This winning film starts out with the premise that, contrary to popular belief, the world is full of love, not hatred. By watching the lives of 8 different pairs of people in London, England, some of the many different types of love are explored. There's platonic, seen in the relationship of an aging rock star and his manager, and puppy love, as a young boy develops a crush on a classmate. There's unrequited, when Mark's best friend marries the woman he wants for himself, and the specter of infidelity, when a husband's eye is caught by his secretary. Throw in a couple of cases of loving from a distance, and a junket to Milwaukee to hook up with some of those hot American girls, and there's all sorts of mistakes and magic going on. The finale, though relying heavily on coincidence, is fascinating as all the main characters are brought together at a school Christmas pageant. No deep philosophy here, just good, engaging entertainment provided by a stellar cast and witty director/writer. A bit too racy for children.	5.0	All kinds of love	2008-04-16	11	7	4

Unfortunately, the result did not live up to my expectations.  The main problem was that there were too many plot lines.  They weren't too difficult to follow, however, and that was the problem.  If separated into their respective stories each plot line couldn't have taken more than 10 or 15 minutes, and you can write a decent story in that amount of time, but not a good story, and certainly not a great one.Because of the title I was expecting the movie to leave me with the warm fuzzies, but most of them left me feeling dissatisfied.  I'm a big Colin Firth fan and I was grateful that at least his story was good.  That saved it from my rating the movie one star.  All in all, I wish I had never seen the movie.  I would have been much happier with my illusion of a good movie.	2.0	Disappointed Actually	2004-10-21	24	10	14

It was funny, romantic, touching, etc., with some really memorable scenes (proposal in the Portuguese restaurant and scene in the airport involving young boy and his first love).The nudity and curse words (including cussing by a young child) was just completely unnecessary.

However, the stories were a bit too unconnected and the push at the end to make them connect was too far a stretch. The overt sexuality was overdone, considering the right audience for the story, or more correctly, stories, is not likely to be the type of audience to appreciate the soft porn. It interferes with the lightness of the movie, pulling the audience from their relaxed dreamy states to one of irritation, and it was all unnecessary.The cast and music were the biggest saving graces of this film. I am curious, though, as to why the profiles of the actors playing Sarah's love interest and Colin's buddy are not mentioned on the film's website."	3.0	Some great scenes but a bit too obscene	2003-11-10	1	0	1

Love between friends, stepfamilies, employers-employees, colleagues etc. are showcased in this film.It shows how love has to overcome various obstacles to survive and thrive. Obstacles of race, culture, language barriers, age, title, class, work, family, and failure are overcome. This film highlights love's obstacles in a light and humorous way.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2G9DGP3L4JGV1	L O'connor	A number of very loosely-connected love stories are woven together in this whimsical romantic comedy.  Hugh Grant plays his usual diffident, dithery character, a Prime Minister who falls in love with his somewhat improbably young and lovely tea lady (I don't know whether you have tea ladies in the States, but in England they tend to resemble Barbara Bush rather than Martine McCutchen).  The funniest scenes involve a very rude ageing rock star making a comeback, and his rather touching friendship with his manager.  Most of the men in the film are so diffident and hesitant they can't get anything done, they can't ask a girl out, or tell her they love her, or even switch off a mobile phone, in fact, they're a bunch of whimps.  Still, the film does have some funny moments, particularly when Hugh Grant goes in search of his tea lady and has to call on every house in the street to find out where she lives.  I would have prefered the film if it had more humour and less sentimentality (there are some scenes involving a widower and his cute young son that really pile on the pathos unrelentingly). It's not as funny as it might be, but it's not bad.	3.0	Christmas romances	2004-06-25	4	3	1

The ""run after the departing girl at the last minute"" cliche was done not once but three times.  The film used old pop music top-forty hits to establish moods in a very heavy-handed, distracting, and unimaginative way.  And, in addition to being insultingly anti-American, the movie was so male-oriented, it was almost misogynistic.  Most of the female leads played paid servile employees of their male lovers.  The women in this film NEVER say ""NO"" to male attentions even if the woman just married someone else.  And female employees flirt with their bosses by turning their office chair towards him and spreading their legs as widely as possible.  This movie has all the subtlety of a pile driver but is far less interesting to watch."	1.0	Tasteless, Actually	2004-10-02	51	22	29

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	ARYI005S7BDWK	L. Paschal	"I netflixed this one last week after a friends comments about getting her Firth-Fix from watching it. It's a delightful film - although I think they could have definitely cut some of the storylines (oh I don't know - maybe the nude movie stand-ins ... that just seemed like a bit too much gratuitous nudity for my taste).Laura Linney's storyline was heart-breaking ... but I wasn't sure how I was supposed to feel about it at the end of the movie? Are we supposed to be ok with her giving up any semblance of a normal life to be at the beck and call of her mentally unstable brother? I don't think it's selfish or heartless to think that you can care for your family, and still have other people in your life.Colin Firth was his normal cute self ... his hilariously worded Portuguese proposal was a high-point in the film.:::: ""Beautiful Aurelia, I've come here with a view of asking you to marriage me. I know I seems an insane person - because I hardly knows you - but sometimes things are so transparency, they don't need evidential proof. And I will inhabit here, or you can inhabit with me in England."" ::::Hugh Grant is the Prime Minister? You mean he isn't portraying a cad? The U.S. President, on the other hand, is portrayed as a total cad.Emma Thompson remains one of the most talented actresses ... she was amazing in the role of the wife of a cheating husband. Her confrontation with Harry at the school play was ... perfectly executed.Rowan Atkinson wrapping the jewelry ... and holding up the airline security for Liam Neeson's son to sneak through ... great casting!I liked how the movie began with Hugh Grant's voice-over about seeing love everywhere ... especially at the arrivals gate at Heathrow. The movie ending in the same place was just bringing the circle around to a nice ending.:::: ""Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think of the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport. General opinion's starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don't see that. It seems to me that love is everywhere. Often it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy, but it's always there - fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. When the planes hit the twin towers, as far as I know none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge - they were all messages of love. And if you look for it, I've got a sneaking suspicion that love actually is all around."" ::::"	4.0	Lovely Film	2004-08-08	5	4	1

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1G2MCGP6V0D9H	"L. Piatkowski ""lpiatk1"""	"This film has a virtual ""Who's Who"" of British actors,all playing different characters that are experiencing the various forms of love and affection.Each story is self-contained, but there still remains a light thread that binds the different vignettes together(some characters overlap at work, friends of friends, etc).The plot is rather simple--5 weeks before Christmas, a sample of upwardly mobile Londoners all falling in/out of love.THe movie tends to drag in places, and the sheer volume of characters does get a bit overwhelming, but there are some brilliant acting moments that smooth over the film's lagging spots.Who steals the film is a toss-up between Bill Nighy and Emma Thompson. Nighy plays a washed-up Rock 'N Roller who's desperately trying to revive his career by making a schmaltzy Christmas record, and then going on a media-publicity storm to promote the hell out of the record. Nighy portrays the singer with enough broadness to make it funny, but still, there is a sense of real humanity in the acting--Nighy still manages to project a character, despite the cartoonish he's presented with.Emma Thompson plays a London housewife, whose marriage with Alan Rickman(amiably sleazy) is on the rocks. Her character is essentially written to breeze in, steal the scene and walk out. Thompson does so with brilliance. She takes the attention away from such luminaries as Rickman, Hugh Grant(portraying her PM-brother) and Liam Neeson(achingly beautiful in a woefully written story about a widower). Thompson's acting reaches a peak in a bedroom scene, in which she releases her grief over her failing marriage. The scene is beautiful in its simplicity, and Thompson knows how to keep the grief real, but not hysterical. The controlling reigned in sadness makes the scene all the more achingly poignant.Neeson's story is rather silly. His widower is trying to console his prepubescent stepson, who is in love with an American girl in his class. Neeson is game, and puts as much conviction and sincerity as he can, but his scenes reek of silliness and contrived humor.Colin Firth's story of a man jilted by his girlfriend, who runs away to France only to fall in love with his maid is pleasant in its straightforwardness. As is Kiera Knightly's scenes as a newly married bride dealing with her husband's resentful best friend.Laura Linney is good in the film, although she has very little to do, and her story, an American woman taking care of her mentally ill brother, rings a tad forced. Also tiresome is the passages with a young horndog (an annoying Kris Marshall) who goes to the US in search for sex.There's some amusing moments with Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister, although his story-line is often stolen by the lovely presence of Martine McCutcheon, who is gorgeous and sexy, as his beautiful secretary.Over all, this film does not ask any deep questions about love. It presents love in the most idealistic way. Thompson and Nighy both offer award-caliber performances, in this above-average mainstream film."	3.0	Overall Good Ensemble Work Elevates Film	2004-01-10	3	1	2

The cast were top rate (Hugh Grant, Colin Firth AND Alan Rickman in one film!) and the director has previously written the hits Four Weddings, Notting Hill & Bridget Jones!  I have to admit though, that to get all the jokes being a Brit (which I am) helps.  The one scene that made me laugh (but no one else in the movie theatre) was the bit when the aged rock star is interviewed by Ant & Deck, two v. famous kids TV presenters.  In the background is a HUGE pic of the pop group Blue, which he defaces with some offensive comments about their manhood! Hilarious!This is one the girls will love (my man wouldn't come with me), and the romance coupled with the Christmas overtones will put you in a good mood for at least a couple of days!SEE IT!	5.0	Feel Good Movie of the YEAR!	2003-11-10	2	0	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AI2G6ZZS0G00Y	Lynne P. Caldwell	What's not to love?  The Director, Richard Curtis has created another winner!  If you love NOTTINGHILL and FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL as I do, you will adore this endearing, light-hearted romantic comedy.  This movie is chock full of Great Britain's greatest and most adorable actors (and let's not forget about Laura Linney from USA).  There are all of my favorites, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth (Mr. Darcy) along with Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman and Rowan Atkinson among others who star in little vignettes about love.I love to go to movies that make me happy.  Imagine going to a film and keeping a smile on your face during the entire time.  Of course there were moments of deep emotions where I (as usual) shed some tears but even these instances turned into deep laughter.I loved all the fairy tale endings in this movie.  All lived happily ever after, no matter how ludicrous the story line was.  Even the story involving Laura Linney was not sad to me because she was making her own choices.  I plan to buy this DVD as soon as it becomes available--4 WEDDINGS AND NOTTINGHILL have been worn out and since I am a hopeless romantic who loves happily ever after endings, I know LOVE, ACTUALLY will get a lot of viewing time!	5.0	LOVE ACTUALLY:  I Actually Loved This Film!	2003-11-22	3	2	1

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	ABV0LTS1INZAW	Mamabear	I expected so much more from this terrific cast, but I was sadly disappointed. The film is severely marred by unnecessary explicitness. For those of us who prefer not to watch porn, we don't appreciate the filmmaker's attempt to insert it here under the guise of a sight gag. It's still offensive. Also disappointing was the storyline with a stepfather and young son constantly talking very explicitly about sex. Beyond inappropriate and utterly depressing.

The biggest problem with this plethora of plots is that most of them are resolved quite poorly, or left unclear. Barely a couple of the stories kept me engaged all the way through, specially since so many of them had such a weird ending.As much expectation as we had for this chick flick, it turned out to be quite dissapointing.

Because if you haven't, you need to...Having reviewed so many 'oldies' transferred to Blu Ray and been elevated fifty-per-cent of the time/disappointed the other half - it's a real delight to report that here is a genuine upgrade from every previous version. Suddenly, the film feels all grown up - the print is incredibly clear - and it adds so much to your enjoyment of the movie. There isn't a part of this rather lovely little gem that 'doesn't' seem improved to me.The extras are the same as the 2003 DVD - Deleted Scenes and Music Of (with introductions from Richard Curtis), Kelly Clarkson and Billy Mack Videos (Billy Mack is Bill Nighy's character), a Feature Length Commentary with Director and Writer Richard Curtis and actors Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy and Thomas Sangster (Neeson's son in the movie). The picture quality for these clips is old actually and hardly high-def, but they are informative and hugely entertaining (especially when the galaxy of stars are talking - Liam Neeson and Laura Linney so enjoying themselves).Apart from being wonderful to look at, you also forget what a great film it is - a huge upbeat pick-me-up of a thing - and hopeful in a way that seems to elude Hollywood stories so much these days. And it's so funny too - Martin Freeman and Joanna Page lying naked on top of each other as the rehearse making out for a skin flick (""Judy this is a real pleasure. It's lovely to find someone I can actually chat to...""), Bill Nighy on the Ant & Dec show ""...kids, here's an important message from your Uncle Bill. Don't buy drugs. Become a pop star and they give you them for free!"" and the ever-hopeful Colin as he embarks for the States to meet girls who will all helplessly fall for his English accent - and they do (title above).So there you have it - great actors, clever intertwining stories, witty dialogue, genuinely funny and touching moments - even sadness and a bit of heartbreak - ""Love Actually"" is a bit of a British gem frankly. And on BLU RAY it's a winner. And cheap too.Recommended like a night in with a saucy minx in Number 10...BLU RAY Credits:VIDEO: 1080p High-Definition Widescreen 2.35:1 aspectAUDIO: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and French, Italian, German, Spanish and Latin American Spanish DTS-Surround 5.1SUBTITLES: English SDH, French, Canadian French, Italian, German, Spanish, Latin American Spanish and DutchPS: for other superb BLU RAY reissues (including full restorations) - see also my reviews for:""The Italian Job"", ""Saturday Night, Sunday Morning"", ""The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner"", ""North By Northwest"", ""Cool Hand Luke"", ""The Dambusters"", ""The Prisoner - The Complete (UK TV) Series In High Definition"", ""Braveheart"", ""Snatch"", ""The Ladykillers"", ""The African Queen"", ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"", ""Back To The Future Trilogy"", ""Brief Encounter"" and ""Kelly's Heroes"""	5.0	"""...I'm On Shag Highway...Heading West!"""	2011-07-29	3	2	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3033Y0GF8QDC1	Mark Borchers	This romantic comedy, featuring an array of the best of British actors and actresses, is very well-made and clever in many places.  I would love to show it to my whole family, but that's not possible. It contains a number of romantic subplots - some heartwarming, some humorous, some poignant - interleaved with what can only be characterized as pornography.The movie honestly troubles me.  I want to watch it with my wife.  Yet, while I know she'd love 90% of it, that 10% which would be completely offensive spoils the whole thing.  If I could convey one message to the producer and director, it would be:  what good is it to make a romantic comedy that couples can't watch in each others' company?I have to recommend the movie.  It's got many good storylines, and a lot of excellent acting.  Sixty seconds of additional editing, and it would have been absolutely exquisite. But don't watch it until you've reread the above paragraphs and concluded that you're broadminded enough to tolerate the tasteless parts.	3.0	What could they have been thinking?	2004-06-29	0	0	0

A jumble of many stories, every one is entertaining, heartwarming, funny, you name it.  A fantastic cast tops it. Please, for those still in the dark, ignore the full screen edition. I have no clue why DVD's are even made in the full format. Listen folks, you do not see the entire picture in full screen!

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A36EW68H08UOCS	"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!"""	"Boy, I wanted to like this movie.  The professional reviewers had prepared me to think that this movie was at the head of it's class when it came to the theater.  Bill Nighy is rightfully praised for stealing the movie and with a cast that includes Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman and Liam Neeson, what could go wrong?For starters there was the ""cute"" idea that a couple who serve as body doubles in a porno movie would actually be shy and have difficulty communicating to each other that they really were attracted to one another in between the times that they were naked and bringing their private parts together.  When the first of these many scenes appeared on the screen a white-haired couple seated in front of the Mrs and myself walked out.  We were not offended enough to leave, but these scenes were unfortunately not particularly engaging or believable either.Then there is the cute notion of the assistant to the Prime Minister of England who is commonly given to firing off language that my mother (and I bet your mother too) would call vulgar, he he, whenever the Prime Minister happens to be just coming in the door.  This is aside from the notion that her character is a full generation younger than he, yet they are *destined* to be together.Has anyone else seen too many ""Romantic Comedies"" that end with one of the characters (usually the female) leaving (usually forever) their male love interest by heading towards an airport, only to have their true love come crashing towards that plane to catch them at the last second?  That cliche was ALREADY too old for me, and to see it trotted out again by having Liam Neeson's pre-pubescent son rushing through the airport after his pre-pubescent sweetie made me groan.Bill Nighy runs away with his scenes, and the sub-plot with Colin Firth and the Italian house girl was fairly satisfying, though predictable.In short - there are some eight or so stories going on here at once, and only about half are believable or interesting, while a few would shock your Mom so badly she'd faint."	3.0	"Not everyone thinks swearing and puppy love is ""cute"""	2004-06-02	18	9	9

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1DBQURAZBR8T	Mark'O	When I first saw Love Actually, i totally loved it. And since my first time, I watched it several times, again and again. In my opinion, it definitely is the most romantic comedy of all times. I usually watch it when I'm feeling a bit down, and I must say it is a great movie for such situations. It features several stories. You have a prime-minister's story (Hugh Grant) who's falls in love with  his house-help girl. Then a story about Brittish guy, who travells to America in order to get American girls who love Brittish accent (also with Elisha Cuthbert). Then about a man who's wife cheated on him, so he went to France and met a Portuguesse girl. Then, a youun boy who's in loved with a girl from school, and his father who is mourning after his wife. Also a story about two co-workers who finally get together, but this doesn't work because she has a sick brother. Next is the story of a married couple and the man starts flirting with his secretary. There's also a story about a couple who has met during filming an erotic movie. And there is also a story about a newlyweds and a guy's friend who is in loved with his wife (Keira Knightley). And all of this stories and characters are somehow connected to others. A great movie overall. If you love romance, you'll love it.	5.0	Fantastic Romantic Comedy!	2004-10-16	9	8	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1DZKOOMMJM1MI	"Mark Twain ""Sam"""	Love Actually is a brilliant film, one of my favorites of 2003. It never fails to leave me smiling, no matter how many times I watch it. It's an energetic, emotional, and funny film, a true romantic masterpiece if there ever was one.Richard Curtis, the genius behind the film adaptation of Bridget Jones's Diary, Notting Hill, and Four Weddings and a Funeral, flawlessly combines 10 wonderful interwining stories, some better than others, but all great. Luckily, the better stories get more screentime and are more fully developed. It all ends quite happily, in one perfect sequence after another. He has assembled an amazing cast, all perfect in their roles, bringing the fantastic script to life. Perhaps 10 different stories is a bit much for some people, but I thought it was wonderfully done.Many people have also expressed their utter disgust at the sex and nudity in the film. Guess what? The film is R-rated for a reason, and the reasons are given under the rating so people won't go into a film and complain about the sexual content. However, as usual, someone always manages to find a reason to whine. It goes to show how close-minded most people are, which is rather tragic considering we're in the 21st Century. Get over it! It's a shame that so many people might not get to see such a terrific film, because of a few scenes with nudity. Tragic, really.As Richard Curtis points out in the commentary, the original cut of the film ran at over 3 and a half hours (a version I am dying to see since even at 2 hrs and 10 mins, I felt the film was too short). However, as an added bonus on an otherwise bare-bones DVD, we get 40 minutes of those deleted scenes with a Richard Curtis introduction. I would have preferred the cut material incorporated back into the film as a viewing option, but for now, this is good enough. Hopefully, a more complete DVD will be released soon.Love Actually is a wonderfully entertaining, emotional, and feel-good film. Everyone will relate to one story or another. As the movie goes to prove, Love Really Is All Around Us, and it's a fabulous feeling indeed. If this movie doesn't leave you smiling, then perhaps nothing will.	5.0	This is a great movie actually	2004-05-20	3	1	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F	mdizzog	The fact is, Love Actually gives viewers quite a few love stories, and it doesn't give the viewer time to connect. What is romantic? Romantic is seeing a couple fall in love, not 3035903509295208 couples talk about love. By the time the viewer may feel any connection to a character, a new story starts and the viewer is lost. I didn't pull one name out of this film and didn't get to connect with one character. Also, the pacing in this film is horrible. Right when a story might seem interesting, a new one starts and a new character is introduced.Love Actually tries to do too many things in a short time. The directing isn't that good and it's only saving grace is Hugh Grant. Also, a lot of the leads have no chemistry whatsoever. They just picked some top-notch stars and expected love. Sorry, but it just doesn't work that way...	1.0	Quantity over Quality...	2004-05-19	32	15	17

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	"I've heard some bad stuff about this movie. The couples aren't given that much screen time etc. But I was surprised, when I sat & watched it, with the wind howling outside, and found myself really enjoying it, and laughing along.Apart from each couple's separate storylines, the movie is also a spot-the-celebrity kinda thing, and there's some surprising cameos in there. Some of the more recognisable cast include: Bill Nighy, Gregor Fisher, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Kris Marshall, Martin Freeman, Andrew Lincoln, Keira Knightley, Hugh Grant, Martine McCutcheon, Laura Linney, Junior Simpson, Alan Rickman, Ant McPartlin, Declan Donnelly, Billy Bob Thornton (playing an almost spot-on US president!), Michael Parkinson, Rowan Atkinson, Elisha Cuthbert, Claudia Schiffer (for her one-minute cameo, she received a reported 200,000), Nancy Sorrell, Shannon Elizabeth, and Denise Richards.My favourite character in all of this was Martin Freeman for definite. I'd only seen him before in the UK show, The Office, but he actually looked really cute in this! His hair was a bit messed up, and he got his kit off! It's amazing, cos he's filming what looks like a very bad porn movie, and they're faking all the positions etc, and him & the girl get together by the end of the movie! The girl also appears topless, which is no doubt to make the guys watch it. Martin is terrific in this movie though.I got quite soppy at the wedding scene with a very blonde and very skinny (b*tch) Keira Knightley. That scene was so romantic and I think I went all gooey inside!The whole scenes between Colin Firth and L&uacute;cia Moniz, are hilarious! There's quite a few subtitles, but they're so funny! The lake that L&uacute;cia and Colin are ""swimming"" in was actually only 18-inches deep and they had to kneel around and pretend to be in deeper water. It was also over-run by mosquitoes and Colin Firth was badly bitten and his elbow swelled up to the size of an avocado, requiring medical attention. This scene is the funniest:[Aurelia jumps into the lake with hardly any clothes on to save Jamie's book]Jamie: Oh God, she's in. And now she'll think I'm a total spaz if I don't go in too.[takes off his sweater]Aurelia: [in Portuguese] [...]. It's cold.[Jamie falls in]Jamie: [...]. It's freezing! [...]Aurelia: [in Portuguese] This stuff better be good.Jamie: It's not worth it you know, this isn't bloody Shakespeare.Aurelia: [in Portuguese] I don't want to drown saving some [...] my grandmother could have written.Jamie: Just stop, stop.Aurelia: [in Portuguese] What kind of idiot doesn't make copies?Jamie: I really must do copies.[beat]Jamie: You know, there'd better not be eels in here. I can't stand eels.Aurelia: [in Portuguese] Try not to disturb the eels.Jamie: [screams in shock because of the eels] Oh God, what the hell is that?Hugh Grant plays virtually the same character he did in Bridget Jones (except he's the prime minister), including calling Margaret Thatcher a ""saucy minx"", and making some little jokes about the person before him, having a scary wife, and horrible children.When David arrives at No. 10 Downing Street, his tie changes 11 times between shots when meeting Natalie. Apparently, Hugh Grant had changed his tie after a post-lunch nap and no one noticed at first. They decided to ""play with it"" and went all out and changed the tie 11 times just for the heck of it.I've seen quite a few reviews, that complain about the ending, but so what if the ending is left hanging? It's the exact same way as life, nothing ever ends perfectly, nor are all the loose ends tied up.What could be done with this movie, is make little spin-offs, and see what happened with all the characters. Of course, then they'd probably be a pile of trash. But there are some of the characters I would like to follow up.Despite the greatness of the movie, it does have its flaws. Why are almost all the women servants or assistants and almost all of the men more powerful (bosses, prime ministers, authors etc)? Women serve lots of coffee in this film! And the more ambition they tend to show (sexual or work-wise), the more villainous they seem. This movie has a very old-fashioned view of the sexes. Why are there no gay couples? With so many couples present, it could have been easily done.I doubt many guys would like to see this movie, and would probably moan right the way through - and not in the way you would like, believe me! This is an outright girly movie, something to spend time cuddled up to your duvet/cuddly toy, with hot chocolate, or having a girly afternoon with your mates. Make your guy watch on the promise of something else later."	4.0	Despite my misgivings, I really liked it	2005-01-06	5	2	3

Since viewing this movie in 2004, I immediately bought it and put it to the top of my Christmas movie stack.  Every Christmas since '04 this is played on DVD.  The English have a way with comedy and satire that cannot be surpassed and this movie will not disappoint you in any way.  The cleverness in which the  individual stories are tied together in the end was just a thrill to watch.  Each actor and story was just, in a nutshell, Well Done All.

All the things that seem to have so many people mesmerized these days.  I can see why some don't like it.  To each his own.  I LOVED LOVED LOVED it!  The all star cast had most of my favorites.  It's just ordinary people going about their ordinary lives, and dealing with ordinary relationship problems (with maybe the exception of Hugh Grant's character.  I mean, after all he WAS the prime minister and all that).

First of all, every single notable British actor that you can think of is in this movie. The plot follows approximately ten different couples who are struggling through their respective relationships. Some of my favorite couples are Hugh Grant's character (the Prime Minister) and his outspoken assistant, Liam Neeson and his adorable son, and Colin Firth and his Portuguese maid. The best scenes in the film are between Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, who portray a married couple going through a rough patch. This is an amazing movie that will have you in fits of laughter one minute and fighting back tears the next.

The various stories take place in the month in December in the weeks leading up to Christmas. For the most part, I found most the stories to be so unbelivible.  The only one that seemed real was the story of actress Laura Linney character trying to find love while dealing with a mentally ill brother.  That story was the only reason that I gave &quot;Love Actually&quot; three stars.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2GZTI0EIOCQNZ	"M. Hind ""daria_m"""	"""Love Actually"" is just the right mix of romantic comedy and drama to leave you with that warm, fuzzy feeling as you leave the theatre.  It's an ideal Christmas movie for moms and dads who want to see something else while the kids venture into more PG films.Writer/director Richard Curtis enlists a plethora of some of the finest British actors (and a few noteworthy Americans) to tell several different love stories.  While it seems that there may be a few too many characters at first, the overall flow of the film allows the viewer to keep track quite easily.  The cast is led by the ever-so-charming Hugh Grant as the British Prime Minister.  While some critics have called this casting unbelievable, Grant actually pulls it off by portraying a more human, but yet stronger PM that we would all love to have leading us.  His dance to the Pointer Sisters' ""Jump for My Love"" borders a bit on ridiculous, but it is nevertheless fun to watch.  In the film, the PM is caught between leading his country with a clear head, or giving in to his feelings of attraction to his tea server Natalie (played by musical actress Martine McCutcheon).And then there's Emma Thompson, who plays Karen, sister to Grant's PM and a long-married devoted mother.  She suspects that her husband Harry (Alan Rickman) may be cheating with a sexy co-worker.  Her performance, simply put, is a revelation.  The scene where she is in her bedroom is an example of phenominal acting.  Hollywood Foreign Press and Academy members: please take notice!Another strong performance award goes to Bill Nighy, who provides most of the film's comic relief as aging rock star Billy Mack.  He puts out a cheesy Christmas record and then publicly bashes it.  But in classic Hollywood ending style, he does have an epiphany and realizes his wild musician life has been missing true affection.Liam Neeson shines as widower Daniel who tries to help his young stepson win the heart of a popular school crush.  Equally sweet is Colin Firth as Jamie, a man recovering from a broken relationship in France who falls for his monolingual Portuguese maid.  You know what?  This film is such an abundance of great performances that I will run out of space discussing them all!  Everybody shines!  My only cast complaint is that Rowan Atkinson should have been given more screen time.What I also love about ""Love Actually"" is that Curtis doesn't, if you'll pardon the pun, wrap up each story in a happy little Christmas package.  There are a few sad, realistic moments, particularly in the Karen/Harry subplot and in Laura Linney's turn as Sarah, an assistant who has waited so long to be with the man she loves.  She realizes, in some of the film's key dramatic instances, that family matters are getting in the way.All in all, Curtis has struck gold again, in tradition of movies like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Bridget Jones' Diary.""  Yeah, some of the love stories may be a little far-fetched, but aren't they all in fantasy movie world?  What matters is that they are sweet and not without their share of obstacles.  This film is a nice departure from some of the more disturbing violent films as of late.  But be warned: it is a little more adult than most other comedies in theatres. The innuendos, language, and nudity earn the R-rating.  So see it without the young kids, but do enjoy."	5.0	"""Love actually is all around..."""	2003-11-19	359	331	28

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1TJPMB7N776WS	MICHAEL ACUNA	"Richard Curtis, the director of ""Love Actually"" wrote the scripts for ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" Notting Hill"" and co-wrote ""Bridget Jones' Diary."" So he knows of what he speaks, romantic-comedy-wise.""Love Actually"" is literate, smart and has enough horse sense to realize that in most cases Love is complicated, hotly sought after and rigorously fought for: in other words it's not a walk in the park though, it often takes that route.Curtis has assembled many of the same faces we have seen in his other comedies: Hugh Grant, Colin Firth to name a couple and all the other actors are charming and quite attractive, but I think in order to give this film the flavor of the others mentioned above, he may have given us too many sub-plots of which some are not as interesting as others. But chalk this up to first time director jitters because so much of what Curtis puts on screen is fun and witty. In particular Bill Nighy as Billy Mack, an almost washed up Rock Star looking for a comeback hit record, who records a Christmas version of ""Love is All Around"" and promotes it to a apoplectic radio dj as instead of from ""some smug teenager... from an old ex heroin addict looking for a number one record at any price.""Though Curtis has applied the kitchen sink style of directing to this his first feature, most of what he does works i.e. its funny or charming or both. What he has created is a big gold box tied with a giant red bow of a movie: one that you can take a date to, invite your English teacher to or take your spinster aunt to. ""Love Actually"" then is about all of us who have ever jumped into that big morass of goo called Love, survived scathed or unscathed, not always smarter for having done it yet forever willing to try it again."	4.0	All I Want For Christmas	2003-11-07	1	0	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	"I have to admit it...I LOVED This movie...Maybe it is a ""chick"" movie; maybe it borders on schmaltz and sentimentality..who cares?  Richard Curtis has crafted a movie that is wonderfully entertaining, peopled it with an outstanding list of well known and not so well known actors, set it at Christmastime, and I had a smile on my face almost the entire movie.  This is brilliant film-making.  I even enjoyed the deleted scenes!!!BILL NIGHY & GREGOR FISHER - Bill is outstanding as the has-been rock star who wants his new unabashedly awful Christmas song to be the # 1 song for the holidays.  He is rude, crude, potty mouthed, obnoxious, but ultimately loveable.  His relationship with his manager Joe (Fisher) culminates in a wonderfully tender scene where Billy admits his love.COLIN FIRTH & LUCIA MONIZ as Jamie and his Portuguese housekeeper are a delightful pair, whose descent into love is touching, poignant and humorous.  The scene where Firth proposes and the whole town joins in is cinematic hoodoo, but what fun it is!LIAM NEESON & THOMAS SANGSTER - this is Liam's finest work since SCHINDLER'S LIST.  His recently widowed stepdad to Sangster's brilliantly precocious Sam is a highlight of the movie.  Tender, warm, and extremely funny at times.  Sangster's love for his schoolmate Joanna is so representative of young puppy love.EMMA THOMPSON & ALAN RICKMAN - Thompson is superb; her scene alone in the bedroom without one word of dialogue reflects the kind of actress this lady is.  Rickman is good too as the husband tempted by his lucscious secretary (played very well by Heike Makatsch).LAURA LINNEY & RODRIGO SANTORO have the less uplifting relationship.  She is a hard working woman who feels responsible for her mentally ill brother, who is institutionalized, paranoid and schizophrenic.  Rodrigo is the office nerd who is really quite a stud and when he and Linney finally get a chance to express their feelings, phone calls from her brother interfere.  Linney is a brilliant actress and she does wonders with this difficult role.HUGH GRANT & MARTINE MCCUTCHEON - Hugh is at home in this movie, even improbably cast as the Prime Minister.  But Hugh is Hugh, and his dashing aplomb and carefree masculinity match the torrid undercurrent of McCutcheon's Natalie.  His putdown of President Billy Bob Thornton is marvelous.MARTIN FREEMAN & JOANNA PAGE - what a hoot!  Here we have two young people who are standins for sexual scenes of some movie, and they talk about the weather, the Prime Minister and all other kinds of things while in very compromising positions.  Quite original and well played.KRIS MARSHALL is Colin, a self-proclaimed stud who ventures off to America to find babes.  One would think that he would turn out luckless, especially since he chooses to go to Wisconsin.  But true to Curtis' originality, Colin scores right away with not one, but four luscious babes.  Charming.KEIRA KNIGHTLEY and ANDREW LINCOLN - she's recently wed to Lincoln's best friend, and for all intents and purposes, it looks like he resents the marriage.  We all know of course the real reason for his behavior.  Wonderfully played out by these two charming actors.There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie, and the entire cast is sublime and perfect!I didn't think I would like this movie at first, but it is one of my favorite movies I've seen in some time.Forget the schmaltz, just enjoy the company!!!"	5.0	LOVE DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE TO HURT	2004-05-28	6	3	3

While this is a romantic comedy, it is also one of the funnier movies I have seen in a long time.  Bill Nighy is certainly one of the funniest characters in the movie and his interviews with the press had me laughing so hard I was crying.While the movie does try to cover a lot of ground in a small time period (there are 8 couples and story lines to keep track of), it does all come together in the end.  What works about these various story lines is that they all have different types of loves and are at different stages in their lives.  I found myself thinking ""I remember when I was there"" and wondering what love has in store for me in the future.  Maybe, like the Bill Nighy character I will learn that I really do love some of the people that right now I find annoying.Yes, this is a feel good movie and yes, it is a romantic comedy.  However, loving is part of being human and I think that most people can identify with at least one of the many characters or storylines.  If you're old enough, you will probably identify with more than one.  I know that I did."	4.0	"not just another ""date"" film"	2004-12-01	3	2	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2I3XS9TO93Q0F	"Michael Meredith ""e-Mike"""	"Gosh... where to start, other than to say that I love this movie!Yeah, it's complicated by a whole raft of story lines, subplots and an incredibly large cast.  But it works, with the type of charm that most movies can only hint at.  True to it's premise, Love Actually highlights love in so many varied ways that it's difficult to fully appreciate it with only a single viewing.  This is a DVD that deserves to be purchased, kept and watched year after year.If there is such a thing as an R-rated Christmas classic, this is it.  Yes, there is some nudity, language and a lot of adult themes sprinkled around, so Love Actually isn't the type of movie that you want to break out after the family finishes opening gifts (unless your elderly aunt has fallen asleep in the barcalounger and the younger set is too busy with their new GameBoys to be aware of anything else).Besides having the common thread of ""love"", all of the stories feature characters with direct, tenuous or happenstance connections that manage to hold everything together.  There is the aged rock star (Bill Nighy) promoting his trashy treacle of a Christmas song, along with his long-suffering manager.Meanwhile, after discovering his girlfriend's infidelity, mystery writer Jamie (Colin Firth) retreats to France where he falls under the spell of his housekeeper Aurelia (the soulful L&uacute;cia Moniz).  Their budding connection is highlighted by the subtitled dialog since he speaks only English and she speaks Portuguese.Liam Neeson is newly widowed, coping with his grief while helping his stepson Sam (a kid named Thomas Sangster who will make the pulse of every 12 year old girl race, and every mother's heart melt).Then there is Emma Thompson, the sister of the newly elected Prime Minister, balancing children in the Christmas Pageant case - her daughter is the ""first lobster"" -  with her attentions to her husband, Alan Rickman who is the target of a predatory seductress.  And her brother the PM (Hugh Grant) has eyes for the new domestic employee at Number 10 Downing Street (Martine McCutcheon).  Of course, Billy Bob Thornton as the US President has more lascivious thoughts regarding her, so that might complicate things a little.But that's not all!  Laura Linney pines over her coworker (they both work for Rickman) Keira Knightley plays a lovely newlywed who isn't aware that her husbands best friend is head over heels in love with her himself.  Oh, and lest I forget, there is the actor and actress that meet while filming a porn movie (told you there was nudity).  And a young man frustrated by his inability to hit it off with the local women, pursues his dream of meeting uninhibited American women by flying off to Milwaukee!Rowan Atkinson also provides two brief but critically important scenes as a jewelry salesman with a decidedly unhurried manner.  And for the shallow-minded males of the family, there are cameo appearances by Claudia Schiffer, Elisha Cuthbert, Denise Richards and Shannon Elizabeth.Is that enough for you?  It darn well should be!  There are a few construction flaws in the whole thing, primarily with the timeline of events being artificially compacted into the five weeks before Christmas, but the overall charm and the collection of winning performances cancel any complaints you might have in that regard.One final note.  If you don't buy the DVD, at least buy the soundtrack!  The music is wonderful!"	5.0	A Mature Christmas Classic!	2006-12-19	4	3	1

It's the same exact movie, except in BluRay with better sound and crisper HiDef. But no new scenes, no new extras. But there is a Christmas ornament.The movie is still 5 stars, so I can't really take away from that. But the BluRay, other than the obvious better picture, was kind of a disappointment.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	"Yes, the old saying is true, love is all around us. There is no real chance anyone has of escaping its effects as best we try sometimes. For as simple an act as falling in love may seem, falling out of love or moving on after lover lost is never quite as easy a thing to actually carry out. It is never a gracious thing to go through life believing what our mothers had always told us, that there would be someone out there for every one of us, especially when you have nothing with you now to show for it. As hard as we might try, it is practically impossible when we are alone to prevent our minds from racing with the thoughts of ""what if I never find that special someone"". There is always tomorrow, you tell yourself day in and day out as the weeks and months slip slowly by like tiny grains of sand through a timer, wondering within your subconscious how long you can keep this act up of fooling yourself with such nonsense. Depression inevitably sinks in as life pitches you the perfect no-hitter in the field of relationships, knocking you about as if you were the universe's personal whore. All around you see couples holding each other's hands and clinging tight to their loved ones while you travel the seemingly desolate sidewalks alone and downtrodden. If love is as chaotic as everyone makes it out to be, why is it that we find ourselves returning to it time and again despite the afflictive lessons of the past? Love is simply a natural occurrence, instinctive really, and there is nothing you or anyone else can do to control those feelings you have for someone close and dear to you, even if they may not know it just yet. Love, when lost or unrequited, can truly be dispiriting, but once you are able to get back on that horse it can be the most completely fulfilling experience of your life and no one should prevent themselves from embracing it head on.The story is a mingled interweaving of several individual storylines, all of which involve the enchanting, if not often perplexing, subject of love written by Richard Curtis, the man behind such romantic comedies as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, and Bridget Jones's Diary. With just five weeks left until Christmas, London, England is abuzz with men and women sorting out their love lives, or lack of them. The film begins with David, the recently elected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who, not even seconds into the door of his new home, has fallen deeply in love with his catering manager Natalie, recently dumped by her ex-boyfriend who complained of her being ""too fat"". David's younger sister Karen attempts to juggle a crippling relationship with her husband, Harry, the operator of a local magazine, who has become quite friendly with his flirtatious secretary Mia, and helping her friend Daniel cope with the recent passing of his wife. While attempting to move on with his life, Daniel must also help navigate his eleven year old son through a situation of his own, having fallen in love with an American girl who happens to be the most popular girl at school. Karen is also friends with Jamie Bennett, a novelist who has temporarily relocated to France to nurse his broken heart after discovering his girlfriend cheating on him with his much younger and more attractive brother, only to be captivated by Aurelia, the Portuguese housekeeper of his country villa. Harry's best editor Sarah is absolute smitten by Karl, a fellow magazine editor, and has been ever since she started working at the magazine over a year ago but has not had the courage to tell him how she has felt and complications with her brother, who is currently in the asylum, has not made her personal life any easier. Juliet has just married Peter not realizing that his best friend Mark, the photographer, has been infatuated with her ever since they first met, though he has never spoken a word of this to anyone, let alone herself. Colin Frissell, a lascivious waiter at Peter and Juliet's wedding reception, unable to connect with British women decides to travel to the states, specifically Wisconsin, to score with a bunch of American girls relying solely on his ""British charm"". And burnt-out former British rock-icon Billy Mack, desperate for a comeback to the top of the charts after overcoming a long standing heroin addiction, acts as the main connection for all these individual love-lines.The story for Love Actually is almost as complicated a matter, ironically, as the concept of love itself. In order to find all the connections between the characters and understand the unfolding of events within the framework of the picture one must truly pay attention throughout the interwoven storylines but it is not as complicated a concept as it would seem. We connect with the characters and their actions on screen almost instantaneously because we, as individuals, see ourselves and our own lovelorn, often foolish, actions paraded in front of us on screen. Having experienced at least one, if not more, of the complex love stories in our own lives, we are at long last able to see our own actions for ourselves and are able to gain a fresh perspective and a far better understanding of those events, thus putting our minds, and perhaps even our souls, at ease for it.Colin Firth works splendidly as Jamie Bennett, a man so desperate to escape the pangs of lost love that he flees the country to concentrate on his novel only to fall in love once again with a charming woman who doesn't speak a word of English. This just goes to show that love is both blind and strong and it can not be deterred by the mere language barriers that have separated us in so many other functions of human interaction throughout the world. It would have been more appropriate for the filmmakers to have taken Liam Neeson's Daniel a little more serious - the events at the funeral were not offensive given the context but they did seem a tad bit out place considering it was a funeral after all - being how he lost his wife but this is a comedy and it was expected for them not to dwell too longingly on the rather serious subject matter. The deteriorating relationship between Karen and Harry, played eloquently by Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman respectfully, on other hand, was handled as it should have been allowing the audience to contemplate in their head the events, not always in consecutive order, that can lead to love loss in a relationship to love found in another and how everyone in that triangle is affected by it. The most charming scene in the entire film has to be when Mark, played with such effort by Andrew Lincoln, visits Juliet on Christmas Eve and tells her, silently via the use of cue-cards (clever) and carol music, how he has always felt about her but never bucked up the courage to tell her until now. Often, when we lose someone close to our heart to another man or woman, quite possibly forever, we instinctively want to shut out those feelings we once had for that person and attempt to move on with our lives as best we can but never seems to work out. We, as human beings, need closure with any close relationship we have in our lives, whether it involves family, friends, or loves, and we can never fully move on until we let our feelings be known to that person. It is better for us to act upon those feelings then to hold them in, worrying ourselves to death with the thought of ""had she/he but known"", even if nothing is to come about as a result of this forthrightness, as this particular scenes demonstrates. Then and only then can we be one within our mind once again, telling ourselves ""enough"" and having the ability now to move on fully with our life. Billy Bob Thornton makes a cheap cameo in the role of the President of the United States. Though his slick southern persona and entirely unlikable womanizing style, eerily renascent of William Jefferson Clinton, are worth a few laughs, he contributes practically nothing to the storyline and could have easily been downplayed or excluded from the film altogether. Originally Rowan Atkinson's character, Rufus, the jewelry department salesman, was supposed to be an angel and would have disappeared after passing Daniel in the airport near the end of the film, which would have done a better job in clearing up his involvement in both Harry's and Daniel's son's relationships but as it stands it works out fine.Overall, critics may complain about Love Actually's uniquely over-the-top nature and its ability to be so overtly clich&eacute;d even for its own good but, in actuality, often love is like that sometimes - it is never as spontaneous or original as we would want it to be but it retains its charm and effective none the less, which goes hand-in-hand with this film and enduring message. Despite creating a distinctively potent and dazzling directorial debut, there are several aspects to the film that failed to pan out properly for Richard Curtis. For example, though come-back rocker Billy Mack does tie all the loose coalition of storylines together and ultimately lends help to the charming, if not overtly clich&eacute;d, ending involving Daniel's son and the love of his life at the airport, his own storyline on the other hand feels flat and uninteresting. Either his character should have been expanded or simply pushed more into the background as a mere side character instead of what is given to us here. John and Judy, the couple that meets on the set for a stimulated love scene for a motion picture, are two other supporting characters that could have been left out of the film entirely as they contribute nothing to the story at all. It is fantastic to see that Curtis wants to demonstrate love lost and found in a variety of situations but there is a point when so much becomes too much and you eventually have to cut something loose to balance the feature out again, something Curtis fails to do here. But these are comparatively minor slip-ups, as unnecessary and inconvenient to the overall storyline as they may be, and hardly leave a lasting affect on the film's clear-cut purpose and contemplative message that love is truly all we need in this world to be happy. True, the sole intention of this film was that of romantic comedy but it does not hurt to pay closer attention to the events that unfold within this feature and perhaps gain a clear understanding of a situation in our own complicated love life, one we may not have obtained else where. Love actually is all around us - all we have to do is open our eyes and see it for ourselves."	4.0	The Moose Hole - Lovely, 'Actually'	2005-04-15	6	2	4

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3R36DZQEWNVJ1	Mike Bolts	"Love Actually is a story...no wait, I should say it has different stories within itself about people from The Prime Minister, to an aging Rock Star, to a Writer, to a guy who wants to meet women in America to other people who fall in love around Christmas time. Hugh Grant (upcoming American Dreamz, About a Boy) plays The Prime Minister who falls in love with his catorer Natalie played by Martine McCutcheon (Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang). Liam Neeson (Batman Begins, Kingdom Of Heaven) lost his wife and his son is falling in love with a girl from America, so the son learns how to play drums to try to impress her. Colin Firth (Girl With a Pearl Earring) is a Writer who falls in love with Aurelia, played by Lucia Moniz (29 Golpes). Alan Rickman (Die Hard, Dogma) is married to Emma Thompson (Nanny McPhee, Dead Again), go figure, and he also is getting hit on by a woman he works with and Bill Nighy (Underworld 1&2, Constant Gardener) plays Billy Mack, an aging Rock Star. It's really funny at times, especially Bill Nighy who delivers a great performance. It's filled with a lot of British actors and actresses...a lot but then there are some cameo appearances by Billy Bob Thornton (Bad Santa), Denise Richards (Wild Things), Elisha Cuthbert (House Of Wax), January Jones (Amerian Wedding), Claudia Schiffer (Black & White), Ivana Milicevic (In Her Shoes) and Shannon Elizabeth (Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back). It's quite long (135 minutes hmmm, they could of shortened it dont you think?). Also starring Keira Knightley (Pride & Prejudice, Domino), Chiwetel Ejiofor (upcoming Inside Man, Serenity), Martin Freeman (Shaun of The Dead), Laura Linney (Exorcism of Emily Rose, p.s.), Andrew Lincoln (Enduring Love), Sienna Guillory (Helen of Troy), Heike Makatsch (Resident Evil) and Rowan Atkinson (Johnny English, Bean). Probably not for everyone but it is certainly enjoyable. Billy Mack says ""Hiya kids. Here is an important message from your Uncle Bill. Don't buy drugs.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1O1Q57R1RXROR	"Miranda Mercer ""crazy-dreams"""	"Heartwarming is the most appropriate word to describe this movie. I first saw it in the cinema and I couldn't get the smile off my face afterwards. When I saw the DVD at the store I couldn't resist and I'm pleased to report that it has the same effect on repeat viewings.The multiple storylines have the potential to disengage the viewer, yet terrific acting by the mammoth cast and director Richard Curtis' unashamed sentimentality leave you caring about each and every character, more so than some romantic comedies that focus on only one couple. My personal favourite is Liam Neeson's character, a widower bonding with his love-struck young stepson. Hugh Grant's prime minister also has an hilarious dancing scene after taking a stand against the US president (Billy Bob Thornton) (a pointless story arc, thrown in to demonstrate yet another form of love, this time patriotic).Not every story has a happy ending. Notably, those of the devoted sister (Laura Linney) torn between her mentally ill brother and her sexy co-worker and her boss (Alan Rickman), who may or may not be cheating on his wife (Emma Thompson).The film is not without it's flaws. Some characters are less-than-endearing, such as Colin and his quest to get laid in America, yet they are not allowed enough screen time to truly irritate. The tenuous connections linking all the character are completely unbelievable, but somehow add to the film's charm.At times it seems like Curtis has tried to cram almost too much into the movie, and some storylines are poorer for it. Ultimately, however, the technique pays off. Any one of these storylines could have been made into an entire film, and it would have been just another formulaic Hollywood movie, this at least strives for some degree of originality in it's focus on a variety of relationships at various stages, rather than just two beautiful young things getting together.I have heard this film criticised for being unrealistic, but it's a romantic comedy, what do you expect? It IS romantic and it IS funny, but it also has moments that 'real' people can relate to, like the pain of being in love with someone you can never have. If you want a dose of harsh reality, go watch a documentary, or the news. If you want a heartwarming, enjoyable piece of fluff that will make you believe, if only for the duration of the closing credits, that ""love, actually is all around,"" then you need to see this movie. Just don't make the mistake of taking it all too seriously."	4.0	Heartwarming	2004-05-23	1	0	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	&quot;Love,Actually&quot; is a feel-good Christmastime collection of love stories  from writer/director Richard Curtis that aim to say, in spite of strife and bad goings-on in the world, &quot;love  actually is all around&quot;. In London, beginning five weeks before Christmas, ten different but loosely connected love stories unfold.  As the Holiday season builds toward its climax, so do the relationships. The newly elected Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) falls head over heels for a member of his staff (Martine McCutcheon) on his first day on the job. A novelist (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese maid (Lucia Moniz) find love in spite of -or perhaps because of- the language barrier. Newlyweds and long-married couples alike discover chinks in their relationships and new possibilities. Young and old discover loss and new love. And throughout the film, the wonderful Bill Nighy plays a curmudgeonly aging pop star who uses every opportunity his new hit single provides him to inject a little sardonic  humor into the holiday cheer.Truthfully,at two hours and fifteen minutes, &quot;Love, Actually&quot; is too long for a romantic comedy. And it's slow in places. And it improves upon viewing during the Holiday season. But it's a charming film with a very appealing -and very large- cast. Sometimes it's a little too cute, but Bill Nighy's Billy Mack character is likely to amuse even resolutely cynical members of the audience. So there's something for everyone. And the love stories are more light-hearted than sappy. &quot;Love, Actually&quot; is fun, light entertainment.The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary, deleted scenes, a documentary on the film's music, a music video for &quot;The Trouble with Love Is&quot; by Kelly Clarkson, and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). The audio commentary features writer/director Richard Curtis and actors Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy, Thomas Sangster, and a couple of others whom I couldn't identify. Three of the actors are seeing the film for the first time, so their commentary is very conversational. Director Richard Curtis does mos t of the talking, however, and provides a lot of information. There are 37 minutes of deleted scenes, all of which are introduced by the director. Curtis' introductions and explanations are good, but, unfortunately, the scenes must be viewed one after the other. There is no way to choose what scenes to watch. In &quot;The Music  of Love Actually&quot;, director Richard Curtis talks about the five songs featured in the film and their influence on the script as he was writing it. Captioning is available in English. Subtitles and dubbing are available in French and Spanish.	4.0	Long, Charming, and Christmas-y.	2004-05-21	5	3	2

From that point on, I never stopped smiling.It's now three days later and I haven't stopped smiling.A movie you want to wrap your arms around and hug, ""Love Actually"" is an anthology of love stories involving over a dozen people set in modern pre-Christmas London.A woefully incomplete list:Hugh Grant, the new young British PM, falls for his tea server. Newly widowed Liam Neeson bonds with his young stepson. The stepson is hopelessly smitten by a girl in his class named Joanna. Emma Thompson plays the PM's sister, married to Alan Rickman. He is disaffected with his home life, and is flirting with the idea of flirting with his secretary. Laura Linney works for Rickman, and has a crush on a co-worker, but her life is complicated by a mentally ill brother. Two adult film stand-ins develop a sweet relationship while hanging around nude and simulating sex so the film crew can set up for the real deal. The adult film directors' roommate heads to the U.S. because all U.S. women are hot, and they all want to have sex with English men.Supposedly.Keira Knightly is a newlywed who discovers someone else may be drawn to her. Bill Nighy steals the film as an aged rock star, angling for the Number One spot on the charts. Writer Colin Firth obsessing about his new Portuguese housekeeper.Well, you KNOW how this movie is going to end. You really do. It's no surprise.If it didn't end the way you THOUGHT it would, it would suck.It's like music. You expect verse-chorus-verse, maybe a guitar solo here or some background vocals there, but the overall pattern is constant. It's the CONTENT that sets it apart.This film is SO funny, with so many loops and asides, you'll be giddy. It's smart and sweet and heartwarming, all in the best way without being sappy or cloying.This film is LOADED with uncredited guest stars. I won't spoil all the fun (there's at least a half dozen) but when the daughter from the TV show ""24"" showed up, I giggled. Get a load of the guy who plays the President of The United States. An absolute hoot.The soundtrack is astonishing. An absolutely perfect melding of pop songs/performances to situations. Eva Cassidy's 'Songbird"" is appropriately aching. The Beach Boys ""God Only Knows"" soars. The movie ends with a Christmas pageant performance bringing many (if not all) of the characters together, and little Joanna brings down the house.While it is a romantic comedy, not every tale has a conventional or happy ending. Some are, yes, but others are bittersweet. Unrequited love. Familial love. The love between best friends, or old friends.Puppy love, which if you think about it, may be the purest form of true love. You just like somebody, and you don't know or care why. You just do and that's it.The love of sex. The love of possible sex. Love AFTER sex.Love of parents, children, brothers, sisters, co-workers and colleagues; the love of cultures, of tradition, of language...So I guess the overall theme of the film really is just love, actually."	5.0	"A shining example of a ""feel good"" film!"	2004-06-02	9	7	2

His venture into movie writing was as successful, and Four Weddings and A Funeral and Notting Hill are now considered as classics.What is surprising though is Curtis's abilities as a director. He has managed to tell his own script with such ease, sympathy, and simplicity, and to direct more than twenty main characters, each to a varying degrees with a three dimensional and deep personalities.Love Actually is actually a film that combines some very funny scenes with a lot of poignancy...It is all about love as we know or experience it.Love that crosses language barriers, love that means sacrifice, love that is dedication, love that can be an instant infatuation, love that means forgiveness, love that means fantasy, love that means to just be there, love as in hope, in short love as in life..There are ten stories of different kinds of love that occasionally cross paths, colorful canvases of different people, and different relationships, and different loves.The casting could not have been better, from Liam Neeson, Laura Linney (one of the best American and most underrated actresses),Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman,Martine McCutcheon, Bill Nighy and two of Curtis's personal friends from the old days, Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant.There are also plenty of very well cast cameos, from Billy Bob Thorton as the American President, Rowan Atkinson as a salesman (although he is billed as one of the main stars, his role is actually very small),Sienna Guillory, Claudia Schiffer, to January Jones and Denise Richards.The most hilarious dialogues and scenes come courtesy of Grant as the prime minister!! You should just hear what he says talking to the painting of Mrs Thatcher!! But every one contributes equally to make you laugh, smile, and reflect..The film starts and ends at Heathrow, with the images of people greeting, hugging and kissing each other and a very touching narrative tells us about how the message of the plane passengers of the 9/11 tragedy in their final calls was about love and forgiveness and not hate and revenge. It is ultimately the message of Curtis himself, and throughout the film until  the end you realize just how significant and true this message is.Love Actually is a MUST SEE movie that is totally endearing, one that will make you feel so good about love and life!DO NOT MISS!	5.0	From London With Lots of Love	2004-04-23	1	1	0

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2QWEFSPX33C5L	Modrnknght	"I saw Love Actually when it opened in theaters.  I was already a HUGE fan of Notting Hill, and so looked forward to writer Richard Curtis' next film, which turned out to be LA, and with him directing it, too.  I went in with high hopes, and while I did like it, I was a bit disappointed because it wasn't as good as NH.  But that's changed...I still believe Notting Hill is the better of the two film, but with each viewing of this movie I do actually love Love Actually!  Curtis has combined a number of stories of friends, husband, wives, and lovers that crossover into each other, each one with romance and each with laughs, and the first time I saw it I thought he had too many plotpoints.  But now I feel it really works.Curtis, who also wrote Four Weddings and a Funeral and the Black Adder TV series, knows how to deliver a comedy line almost better than anyone else.  And many other lines are quite precious.  Come on, it is impossible to resist a film that has a kid saying to his stepfather, ""Okay, Dad.  Let's do it.  Let's go get the shit kicked out of us by love.""And what a cast!  Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Keira Knightley, Martine McCutcheon, Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman (The Hobbit), Joanna Page (Stacey in TV series Gavin & Stacey), and other wonderful actors, including two well-played appearances by Curtis veteran Rowan Atkinson.  Also look for January Jones (Mad Men),  Elisha Cuthbert (24), Ivana Milicevic (Bond girl in Casino Royale), Denise Richards, Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie), and Claudia Schiffer.  Plus Billy Bob Thornton.Picture quality is very good, a step up from the DVD.  Audio is terrific, and makes full use of speakers in many musical background moments.Extras are carried over from the DVD (in standard definition) and they are quite rich.  There's about 35 minutes in deleted scenes; plus Curtis introducing choices of music for the film; a couple of music videos; a featurette on the making; and a very funny commentary with Curtis, Hugh Grant, and others (Grant makes fun of Firth whenever he shows up on screen).HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  A great film for Christmas viewing."	5.0	Totally enjoyable romantic comedy that gets better with each viewing	2012-12-01	1	0	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3QLAOOTFEHCJI	M. Oleson	"This is a terrific movie for Christmas for those wanting the seasonal themes without the specificity.  Set in London, the film has all the appearances of one of those holiday movies we see several times a year (New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day) and in fact is.  The difference is that this one is well done.  The music alone (no not Christmas carols) is worth the price of admission (or purchase or rental).  Several stories evolve at the same time.  The characters are loosely connected in some way, although it isn't all that evident for a while.  In fact if there is a dig at the film it may be that there are too many story lines.Director and writer Richard Curtis assembles a cast that Robert Altman would have been proud of.  Liam Neeson is a recent widower raising his step-son.  Hugh Grant is the recently elected British Prime Minister, single but looking.  Keira Knightley is a new bride who may have married the wrong man.  Andrew Lincoln (TV's ""Walking Dead"") may be the right man.  Bill Nighy is hilarious as an aging rock star trying again with a Christmas twist on an old song.  Laura Linney is a spinster-like office employee longing over a co-worker but obligated to care for an institutionalized brother.  Emma Thompson is the wife of an executive (Alan Rickman) who may be cheating on her.  Kris Marshall is the hound dog Brit who can't get a date so decides to go to Wisconsin (!) where he's sure he can find plenty of women who will love his accent.  He does!  They are Shannon Elizabeth, January Jones, Elisha Cuthbert, Denise Richards and Ivana Milicevic.  There is the couple whose job is too ""stand in"" for actors in a porn film and eventually fall in love.  Finally, there is Colin Firth, a writer who falls for his housekeeper (Lucia Moniz) who doesn't speak English.I know this all sounds so convoluted, but it works.  The writing is crisp and funny.  The film is sweet and moving at times.  There is humor, heartbreak and romance.  I'm also glad to see that the filmmakers and studio kept the ""R"" rating rather than excise some of the more titillating scenes and change the language.  Well done.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3I1H3RDJM3587	Morgen Moxley	"Love Actually is the most touching film I have seen in awhile. It is probably one of the only movies that I can watch time and time again, only loving it more each time. It came out in 2003 and was an immediate hit among young and old. There are many subplots with in the movie, and they are all connected in some way. Each of the eight main characters has a dilemma that deals with love. Whether the characters are falling in love or out of love, this movie links every love interest possible. The tagline of the movie that brings all the stories together is simply that ""love actually is all around."" The film is a romantic comedy that is sure to capture the hearts of everyone.The movie takes place in London, England, five weeks before Christmas. Each character is introduced in the beginning of the movie. The movie is set up using a vignette style to tell the story. Each character is battling or embracing love in some way, and as each story unfolds, so did my love for this movie.Love Actually was written and directed by Richard Curtis. Richard was born in New Zealand in November of 1956. He has been nominated for many awards including the Golden Globe award for Bridget Jones Diary in 2001 and 2002, an Oscar award for Four Weddings and a Funeral in 1994 and Love Actually in 2003 and 2004, and an Emmy for The Girl in the Caf&eacute; in 2005. These are his four most famous movies. I've seen them all, and they are all brilliant. He is also known for the British character Mr. Bean, who also makes an appearance in Love Actually. Curtis attended college at Oxford University. When he was in college, his girlfriend left him for a man named Bernard. In each of his screenplays, there is an unpopular character named Bernard.This movie is so wonderful because of the conclusions these characters come to at the very end. After each story of love has had its beautiful revelation, the characters are all very content with their lives. The last scene is at an airport, where all the different characters are brought together, waiting on someone they love. It is a very emotional scene, and an amazing ending to the movie. I definitely recommend this movie to anybody who will watch it. It is hilarious, romantic, and inspiring."	5.0	Love Actually is All Around	2007-10-31	4	1	3

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AB7W3IO5V7CT0	moviewatcher	"2003's ""Love Actually"" told the story of nine different relationships in London.  Starting off five weeks before Christmas and slowly moving towards the holidays, will everyone find love during the festive season?Yes, there are NINE different scenarios happening during the film.  The first is with England's new Prime Minister (Hugh Grant).  While trying to adjust to the ins and outs of things and a run in with the U.S. President (Billy Bob Thornton), he becomes intrigued with Natalie (Martine McCutcheon), who works in the office.We're also introduced to Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) and his manager, Joe (Gregor Fisher).  Billy is an aging rock star who is looking for a comeback by remaking one of his songs into a holiday tune.  Much to the dismay of Joe, Billy decides to be brutally honest about everything when appearing on radio and TV shows while promoting the song.Daniel (Liam Neeson) is in a different predicament.  Daniel's wife has just passed away leaving him alone with young son Sam (Thomas Sangster).  Although Daniel has a fascination with Claudia Schiffer, it's Sam who finds himself head over heels in love with a schoolmate.  With Daniel's help, Sam decides to win her over by impressing her.Daniel's friend (and the Prime Minister's sister), Karen (Emma Thompson) also has difficulties.  Karen is trying to cope with the daily routines of family life where her days are filled with making costumes for her children's school recital while her husband, Harry (Alan Rickman), fights various temptations that face him at work.Another scenario is the love triangle of Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Mark (Andrew Lincoln).  When Peter marries Juliet it's obvious that Mark has a certain dislike for her.  Or does he?One of the people in attendance at the wedding of Peter and Juliet is Jamie (Colin Firth).  When he returns home he discovers the awful truth about his brother and girlfriend.  He leaves and goes to a house in the country where he can work on his novel.  He soon strikes up a friendship with his Portuguese housekeeper, Aurelia (Lucia Moniz).  Unfortunately Aurelia and Jamie do not speak the other's language.Sarah (Laura Linney) works in the same office as Harry and is secretly (but everyone knows about it) in love with her co-worker, Karl (Rodrigo Santoro).  Sarah has her hands full, however, with her brother who is in a nearby hospital and demands her constant attention.  Will Sarah and Karl be able to find love?Colin (Kris Marshall), a server at Peter's and Juliet's wedding, has come up with the perfect plan to find women.  He's decided to travel to the United States (Wisconsin) where he's sure he will have no problem finding a female companion.John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) meet while spending time on a film set together.  Their job?  Adult movie stand-ins.I had heard from people who had liked and disliked ""Love Actually"" before seeing the movie.  I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  It had elements of different movies (comedy, drama, romance and even a little music) all rolled into one.  There was also equal screen time to develop each story and to see it through to the finale.The entire cast was excellent.  Laura Linney's performance was heart wrenching as you saw Sarah being pulled between what she thinks she needs to do (take care of her brother) and what her heart is telling her to do (pursue Karl).  Bill Nighy was also hilarious as the rock star that just doesn't care one way or another anymore. And for Hugh Grant fans, the dancing sequence in the Prime Minister's home is a must see.It's easy to see where some moviegoers may dislike the nine different stories happening at once.  The first time you see this you may lose some of the details while jumping from story to story.  However, if you've seen this one once, give it another try.  It may take a couple of tries to see how the people in one story intertwine with the ones in other stories.  I know it did for me!""Love Actually"" has a little bit of everything.  This is definitely a good movie to kick off the holiday season with!"	5.0	A Good Movie For The Holiday Season	2006-04-10	6	5	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2ZVERVFM25MJT	"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283"""	When you go into a Richard Curtis movie (and this time he's director as well) you know exactly what to expect, just as you do when you enter a Hugh Grant movie, and seen as the two names have become somewhat synonymous Love Actually has come under a lot of criticism for predictability.  Attempting a Robert Altman-type tapestry of stories is a brave move, but unfortunately Curtis doesn't pull it off as well as PT Anderson did with Magnolia.This time Grant is (unconvincingly) playing a newly elected Prime Minister who falls in love with his tea-lady Martine McCutcheon, who's perky enthusiasm is past its sell-by-date.  There's also Liam Neesom, trying to teach his 10 year-old to play the drums to catch the eye of his first love, a young girl with the voice of Mariah Carey.  The story is sickly enough, and you can't help but feel Curtis felt this to be prime area for 'hilarous' banter about a 10 year-old in love and the confused but hip step-fater overcoming the death of his wife.  Keira Knightly again proves that she's a rising star in the movies after her stint in Pirate of the Caribbean, an undeniably beautiful screen presence despite her rather wooden acting abilities.  It's a shame then that her story feels like it was lifted straight out of any number of Curtis movies when her husband's best friend decides to tell her he loves her with a set of picture cards on her front doorstep on Christmas Eve.  How perfect is that?  Given the fact that there are such monotonous and sickly moments in the film, it's a big plus that Curtis can still pull off a cracker of a story in other sectors.  Most impressive of the bunch, predictably, is old hand Emma Thompson.  The moment when she realised her husband is having an affair, crying in her room and listening to Joni Mitchell's 'Both Sides Now' is the real heart of the movie, and Alan Rickman is clearly having a ball as the man wanting to relive his youth with his secretary.  Laura Linney gives a fantastically memorable supporting turn as the woman in love with her handsome co-worker but bound to her mentally disabled brother.  The fact that she can turn the comedy (her dance of triumph when she invites her crush inside) and the sadness of her situation proves that she deserves a big movie of her own.  There's also a hilarious subplot involving a geeky lad travelling across to the States convinced that American girls will be crawling over him because of his 'sexy' accent is brilliant.  And of course, Firth is playing Firth only as he knows how in the only truly touching love story of the lot with his hesitant affection for his Portuguese cleaning lady.The fact that Love Actually has so many brilliant sections to it only goes to make the bad parts all the more unfortunate.  Nothing could ever really come close to Four Weddings and a Funeral, but overall this is probably better than Notting Hill and on a par with Bridget Jones's Diary.  Curtis has made the quirky sense of British humour his trademark, and Love Actually was a brave move, which he pulls off in part, and that part's immensely enjoyable.  It's just a shame that there's a fair share of dross to sift through to get to it.	3.0	Enjoyable but over-saccharined romantic comedy	2004-01-13	9	2	7

Richard Curtis had a great success with 4 Weddings and a Funeral. Here he just doubles the number and hopes it will work. I don't like this film for several reasons. 1. It is coy 2. It is is disingenuous. 3. It is trying - as so many do and so few succeed - to repeat a formula.There' s really nothing about this film that is REAL. The dialog is for the most part awful. Just one example, a twelve year old boy, in love with a girl at school, told she is going away, is given the line to his father, ""It's the end of my life AS I KNOW IT"". I could cite a dozen or more examples of this sort of artificiality, but I'll spare everyone's blushes. Richard Curtis is not a great screenwriter. He had one success with "" 4 Weddings"" and that ( judging from this ) is it. His earlier British TV comedies like Blackadder for example were full of embarrassing moments. If you want genuinely funny and consistent romantic comedy, stick to Woody Allen."	2.0	Don' t repeat the formula	2007-04-02	17	13	4

The film flits between different 'romances' but the chemistry between the actors on screen is zero. Its all very predictable, OF COURSE certain people get together at the end, yawn. And what was with that waste-of-space storyline of the man who loved the black man's wife, that wasn't finished, nothing happened with it!I've given it 2 stars not 1 because of the (albeit sparse) funny scenes.	2.0	Very Disapointing	2004-03-31	12	5	7

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AT0E6UBVJMJ6W	Ms Winston	I did not have the opportunity to watch &quot;Love Actually&quot; in the theatre, but I read about it for months in the media and on internet message boards. It certainly did not live up to the standards of the classic &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral,&quot; but having bought the DVD, I know I will watch it again.The biggest problems I had with the movie were 1)too many storylines and 2)some storylines were handled much better than others. The porn movie storyline and the Brit-vacationing-in- America were the two weakest and IMO should have never made it to the screen, as they weren't amusing or touching. The PM storyline was not in the least believable, but Hugh Grant did a wonderful job with a minimum of Grantisms. I was probably one of the few who was not enchanted with the Liam Neeson &amp; stepson storyline: I didn't think it was realistic that a little boy would be more upset about a little girl going back to America than with the death of his beloved mother. I also disliked the airport scene, where adults were encouraging this precocious child to dodge airline security. And just as an aside, I really have a pet peeve about movies that encourage pre-teens to display emotions that are more appropriate for older children or adults -- ugh!The best storylines IMO were the ones involving Laura Linney, Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, and Colin Firth. I hated that the Laura Linney character gave up her chance at happiness to play handmaiden to her mentally ill brother -- it seemed to me that she could &amp; should have had it all! The Rickman-Thompson storyline was the most realistic and therefore to me the most touching. At the end it seemed apparent to me that Ms Thompson's character was going to accomodate her husband's wandering eye in order to keep her family together -- old fashioned, perhaps, but not all that uncommon. Colin Firth's romance with the Portugese maid was touching and funny, especially the final proposal scene. But the honors IMO go to Bill Nigey, whose aging rock star kept the movie from being too sweet and cloying. His disgust with what he had become and the wasted years supporting his heroin addiction were handled masterfully.	3.0	Pleasant, lightweight entertainment.	2004-05-02	4	2	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3VSUJZC7D352O	Nate	Quite possibly the greatest movie I have ever seen, I consider it perfect in every way and have seen it many times and will glady watch it many times again. The most prized DVD in my collection, this wonderful feel good romantic comedy will always leave me feeling good about myself and everyone around me. The message is clear and simple and will rub off on anyone who watches it.Bringing together a stellar cast, it features stunning performances, with incredible pictures and a wonderful music score. Every scene is well scripted and well acted and fits into the film pefectly. It is hard to say who steals the movie but Hugh Grant as the loveable British prime minister or Bill Nighy as an ageing rock star on the comeback trail probably take the cake.The movie is funny, heartwarming and delivers a wonderful message and the perfect movie to watch at christmas, valentines day or even all year round. I condider it flawless in every way and strongly recommend you purchase this movie today.	5.0	If you look closely, love actually......is all around	2006-12-17	1	0	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3FIXINBQSWDUP	natmicstef	This film seemed to have been written by two different writers.  The stories of Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson and Keira Knightley were very touching and poignant.  The stud wannabe going to Wisconsin to meet girls was funny but exaggerated, Hugh Grant's story was totally unrealistic, Colin Firth didn't look remotely in love and Sarah's story seemed to have been written to evince sadness.  As for the nude stand-ins..I imagine a 16 year old writer or director wanting that in a film..no other reason for it.	2.0	Not my idea of a romantic comedy	2006-04-06	9	6	3
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3SF2N0BJF0YJS	N. Caine	I'm not sure why so many people seemed to like this film. It's a romantic comedy.  So either the romance should be good or the comedy or both.  As to romance, I'm not spoiling anything by saying that there is not a single case in this sprawling ensemble plot of one person falling in love with another:  all we get is love at first sight in every case.  It reminded me a lot of that John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale vehicle &quot;Serendipity&quot; where we're just asked to accept the love at first sight premise.  Closer to genre, it's like &quot;Notting Hill&quot; where Roberts and Grant supposedly fall in love right away.  I didn't buy it there:  if you did, you'd probably like this movie.  As to laughs, I really wonder if anyone who praised this movie ever laughed out loud.  I did:  once.  In a shot straight out of the commercial for the movie, three little girls ask Hugh Grant to sing and when he does, they all dance around as only toddler girls can.  It lasts two seconds.  I laughed.  That was the only time.Not only does the film lack laughs, it tries to be the brilliant and singular &quot;About a Boy&quot; way too often.  From the whole plot line of the guy writing a terrible Christmas song that goes number 1, to the Liam Neeson plot which culminates in his son playing an instrument on stage at the school play in order to impress the cool girl he likes, to the jokes about death.  But &quot;About a Boy&quot; was a genuine satire with hints of genius:  not a bunch of one liners.  To give you an idea of the jokes, the movie begins with clawing happy heart-warming music as Liam Neeson convincingly weeps over his wife's death and calls Emma Thompson for support.  &quot;I didn't know who else to call.&quot;  Thompson replies -- in a humorless performance in a role for which she was horribly miscast-- that she'll call him back sometime because she has to go.  She turns to her little daughter and carries on a &quot;funny&quot; conversation about how her daughter is to play a &quot;lobster&quot; in the school's nativity play.  &quot;I didn't know lobsters were at the nativity!&quot;  Would you laugh?  Finally, a few scenes later, she stops by to see how Neeson is doing.  Again, convincingly, he breaks down crying and sobbing, to which she replies, &quot;Cut it out.  Nobody likes a sissy.&quot;  Look:  I laughed uproariously during the suicide jokes in &quot;About a Boy&quot; but here it's played for laughs, and it's just not funny.If you really haven't seen the movie, then my best advice is that if you loved &quot;Notting Hill,&quot; then you'll enjoy this movie, but if you liked &quot;About a Boy&quot; and didn't like &quot;Notting Hill,&quot; you'll find this one a stinker.	2.0	Another perspective:  no laughs, no romance	2004-05-21	19	15	4

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2887J6P8VPB5H	Nichomachus	"As a fan of romantic comedies, a recurring viewer of MOONSTRUCK and SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, I have an admitted soft spot for these kinds of movies. I wasn't repelled by NOTTING HILL, but mostly I love the old screwball comedies of the Thirties along with the elegant romances of that era.So I'm not being casual, or mere stick-in-the-mud, when I say that LOVE ACTUALLY is one of the worst movies ever made, was insulting, and by its end was physically painful to watch. I literally demanded to my friend that we leave the theatre, and felt a blessed relief after escaping the unceasing sequence of the boy running through Heathrow Airport as swells of glottal muzak was ejaculated from the sound system.While I've survived Heathrow, and understand how running through it would be a mighty undertaking in the best of circumstances, that doesn't mean we need to be subjected to it, and be expected to find it cute and sweet. In this era of terrorism, children running pell-mell through major airports is not a cause for romantic delight. And the movie's near pathological stereotypes of Americans (e.g. hyper-sexed Texan co-eds in small-town Wisconsin winter?) were just plain weird. The writer obviously takes his Playboy ""Girls of the SEC"" issue a bit too seriously.Basically, hack writer/director Richard Curtis seems to have believed he found the perfect formula for the greatest romantic love story of all time. Take every possible romantic plot (tragic loss, young infatuation, mature reconciliation, tantalizing sexuality, shy office relationships, chance encounter, ironic circumstance, illness, naughty infidelity, deeply complex obsession, etc., etc.), mash it all into one over-wrought pandering concoction, simplify each relationship to the barest cliche possible, inject routine amusing coincidences, overdose on a slushy soundtrack, and after a two+ hour stewing you get a small pink paper package filled with Nutrasweet artifical sweetener. That is LOVE ACTUALLY for you.And pandering is the real key here. Pandering not of the highest order, but of the lowest common denominator, as every possible consitutency that can be pandered to IS pandered to by this movie. Begin character sequence, touch on the most banal emotional trigger possible, cut to the next sequence, touch on the most banal emotional trigger possible, cut to the next......repeat cycle to infinity. This is the entirety of the movie.Thus, despite actually having some of the best British film stars (and a few excellent actual American film stars), doing some actually very good acting, there is no way they can save this movie from being what it ACTUALLY is: utter crap. You might as well mainline corn syrup into your aortal vein for all of the ""emotional"" truths supposedly danced before our eyes.If life and love could be reduced to a series of predictable, superficial and cliched episodes--a grand Hallmark card--it certainly wouldn't be worth making a movie about, now would it?"	1.0	Actually, just gawdawful -- the worst romance ever made	2004-08-23	51	26	25
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1129LM24YWSZV	"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw"""	In Love, Actually, a plethora of different story lines explore different types of love: that first crush, unrequited love, love denied, extramarital love (and what it does to a marriage), the obligations of familial love, etc. The movie does this via a host of characters played by some of the most recognizable names in the romantic comedy genre: Hugh Grant, Collin Firth, Laura Linney, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, even Claudia Schiffer, for goodness sakes!The movie is very sweet (be forewarned), but it's also very well done. The performances are wonderful (especially Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson), and the stories of all of the different characters weave pleasingly together at the end, with most story lines reaching some sort of resolution.Note: I would NOT classify this as a family movie. Both nudity and language are evident. However, for adults looking for a sweet, feel-good movie about one of the most basic human emotions (final scenes depicting a young boy racing through an aiport to bid goodbye to the unknowing object of his affection did get me a little misty), this fits the bill nicely.	4.0	Very sweet, actually	2005-06-25	2	2	0
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3QW2FEVNWI9VS	Nicole D.	I should start by saying that I love a good sappy love story - especially around the holidays.  Somehow, in 2013, I hadn't yet seen Love Actually, and I started hearing so much about it on social media.  So, imaging my delight when I saw that it was available on a long flight.  I watched.  And waited for the amazing, lovely, heartwarming parts.  I typically cry at movies all the time.  Even the silly, would-never-really-happen made for TV movies.  I was fully expecting to cry at this one, but didn't shed a single tear.  I found two parts heartwarming (see below - spoiler alert) and that's it.  In fact, the one couple I liked the most had the most anti-climactic storyline of them all.  I was very disappointed and felt that I wasted 2 hours (it's a long movie!!!) that could have been spent re-watching a true holiday love story (e.g., The Holiday, Serendipity, to name a few).  I would not recommend this movie.SPOILER ALERT: I found two parts heartwarming - (1) the opening scene showing people in an airport, (2) the scene where Liam Neeson takes his son to the airport.  The rest fell completely flat for me.	2.0	Disappointing, actually.	2013-12-07	7	2	5

I was so happy he was right about us trampy Americans and our vunerability to the suave English accent...HA!!!  He was so pathetic I wanted him to succeed.  What earns five stars in my book is when the movie is over I want to watch it again right away.  This definitely is it...GREAT MOVIE!!!	5.0	Made me tear up and laugh a lot...	2005-09-29	4	3	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	APXH4EYQ0DIKD	"Nikki S. ""Rockin Chick"""	"This is one of the truly greatest love stories.  I found ""Love Actually"" to be quite refreshing and not the typical predictable love story with a happy ending.  I was amazed at the tempo and the way the movie sectioned off into each fun-filled episodes that was so entertaining and emotionally moving at the same time.  You were never bored or left hanging in the atmosphere of a scene.  The scenes just got better and funnier with each character portrayal.  This movie was very surprising. Like a bag full of treats for everyone.  I watched it several times and enjoyed particularly, the acting of ""Colin Firth"" and ""Hugh Grant"".  These two English actors were never my favorites but after this spectacular movie, I am a fan of both for life.  If you are an  incredibly romantic person and love people portraying real life situations that you can wholly identify with, then this is your movie.  You know a movie is worth watching when you really hate the holiday emphasize but find that it really didn't enter your mind that it was made for Xmas.  You truly would watch it because it is just what it is, a heart-warming adventure on cinema.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3KR9Q99D1EGEB	"Odysseus ""A Traveller"""	"Without doubt, the worst film I have seen in several years.This film is built around approximately 9 subplots, each of which is loosely related to the theme that love takes many forms and can turn up in the most unexpected places.Several of these plots are shallow, one-joke sketches excruciatingly protracted over the course of over two hours.The more involved ones are even more insulting and formulaic. It would be difficult to decide which of them was the worst, but my candidate would be the plot involving Colin Firth.  It is entirely contrived to concoct a ""romantic"" final scene, the details of which I will not disclose here so as not to ""spoil"" (if such a thing could be done for this horrendous film) the plot. But suffice it to say that the film hurls every lame cliche at the screen at the same time -- syrupy music, a contrived final scene, ethnic stereotyping, all to celebrate a ""love"" that, as far as the filmgoer can tell, doesn't really exist.  The film doesn't seem to care about the essence of any particular love story, as much as it does the sorts of manipulative payoff scenes that can get audiences to tear up.If one is going to feel warm and fuzzy, one needs something to feel warm and fuzzy about.  You can't just skip to the climax and expect the viewer to believe in a love that is never really shown developing in any way.The subplot with Hugh Grant may be equally deplorable.  He plays the British PM, but doesn't bother to act, it's rather as though Hugh Grant himself has been installed at 10 Downing Street.  This subplot is insulting on several levels, but perhaps most because of its imbecilic take on international diplomacy.  The Americans are played as sinister rubes, on up to their lascivious President played by Billy Bob Thornton.The subplot with Keira Knightley is supposed to be moving but is instead creepy.  If you think stalking is romantic, you might like that one.The film reaches for the lowest common denominator at every turn, for a length of over two hours.  Awful stuff.  I'm a lover of good romantic comedies, but trust me, this is definitely not one of them.  It's a cliche factory, from start to finish; by the middle, I felt insulted.  By the end, I was incensed.Stay away!"	1.0	Garbage, Actually	2005-12-14	103	56	47

I couldn't understand what this story, or mix of stories had to do with love. I realize I'm old-fashioned, but I am so disappointed that anyone would believe the ideas presented here are healthy, happy concepts of real love.  I'm so weary of films with gratuitous, meaningless sex and meaningless stories. We never looked at the rating beforehand, since this was presented as a Christmas movie.  An R-rated Christmas movie?

It is nothing memorable, just sort of a 2 hour xmas time filler to get ya in the mood.The premise is simple. Various persons each have a crisis love situation around xmas time and then eventually it tries to all come together. There is a lot of diversity in the various stories and it is very moochy, kissy, awww---shucks, kind of stuff. So take your girl to see it and I am sure she will be happy for the next few hours after it, but the film does lash on a bit with the whole emotion of love sort of premise that it is born out from.The scenes with the aging old rocker are worth the admission fee alone.

It's funny, witty, invocative, whatever that means. I love Hugh Jackman (the prime minister) in this film- it's just so classic him! One of the funniest parts is the British guy who has no luck in love in England, so for the holdiays travels to America to ""break the curse""- and it does to great comedic effect! Wish that would happen to me! :) I am not sure if you need this movie in your collection (hence the 4 stars) but it's definately worth a watch, unless you get depressed always seeing others finding love."	4.0	Great chic-flick	2004-10-29	10	2	8

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1WJ8CF0N6LIS3	"pataphysismo ""pataphysismo"""	"Yikes, what a bad movie. If you are expecting another flick on par with this director's own wonderfully hilarious, witty, and touching ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" think again. Saw this for free the week before it came out, and I still came out looking for a fight, even though I didn't spend any of my own money on it--it was that offensive to my not-so-delicate sensibilities. Imagine my surprise, then, when the thing became a well-received blockbuster. I'm no snob--I enjoy trash like ""Big Trouble in Little China"" and smart romantic comedies like ""When Harry Met Sally"" as much as any Kurosawa, Kubrick, or Greenaway flick (okay, I even like a lot of dumb romantic comedies, but don't tell). But this movie is manipulative, derivative crap. Its handful of good early moments eventually become baffling oddities in a sea of dreck; it's difficult to imagine how such imaginative people (director and actors alike) could ever approach the idiotic words they're saying, situations they're enacting, and emotions they're prostituting with any degree of seriousness. I mean, don't they go to the movies anymore? Don't they realize that this movie apes a hundred other better and even lesser flicks? That they're insulting us by asking us to feel genuine emotions for their idiotic characters and situations? If this were a straight comedy, I probably wouldn't feel so insulted; but no, this movie wants us to feeeel it, brothers and sisters! Let me sum it up: any movie that takes the potential comedic gold of a Prime Minister Hugh Grant vs. President Billy Bob Thorton matchup and attempts to turn it into, gasp, a serious dramatic situation doesn't deserve to be seen (by the way, I won't criticize the jingoism of this particular subplot; anti-Americanism is fine, as long as its funny and smart and more or less self-deprecating--fer instance, Monty Python were the most America-bashing limeys on the planet for a while there, but I and a million other fans laughed ourselves sick anyway)."	1.0	blech; don't believe the hype	2004-09-29	34	16	18

This is really several stories which connect each other by the theme of love.  We watch it every Christmas but this would make a very good Valentine's movie.  The acting is superb!

I have watched it three or four times, and I always end up smiling.  There are several stories intertwined among a group of people which might be described as being related through ""six degrees of separation"", i.e. somebody knows somebody knows somebody.  Curtis has showed imagination in including a couple who meets as they perform as ""body doubles"" and another young man who visits the U.S. to look for his own kind of gold and strikes it rich.  There are several resolutions, and a couple of relationships where the viewer is left wondering what is going to happen - the 40 something couple who has reached a fork in the road, the young woman who may lose the love of her life because of family responsibilities and the young man who, out of respect for his best friend, did not speak of his love for the friends girlfriend until it is almost too late.  This situation is rather odd, and one wonders how it will turn out.  The rocker is wonderful even though it is a sterotype of the rock star of the 60s still playing in his 60s.  One of the reviewers said the story plot was confusing; I don't agree.

It takes the psychological threads and complexities of relationship and weaves a wonderful tapestry that illuminates the human condition while it entertains.  I laughed many times during this movie and other times was nearly moved to tears.  It is an excellent movie to revisit at Christmas time and it is complex enough that it can stand up to repeated veiwing.  The acting and writing is also suberb and it has the flavor of a good foreign film blended with the best characteristics of a U.S. film.  At the price they are selling this film for, it's totally worth the risk to buy it if you haven't seen it.  It's heartwarming... engaging... and delightful in every way.  You won't be disappointed unless you are looking for very light entertainment with little substance (which there is a place for in my book as well).	5.0	Excellent movie that considers holds the human condition with seriousness and humor	2006-11-21	4	4	0

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2ODBHT4URXVXQ	"Peggy Vincent ""author and reader"""	This was a fun movie - flawed only by taking on the lives and loves of a few too many people. It's a romantic comedy in which there's a happy ending for about 12 of the 16 people involved as they careen into the stress and chaos of the Christmas holidays.Another stretch is accepting Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister; I'm sorry, but he just doesn't look the part, nor does his endearing, hesitant, bumbling persona lend itself well to the role of a world leader. HOWEVER, there's a scene in which he thinks he's alone and he's dancing all over #10 Downing to recorded music, and he's really laying on some hotshot moves - - - and suddenly there's a staff member-secretary-middle-aged-woman-person type standing in the doorway with a sheaf of papers. It's terrific. I replayed it 3 times and laughed just as hard the 3rd time as I had the 1st.Emma Thompson has a scene that's difficult to do justice to in words, and indeed, the scene is wordless. On Christmas morning, she realizes her husband (smarmy Alan Rickman) has a lover, and she leaves her family to go to her bedroom where she quietly, wordlessly, and eloquently regains control of her devastation.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A13DQTXG02HZC1	Ping Lim	One word that comes to my mind upon describing Richard Curtis' movie is charming.  His works are always understated but seemed to evoke emotions that other Hollywood movies won't do.  As viewers might have guessed already, this movie is about love; love in all sorts of shapes and forms; love that transcends language, culture, & border; unspoken love, love that is to be confused with lust; puppy love; endearing love, the kind of love that would last a lifetime and beyond; love of the same sex. et cetera.  Richard Curtis attempted to cover as much love as possible in this movie but as he said in the additional features in DVD, the movie length came to a staggering 3 hours 20 minutes.  Naturally, some scenes needed to be edited to much his disappointment as some scenes were his personal favourites & which I personally think should be included in the original movie itself.  Anyway, this is a very subjective view.  There were talks about how the soundtrack came about in the movie and the complexity of matching them with the length of the scenes which almost never worked out as planned.  I needn't say more.  Should you enjoy his previous writings such as Notting Hill, Four Weddings & A Funeral, you would love this movie actually!  All actors and actresses in this movie are brilliant.  Highly recommended.  It encompasses what's truly essential and what's sorely lacking in this world today, LOVE in a very big way.  As John Lennon & Yoko Ono sang, all we need is love.  DVD is definitely a better way to go to appreciate this movie in its full glory.	4.0	Breathless	2004-06-20	4	3	1

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3DKWA7V6FKENE	"""pitchtg12"""	Love Actually is sure to be a light hearted classic.  In the same vein as Sleepless in Seattle or You've Got Mail, Love Actually is full of many heart warming stories that overlap eachother.  The film is pretty much a complete collection of every kind of love story there is.  What i liked about the film was that the writers didn't try to make them all have a happy ending although most of them did.  This is a film to pop in your vcr or dvd player when having a bad day.  If for nothing else than to watch the adorable little kid in his quest for love.  The movie is essentially exactly what you would predict but that doesn't take away from the cuteness of the film.  Probably the only problem that I had with it was the inconsistency of the relationships of the characters.  It was almost as if some of them were friends in the beginning of the film and then the writers forgot that at the end.  Also I think that this is not really a movie for little kids.  While it wouldn't hurt them to watch it I am pretty sure they will not understand the majority of the film.  But other than that this film was very good and will surely put a smile on any viewers face.	4.0	Lovely  Love  Actually	2004-04-15	0	0	0

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1TPW86OHXTXFC	"prisrob ""pris,"""	'Love Actually' is one of my favorite Christmas films, next to 'The National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. 'Love Actually' is a sometimes silly, romantic film where dozens (it seems like) of couples fall in and out of love.The film centers around people who are sometimes connected. Hugh Grant plays the Prime Minister of Britain, his sister, Emma Thompson married to a philandering jerk, Alan Ricker. The PM, Hugh Grant, is all alone, too busy for love until he meets an attractive food aide on his first day in office. Billy Bob Thorton, plays the President of the United States, who gets his comeuppance from the Britain's PM.Liam Neeson plays a good friend of Emma Thompson, whose wife recently died, and he is the step father to such a cute young boy who is in love with a young exchange student from the US. Colin Firth finds his wife playing around with his brother, he goes abroad and meets a young woman who cleans and cooks for him. Neither speaks the other's language. And, then, the best part, Billy Mack, an older, much older musician played by Bill Nighy , looking for love in all the wrong places.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1634ZLFN36LN5	"""prizo24601"""	this is quite possibly my favorite romantic comedy ever.  this movie starts off with a bang and continues that way throughout the entire movie!  it focuses on multiple people and never loses its edge throughout the entire romp.  instead of losing us in the multiple characters, they are all rich and developed to their fullest.hugh grant plays a loveable (as always) english prime minister who finds himself pining over one of his assistants.  colin firth plays the best role i have ever seen him in!  he is absolutely great in this movie.  he plays a writer who has just lost his love.  into his life steps a housekeeper who can't even speak his language.  the on-screen chemistry between these two is outstanding as they show how love crosses even language barriers.liam neeson's character is my personal favorite in this movie.  he plays a character whose wife has just died.  he is left alone with his step-son as they try to cope with this loss.  liam and his counterpart (wonderfully played by thomas sangster) move throughout this movie with a grace and charm that is hard to find in modern movie cinema.  liam tries to teach sam about love and winning a girl.  some of their parts actually brought tears to my eyes (which rarely happens).  they teach how a step-son and step-father can love each other and help each other through the hardships of life.other great turns in this movie include emma thompson as a wife starving for the love of her husband, sienna guillory as the housekeeper to colin's writer, bill nighy as an aged rockstar trying to make a comeback, and keira knightly as a recently married young woman.if this movie doesn't cause you to feel something, then i would have to believe that you are dead inside.  if you are looking for a wonderful look at how love actually exists, look no further!!!	5.0	one of the best romantic comedies ever!!!	2004-02-23	4	3	1

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2QK7SB0J3NG59	"readernyc ""readernyc"""	"This film can be critiqued in many ways. But for me, it is a love high, a great series of intertwining stories, wonderful music, perfect cuts between the ten or so story lines withsome of the finest actors alive: Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, the divine Colin Firth, Leem Neison playing a window five years before his actual wife's death, a boy who is making it huge in films obiously a born actor.So as one who rarely watches kitchy films I sure do watch ""Love, Actually"" a lot. As said, since 2003, I've seen it over a hundred times. Do any of the scenes get stale? Yes a few for sure. But the acting is amazing and a must see is the DVD's second side where the boy and Hugh Grant and the Shakeperian rock musician all combine in cuts that add to the interest. Laura Linney and the most famed and gorgeous Brazilian actor too, a class of actors including Billy Bob Thorton, perfectly realized, makes this wonderful because the actors to a person are top notch.Then again, it's the romantic in me that so loves the many happy endings and the few unhappy ones are hard on the heart-- but that is life. I also love the first and last scenes of real people at Heathrow Airport. Everyone I know has a favorite film for a lonely night or a loving night and many choose ""Pretty Woman"" but I choose, LOVE, ACTUALLY.""The cynics among you should not expect a single cynical note here. And hats off to the director. Richard, for the amazing musical cuts. The other side of this DVD isn't perfect but for we non-British, it turns out the many of the minor roles are filled by major stars not usually seen state side. Thank you for listening.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3QYNHBE43WA3C	Real Writer	So..............the British now make films as badly as the Americans.  I have not been this disappointed with a major studio release in years.  The director took far too many characters, watered down their storylines so they had about 10 minutes screen time each, accompanied them with music of the heartstrings, and attempted to wrap it up nicely with a Christmas wreath.What an embarrassing waste of talent.  The only bright spot in this film is the marvelous talent of Emma Thompson.  Her crying scene, accompanied by Joni Mitchell, makes you want her to make more films!  The wonderful Laura Linney, Liam Neeson and Colin Firth are all under utilized in this sad hodgepodge.  Please do not read the other reviews that promise you a wonderful holiday movie.  I am as sentimental as the next guy but you knew where this film was going in the first ten minutes.  And even then, characters were never allowed to resolve any of their dilemmas.What drivel!

The story had a lot going on but I never found myself lost.  THe stories are plausible and real.  I just didn't get the whole porn story.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2HLWI96XCT0EY	Reviewer	"Like many reviewers here, I am a fan of most of actors and Richard Curtis's previous films. Though there are hints of good acting here and there, and some funny and clever moments, overall the film left me with an uneasy feeling. I liked it enough to buy the DVD when it came out, but as I watched it I started to realize how much has changed in Britain and society since Four Weddings and A Funeral came out. What this film really is, is a baby boomer/Richard Curtis 'fantasy' about how Britain should be: irreverent, multicultural, highly sexual (even children), shallow and nihilistic. In the director's commentary Curtis hints that he didn't make that decision himself. He comments how there were many, loud complaints about the lack of minority characters in his previous films. Here it's blunt, clumsy in your face miscegenation, carefully color coded characters, happy never never land diversity. There is nothing wrong with 'ideals' but these are more like political messages, and so out of touch with reality suspension of disbelief is difficult.Curtis also creates a 'fantasy' prime minister that actually speaks up about the failure American foreign policy, but he can't take himself too seriously, and in essence, Curtis unwillingly shows why Britain cannot standup for herself; She has lost her confidence in being British and doesn't believe Englishness is anything special.Others have commented on the inappropriateness of the child romance - an elementary school kid having a lusty sexual conversation with his step father. ""rock stars shag chicks"" ... I couldn't believe it, but then I realized its a perfect reflection of what the current elite in Britian and the US want for our society.I also believe that since the success and attraction of the very 'English"" previous films, Curtis was pressured to make them more multicultural and less English. Again, the commentary, Curtis unwittingly alludes to that.The highlights of this film, I think was the romance between Firth and Portuguese maid (though frankly shallow and unbelievable, I suppose like many middle aged men I am willing to suspend disbelief :) ) , and the haunting beautiful soundtrack.I personally believe that what we watch for 'entertainment' profoundly effects us, and I believe the overall 'message' of this film is bad for the soul."	2.0	Useful for other reasons	2011-12-14	8	4	4

Richard Curtis has put together a fine film, showing the foibles of human nature, and the characters' reactions. I laughed often, reflected softly, and ultimately thought it is a treasure among those films that talk about ""love"". The stellar cast handles the material well, especially Bill Nighy, the over-the-hill rock singer. Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, Emma Thompson, and Colin Firth are all excellent.  It's very episodic, and the episodes with Mr. Firth are especially sweet. ""Love Actually"" won many awards, worldwide, but was ignored by the Academy. I laughed often, reflected quite a bit, and was allowed to put myself in touch with these wonderful characters. ALL love, or infatuation, is an enigma, and the ""porn"" couple really put it in perspective. I loved those two. Also, Neeson's son (I don't know his name) is one of the best kid-actors I've seen in a long time. It's a good ride, and loads of fun. Check it out!"	5.0	Love is all around...	2008-06-02	4	2	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AUA64NQ3X56OJ	Richard Nelson	If you enjoy romantic comedies, it's hard to imagine that you won't enjoy this one. If you're an Anglophile, it's even harder: Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, and Liam Neeson take turns on screen throughout the movie. So if you're just looking for a pick-me-up, or a romantic movie night, search no more. Here it is.With that said, Richard Curtis goes a bit overboard here--and the DVD extras reveal that he wanted to go even further. The movie juggles at least eight subplots; is it any wonder Curtis had a hard time cutting it down to two hours and 15 minutes? A few subplots are clearly meant as comic relief of a sort; I particularly liked the couple that met while working as body doubles for a movie, an occupation that required them to spend long periods of time simulating all manner of sex acts with one another; when they finally fall for one another (this gives away nothing in this movie, by the way--the plots are pretty much telegraphed to the audience in the first ten minutes) they experience awkwardness just kissing. It's a sly commentary on culture and a funny moment at the same time.Other subplots are sadder; Liam Neeson's wife dies at the start of the film, and he deals with his own grief and that of his stepson mostly on his own. And while it's clear that Alan Rickman will eventually succumb to the temptation of his secretary--even Emma Thompson, who plays his wife, warns him about her--it isn't clear until the end that he'll do so in a way that raises and then devastates his wife.Which brings us to the primary fault with the film: the ending. There are a great many happy moments, including the wrap of the Colin Firth subplot (another one that starts out sadly), but there are also many loose ends left untied. After witnessing the devastation of Emma Thompson, we get a 15-second outro from her subplot that tells us nothing about how she and Alan Rickman dealt with his infidelity. A subplot involving Keira Knightley wraps clumsily, with Curtis asking us to accept that one kiss from a married woman can quell an obsession and make everything right. The whole thing races to close within the allotted time, as if Curtis is fearful his audience will have to leave for the bathroom if he lingers any longer.This should have been a high-profile mini-series. Really. There's nothing about it that demands the movie theatre screen, and Curtis clearly had enough plot to fill six or seven hours if he tried. The footage he left out and shows on the DVD would have made for a better movie, and the loose ends he leaves could have been wrapped up more effectively given more time.Alas, that's not what happened. Don't get me wrong: you'll enjoy this movie. The airport scenes at the start and end of the movie, showing ordinary people embracing their loved ones as they arrive at the gate, will make you smile at the beginning and probably prolong your happy tears at the end. But when you stop to think about it afterward, you'll wish you could have stayed with these characters longer and known more about them. Curtis could have given you that, too.	4.0	Anglophile's Dream	2004-06-18	4	2	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2H9UO8RYFX5MB	"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich"""	&quot;Love Actually&quot; is not a complex film, nor is it a terribly deep film. Nevertheless, it accomplishes its goal of expressing, in simple (but not simplistic) terms some of the different kinds of love people experience in life. It begins with the message &quot;Love, actually, is all around&quot; and it maintains that course throughout the film.Among the many different types of love the film covers are first love, new love, seasoned love, love on the rocks, frustrated love, unexpressed love, unrequited love, love between strangers, love between friends, love between parent and child, love between brother and sister, platonic love, dangerous love, and of course, lots and lots of romantic love. It doesn't explore any of these in a particularly deep fashion, but we do get the variety of experiences and feelings that can be labelled under that most simple name: love.The film is carried by an excellent soundtrack, a compliation of great songs including a soulful number by Norah Jones and one of Dido's best songs, and some well-turned performances by some really great actors. While you won't see Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, or Liam Neeson at their dramatic best, you will see some solid, believeable performances from each of these and the many other folks in the film. The actors alone make this movie worth watching.In the end, take the movie for what it is... not too serious, not too deep, but attempting to express one of the simplest and most basic of themes: &quot;Love, actually, is all around.&quot;In such times as these, I can live with that. In fact, I rather enjoyed it.	4.0	Love, Simply	2004-05-23	3	2	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5	R. Kyle	"""Love, Actually"" could have been titled ""Love, Almost"" with an American director.  With new fewer than eight couples vying for attention in this cameo-laden romantic comedy, you need a score card to keep up--and yes, everyone does win, more or less.We start at the top, brand new Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) just moves in to fall in love with the girl who brings him coffee. Liam Neeson is helping his grade school stepson win the heart of the very young woman he loves. Emma Thompson is on the bittersweet end as she tries to wrap her head around the idea that her husband, Alan Rickman might be cheating with an office girl.And that's not all...The stories are heartfelt with just enough British irony to keep you laughing instead of falling into a sucrose induced coma.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AR1AE3HSCR1TM	Robert J. Morris	"I cannot believe the same guy wrote ""Four Weddings . .""  Enough uncomfortable and unlikely relationships here to write a book, but none so egregious as the plot thread about the shy porn actors.  Yes, every now and then we get sixty to ninety seconds of two sweet and unassuming porn actors grinding or bumping or orally gratifying while establishing a ""cute"" relationship which includes a sexless, nearly Victorian, romance.  Yeah, sure.Liam Neeson's character buries his wife at the start of the movie in a funeral scene unabashedly swiped from ""The Big chill"".  Somebody should tell screenwriter Curtis that unexpected rock music works at the end of a funeral when it's unexpected and by the Stones, not planned and from the Bay City Rollers.  The gone-too-soon Mom's ten-or-under boy mourns not his late mother, but his unrequited love for the class hotty.  And the cute kid (who curses cutely too) is thrilled when his Dad seems interested in a new chick before Mom's body has fully cooled - a nice touch.Hugh Grant as Prime Minister?  Hah!  I'll buy that when you convince me that Billy Bob Thornton could play a President.  Well, actually, we are asked to believe the perennially 28-year-old Grant is PM; and Billy Bob is typecast as the pushy (Bush?) pig (Clinton?) of an American President.  The whole idea, right down to the PM falling for a Monica Lewinsky look-alike, just doesn't work.  Will someone kindly inform the Brits that Clinton didn't really love Lewinsky.Speaking of informing the Brits:  Please tell English comedy writers that Americans do not 'get' Rowan Atkinson, hence a scene does not automatically become funny when he turns around and faces the camera.While I'm at it:  Alan Rickman's character shows a ton of intelligence and sensitivity in trying to help Laura Linney's character land the man she loves.  That's nice.  But guys that thoughtful and sensitive do not leave brilliant, beautiful, and loving wives like Emma Thompson for air-headed Catherine Zeta-Jones wannabes.  For Zeta-Jones they leave, not the wannabes.  Make a note, if Catherine will not take the part you write it out.  And while you're rewriting you can let Laura Linney keep her top on, she's too good an actress.  Talk about gratuitous.Curtis tries to tie all eight romances together at the end with one of those airport greeting scenes originally done by Saturday Night Live in 1977.  It doesn't work, most of these plot threads relate just too loosely - and the porn actors are kinda free-floating.  Why are they in the movie anyway?A second star, however, because the acting is excellent - most of the stars rise above the story lines.  And Thompson's character is indeed well-written as well as well-acted.  Rickman is great, as is Linney, and Bill Nighy is fun as a burned out rock star. Finally, the 1/10 or so of the movie devoted to Colin Firth and Lucia Moniz (his housekeeper) is warm and funny, and could have used much more time.Unfortunately, if you've seen the trailer you've seen about every fun scene in the flick.  Avoid this one."	2.0	Tasteless in London	2004-12-12	21	8	13
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3E5HJLW98H7ZX	"Robestown Pundit ""Robestown Pundit"""	While it did have a few (very few) endearing qualities, this movie was a huge disappointment. I'd even call it repugnant. I watched it because it was on two online lists of best romantic comedies and because Colin Firth is in it.Most of the characters were not even likable--like the step-dad who curses with his young step-son and cultivates in the boy a consumeristic attitude toward girls at the pre-pubescent age of eleven. Then there's the guy who confesses to his best friend's new wife that he's in love with her. A cheating husband (ever more inflammatory because he's cheating on the character played by the always charming Emma Thompson), a British Prime Minister with an eye for much younger, socially servile women and a sister enslaved to her brother's mental illness round out this bloated cast of fetid characters. The one decent male character is played by Colin Firth. His relationship is lovely and romantic, but it's such a small fraction of the whole story that the movie is a total loss anyway.One of the biggest stinking sores of this story was the couple who met and fell in love while performing together in a porn flick. Anybody who knows anything about the reality of porn knows that women porn performers are kept high and surrounded by &#34;handlers&#34; (a euphemism for specialized pimps) and that there is no freedom or dignity in the industry for women, or men for that matter. The breezy treatment of the porn industry in this film is not only despicable, it's fosters and promotes the deception that the porn industry is anything but evil and exploitive of women.There were ZERO strong women in this film. Every female character was stuck in vortex of the narcissism of an immature, self-centered man. I hated it and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. In fact, I'd give it a negative score if I could.	1.0	Misogyny Dominates Story	2013-02-24	44	23	21

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1BRXLFWILNICE	Robin McDonald	Love Actually was one of my favorite films of the year.While some of the stories began to crumble around the edges near the end, it was never the less endearing and sentimental. Exactly the kind of film you want to watch around the holidays.As much as I loved all the stories I dearly wish they could release a double disc with a toned down version. Even though I did enjoy the story with the couple who meets rehearsing for the actors in a porn movie, it spoils the potential to watch the film with kids and in my case, the older parents as well who would really enjoy everything else. A friend said they saw such a version on an airplane flight and it didn't take away from the pleasure of the film in the slightest. Ordinarily I would never make such a request of a movie. But this film is so delightful and would be a wonderful perennial family favorite (...). I'd watch the film as is for myself. But I would love to share it.I think they would do well to make a rare exception in this case take advantage of the DVD format to offer a PG-13 cut without that storyline.This is a special movie, special case scenario, not a puritanical rant. I have heard others voice a similar sentiment. If this is the case for you maybe give this review a helpful vote to nudge the studio into releasing a special edition package. I am going to cross my fingers and wait and hope they release such a version in November.	4.0	My Grownup  Christmas Wish	2004-04-16	8	8	0

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A392WLAMBV6TF1	"Rochambeau Fan ""AJ"""	"As I write this review and look at the calendar, I wonder why, for once, I am not dreading the arrival of the holidays.  I usually do not look forward to them with all their chaos, confusion and tiresome ceremonies.  And yet, after recently seeing ""Love Actually,"" I suddenly have changed my tune!This is a testament to what is truly one of the finest Christmas films of all time.  ""Love Actually"" is shamelessly touching and endearing. It takes chances and liberties with its plot all the time, but it is done so well and acted so credibly that it all comes together perfectly.That excellent acting is brought to you by some of England's (and the world's!) top actors: Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth & Alan Rickman (to name just 5!!!).  While it's amazing to have all these A-list stars in one film, what's even more impressive is that there is no one star, per se.  This is an ensemble piece in the truest sense of the word.Brought to us by the same folks that brought classics like FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL & BRIDGET JONE'S DIARY, this film contains the same type of offbeat, oddly touching and sometimes dicey British humor.Critics may claim that the film is uneven, too sugary-sweet, and too mature to be the ideal ""feel-good holiday film"" it strives to be. But all this is neither here nor there.LOVE ACTUALLY is the ideal Christmas gift for one and all.  You will leave the theater with a warm, fuzzy feeling that no other film in recent memory will leave you with.In short, this is a Romantic/Holiday comedy done the way only the Brit's could do it- oddball, screwy, offbeat and thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish."	5.0	A Touching & Heartwarming Christmas Treat	2003-11-10	2	1	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1FPFWDC1ASYNJ	Rodrigo Llamozas	Richard Curtis, the writer and director of Love actually, also wrote Four weddings and a funeral, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones's diary, so it should come as no surprise that this is a feel good movie from start to end.The particular difference between Love actually and those other movies is the fact that instead of following one story, we meet more than 10 individual stories that sometimes cross each other. All of them are love stories, all different and all particular to each character's life, but in the end, they all spin around love.There's Hugh Grant in one of the years most inspired castings, as the new Prime Minister, who falls in love at first sight with one of his assistants (Martine McCutcheon). There's Colin Firth as a man who finds love after he finds he's wife cheating on him. There's Liam Neeson as the widowed step-father of a young boy suffering from unrequited love. There's Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman as a married couple going through the motions. There's Martin Freeman and Joanna Page as a couple who meet in one of the weirdest ways ever (and I do mean EVER). There's Andrew Lincoln and Chiwetel Ejiofor and Keira Knightley as a couple of newlyweds and their best friend. There's Kris Marshall as one of the biggest losers in the love department who figures he needs to go to America to use his british accent as a hook to get girls. There's Bill Nighy as an over-the-hill rock star who manages to get himself one last Christmas hit (and, quite probably, the funniest character in the whole movie). There's Laura Linney as a lonely american woman who's been forever in love with a co-worker. And finally, there's a whole bunch of cameos that I won't spoil for you.Love actually is truly one of those movies from which you come out in love with love. It's fresh, it's funny, it's romantic, it's sad, it's all of those things that love is to all of us.It does have a few minor problems, particularly with some of the pacing. Too many story lines will do that. Also, there are times when you wish a little more time be devoted to some of the stories instead of others. Some are too short for the viewer to have time to connect with the characters.Despite this little misgivings, Love actually is a warm, funny film and a great date movie that you should share with a loved one, not only during the Christmas holidays, but throughout all the year.	4.0	Love is all around us - 4,5 stars!	2004-04-06	17	14	3
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"The half dozen or so love stories that comprise ""Love Actually"" are neither highly dramatic nor emotionally earth-shattering in nature - and I suspect that this is exactly how writer/directer Richard Curtis intended it to be.  This epic paean to the glory of romance involves, for the most part, run-of-the-mill (albeit middle or upper middle class) Londoners just trying to find a little happiness for themselves in the arms of that one true love.Hugh Grant, as the newly elected Prime Minister of England, unskilled in the ways of romance, leads a large and gifted cast through this roundelay of love, actors of no less a stature than Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney, Alan Rickman, Billy Bob Thornton and Rowan Atkinson, just to name a few.  They all portray characters in various states of romantic upheaval.  Some are headed towards blissful, happily-ever-after endings, while others suffer the pangs of jealousy, infidelity and unrequited love.  The best thing about ""Love Actually"" is that it doesn't take itself too seriously and it isn't afraid to take its time introducing and developing its large roster of characters.  The film, as a whole, has the kind of unhurried, laidback charm that one expects from a movie with Grant in the lead.  The worst thing about the film is its over reliance on those fairy tale ""only in the movies"" moments that seem to be an integral part of virtually every romantic comedy that comes down the pike these days (there`s a scene set in Wisconsin that is so lacking in basic credibility that I was absolutely positive it would turn out to be a dream of one of the characters.  It didn`t).  The film culminates in a jaw-droppingly bad scene near the end in which a young boy crashes through airport security with full approval of his beaming stepfather so that the tyke can tell a little classmate of his who is boarding a plane that he loves her.  The sequence is a bit tough to take in this post-9/11 world, especially when the violins start swelling, cuing our tear ducts to well up in approval for this horrific stunt.  There's also a bit of gratuitous America-bashing in Thornton`s portrayal of the President of the United States, a  rather mean spirited diversion in a film whose tone is otherwise all sweetness-and-light.  It's perfectly fine for American films to portray the president as a venal, lecherous bully, but it takes a certain amount of gall for a British film to do so.""Love Actually"" suffers the fate of many films that attempt to write large on too broad a canvas;  some of the characters and stories inevitably turn out to be more involving and compelling than others.  That is simply the nature of the beast.  I certainly wish that the troubled marriage of Rickman and Thompson could have been explored in more depth, since Thompson provides the few moments of genuine feeling and heartbreak in the movie.  And certainly one or two of the other lesser stories could have been dropped from the lineup with little or no harm done to the film overall.  Given that limitation, however, it must be stated that ""Love Actually"" succeeds more often than it fails.  This is partly because the cast is so appealing and partly because much of the writing is really very funny.  The choice of background music is occasionally obvious, though the songs frequently make wry and witty commentary on the action taking place on screen.""Love Actually"" is definitely a long movie (135 minutes to be exact) and it does leave a few loose ends untied at the closing credits.  But that, perhaps, is as it should be.  Life, after all, leaves some loose ends untied as well."	3.0	flawed but entertaining romantic comedy (some spoilers)	2004-09-19	4	3	1

It is a great movie for Christmas, with warm fuzzies, Christmas carols and doing things ""just because its Christmas.""The movie follows a few different relationships as they progress around the Christmas holidays.  First loves, newly-weds, older married couple, new loves, friendships, loves lost, and doomed loves are all in the story line.  It is a little complicated at some points, jumping from character to character, but watch it a second time and you'll catch  more things.  I love the fact that you can watch it over and over and each time find some new angle or idea that you overlooked the first time around.  There is some nudity and profanity which explains the R-rating it was given.  Hence, it is not a movie for young children.  The soundtrack picked out is perfect for this movie and follows beautifully with the storyline.  The large array of highly talented actors and actresses makes this a top-rate movie.What I really love about this movie is that not everyone ""gets the girl"" in the end.  Everyone does not get their happily ever after, but this is what makes the movie more believable and more applicable to the title.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2Y870S7P44V4C	"R.S. ""highlandbob"""	"This is a ""love it or hate it"" movie if I've ever seen one.  And I'll say this now to get it out of the way:  the 8 component stories do at times feel rushed and unfinished, Hugh Grant doesn't pass as particularly impressionable as the PM and Bill Nighy (""Billy Mack"") can't sing worth a crap.  Despite all that, however, I loved this movie.I think the 8 mixed stories intertwine well to witness the full spectrum of how love can build us up or tear us apart.  And we see love at different levels and stages, from Sam's infatuation with a classmate to newlyweds to Harry's near-infidelity.  Many complaints revolve around the assertion that the stories are too far-fetched... but hey, if you can't ""let go"" somewhat when you watch a movie you may as well not watch any movies ever.The movie is also a very good comedy; to me it's even more comedy than romance.  I am a huge fan of British comedy and this film has a very British sensibility.  It has a warm ""real"" feeling to it that the average Hollywood production lacks.  Adding to that is the beginning and closing series of video clips showing people reuniting at Heathrow and showing that ""love actually is all around.""Another factor to a great, memorable movie -- a subliminal factor, if you will -- is the music.  And this movie features some fantastic music; from the classics ""Jump (for My Love)"" and ""God Only Knows"" to Olivia Olson's admirable performance of ""All I Want for Christmas is You"" to the uplifting main theme.The only downfall that I would have corrected if I had the chance would be to make it another 20 minutes longer, to the end of developing certain segments further.  Nonetheless, I have watched it several times on HBO and have recommended it to my friends because it has become one of my favorite recent movies.Lastly, I feel compelled to address the negative comments:  many of those people must have been sorely burned to the point that they can't even enjoy a movie about our most influential emotion.  And some are just wacky -- did you read the one by ""germania""?  Thankfully, most people are not as stone-hearted."	5.0	The perspectives on this are amazing	2005-04-21	4	3	1

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1W4LS4UHH63W3	"Ryan Thomas ""Magazine Editor"""	Well, as a man who was dragged to this film by my girlfriend  on the same day we saw Kill Bill, I hate that I actually liked it more than the latter.  Men are supposed to take blood and violence over smooching middle-aged paradigms, not  have our sensitive sides manipulated by touching storylines. I have let down my forefathers!  Reluctantly I admit that the film is incredibly good, and any man who doesn't walk away with a somewhat renewed sense of hope for relationships and love is a very bitter man indeed.The movie focuses on a series of relationships in various stages of growth, with the majority of them in infant stages --the exceptions would be Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman's marriage and Liam Neeson's struggle with widowhood (that's not a spoiler, the movie opens with it) Some are more prominant than others, and while I expected that each would in someway be related to the other, some of them, in a very unconvetional way, stood alone. A few of them could have been cut out as they are a bit underdeveloped, but all of them are worth following and are very charming. (Just dropped another rung on the masculinaty ladder with that statement.)Ther'se been some hype about the nudity in the film. As a man, ha ha, I had no problem with it. But, in terms of gratuity, I think it serves its purpose, because these are poeple dealing with lust as much as love. There are some scenes where two film stand-in charatcers are asked to engage in faux sexual activity in the nude, but when you include it in the film's premise of how some people meet, it works as an amusing adult situation, not porn. It's funny, it's quirky, if you're offended then you're probably not getting the joke.Anyway, my final comment is to add that Liam Neeson's father/son story is worth seeing this movie for alone. I found myself routing for this little boy the way i route for the Red Sox.	4.0	I didn't mind the nudity	2003-12-04	10	8	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A32XW50ILWOXNO	Samuel McKewon	"Writer-director Richard Curtis intends his Christmas-themed, indulgently operatic ""Love Actually"" to be an Altmanesque tour of comic romance dashed with London wit. It is and it isn't: While a handful of the dozen or so couplings produce funny, poignant scenes, others border on insult, and never does the ensemble piece come together in its entirety. British humor is more literate, but, in many cases, no less shameless.The movie is so protracted and bracketed into segments you can divide it into categories:Terribly good: Hugh Grant, as usual, as the British Prime Minister sweet on his buxom, foul-mouthed catering manager (Martine McCutcheon). While their attraction is quite like a president/intern tryst with which we're all so familiar, Grant is such a daft fool we don't mind. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman accurately portray a married couple rocked by infidelity. Though others may groan at it, I liked a bit story about a good guy who loves his best friend's new wife (Keira Knightley). Ditto for the aging rocker (Bill Nighy) who recaptures the pop charts with an ugly ""Christmas"" remake of an old tune.A Bit Sordid: The story of a luckless-in-love American woman (Laura Linney) saddled with a mentally ill brother - who, uh, also happens to be in London - is better suited to its own story. Liam Neeson is good as a widow whose young stepson has fallen in love, but Curtis takes the sugar too far.Bloody awful: A ludicrous cross-cultural romance between a crime writer (Colin Firth) and his Portugeuse maid, and an awkward, stupid meet cute of body doubles on a film set. Both, however, are trumped by British geek's quest to bed sex crazed American women.""Love Actually"" is loaded with odd quirks. Black actors are cast throughout the movie as sidekicks in an obsequious, almost proplike manner, and Curtis digs on fat people with no particular point in mind. A subplot involving Grant's PM and a creepy American president (Billy Bob Thornton, entirely unconvincing) is heavyhanded. And one of the body doubles is a disturbing lookalike of Mia Farrow in ""Rosemary's Baby.""Curtis, who wrote ""Notting Hill"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", is talented, but his arrogance peeks through, and his directing doesn't play away from it. In certain moments, the movie projects something resmebling disgust.And yet the other moments, the good zingers, are worth a single viewing. Grant caroling. Thompson, putting together her husband's imperfections to a Joni Mitchell song. Rowan Atkinson in a snappy little cameo as a fastidious department store clerk. A scene where Knightley's character ""gets it."" Now that Curtis has the bravado out of his system, his sophomore directing effort should be more focused on those kinds of moments, and less fixated on delivering the world a giant love letter."	3.0	"A British ""good, bad and ugly"" for the holidays."	2003-11-23	0	0	0

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A26WVK274IA7DN	Sarah Bellum	"This film bills itself as ""The Ultimate Romantic Comedy,"" which tells me the filmmakers were striving to pull out all the stops and include everything one could ever want in such a movie. This film does contain everything that has ever made a romantic comedy successful, though this goal ultimately proves too ambitious. The writing, acting and direction are all first rate and are not to be faulted. Really what prevents it from achieving its goal is the sheer number of story lines; no fewer than seven stories are told concurrently. While these are easy enough to follow, not enough time is spent on each to allow us to invest ourselves emotionally in the characters. This is too bad really because each story is interesting enough to warrant its own movie. Perhaps the filmmakers thought otherwise, or perhaps they simply wanted to force as many things as possible into this, following the strategy that more is better. Whatever they were thinking, the result is a disjointed film that is slightly disappointing because it leaves us wanting to know more about each storyline. (This is especially true of the adult film actors, whose story is so briefly shown that it seems almost like an afterthought that is thrown in to show some skin)  In this way, it is similar to a television series, which shows a little bit of each storyline each week. With a TV series, however, we know it will be back the following week with more plot development. Not so here. Even though the ending brings it all together, it is done rather sloppily. As it turns out, nearly everyone in the movie knows everyone else or is related in some way. How coincidental! This is entirely unnecessary and reminds me of films that tie all the characters together well at the end. Nonetheless, the film has some genuinely funny (love that British humor) and earnestly heartfelt moments, and I did enjoy watching it. It might be fun to see separate movies of each story here made by the same folks involved. As it is, this is worth watching in order to see some terrific performances, especially Emma Thompson and Bill Nighy, as well as the sublime Keira Knightley."	4.0	Unabashed romantic comedy	2006-09-11	1	0	1

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A15NLCXF69HL4M	Scott A. Humphries	"This film is an overly-sentimental, messy, cynical exploitation of the popular ""contemporary British(esque) love story"" complete with easy listening high tempo FM style soundtrack (I suspect the songs were selected first and the script written around them), attractive high profile cast and lots of romantic swelling-music types of scenes.In fact, that is the problem.  Rather than telling us one love story the film gets greedy and tries to tell a dozen, essentially eliminating the build up in each individual story and simply racing towards its climactic clincher(s).  We never get to know any of the characters very well (exceptions Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, and even then it is because of what the actors bring to their parts rather than what is written), we never get to care about any of the stories.Another problem is the men.  They are uniformly soppy.  Hugh Grant has only ever played one good part - About a Boy - and in this film he plays the usual soppy, weak Hugh Grant style of man.  Only now we are expected to believe him as the UK Prime Minister!  Colin Firth also displays his willingness to be typecast as the next Hugh Grant, but the real shocker is sexy Andrew Lincoln also being reduced to a soppy mess.  Is this really the sort of man that women swoon over?The story.  Well, there are just too many of them.  This film is not Nashville or Grand Hotel but it thinks it is.  Far too many characters vaguely and uninterestingly linked together makes a mess. Sometimes more star power is just more stars.The cast are, sadly, excellent (sadly because they are mostly wasted).  Why Laura Linney got involved in this is anyone's guess.  Bill Nighy is funny but verges on absurd.  Only Emma Thompson has a chance to actually act, and to be fair it is a killer scene - the Joni Mitchell scene - proving what a very clever actor can do with very little material.  Subtle, moving, beautiful.One scene does not make a film.  The songs are good, the actors good (and pretty - boys and girls), but the film is overall a  disappointment.Did anyone actually think that scene of the boy running through the airport was good, really?Still, if you enjoyed Under the Tuscan Sun or Notting Hill (ie if you do not demand much from your films) you'll probably like this."	2.0	A mess	2006-06-02	12	5	7
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AG5WYO2FG2KKX	Scott Goodwin	My wife and I saw this at a preview last night and both loved it.  Since there are a lot of different stories going in, with characters crossing paths and interconnected in different ways, it took a few minutes to sort them all out.Once we did, though, it was worth it.  Most of the stories deal with some sort of romantic love (first love, lost love, unrequited love, etc.), but a few dealt with familial love or long-term friendship-type love.  Because of this, it sometimes felt uneven (Porky's crossed with You Can Count On Me), but on the whole was one of the funnier movies I've seen this year.There were many moments that stuck with me on the ride home--I keep wanting to share them in this review, but they would spoil the surprises.  Also, loads of great performances from people I've never seen before--the kid who plays Liam Neeson's son Sam; the woman who plays Colin Firth's housekeeper Aurelia; the woman who plays Natalie, the Prime Minister's assistant; all were standouts in a very funny movie.	5.0	Good Stuff; Very Funny	2003-11-02	4	3	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2I7ZAB04Q0DML	Scott Kolecki	"When my wife said she really wanted to see ""Love Actually"", I was indifferent, not overly anxious to go sit in a theater and watch another ""chick-flick"", but equally uninterested in spending a night home alone-and so we went.I have to confess, it was a great film.The premise is a bunch of individual relationships reflecting the many facets of love.  At one end of the spectrum, there is the dignified, new elected Prime Minister of England, (Hugh Grant), who is at once smitten with one of the many assistants working in his office.  At the other end there is a brash, aging rock star, whose self indulgent lifestyle and brazen behavior has made him a loner, never having found true love.  In between are seven other relationships-newlyweds, an old married couple struggling with fidelity, a husband whose wife has recently died leaving him with a step-son he hardly knows, a man who struggles with bachelorhood after he catches his wife sleeping with his brother, a young couple who meet on the set of a movie they are both ""starring"" in, a woman who struggles with approaching a man she has secretly loved for years, and a young man who sets out for the United States in search of the other great American dream-dating a supermodel.The movie is fun and funny, at once touching and satirical, painting a vivid portrait of the many struggles every individual and couple faces throughout the course of their particular lives and in the life they share with one another.  The film has a very warm feel to it, and really touches on the many issues that love carries with it.  It is great for men and women alike.  For the men, the story touches on the many challenges we all experience in trying to live up to the expectations, demands and needs of the women we love.  For women, it has the warmth of romance, combined with the reality of the imperfections men never see in themsleves.  Surely, this film is a reminder that all relationships, even the great ones, have flaws, speed-bumps and little curves that nobody can expect or see until they encounter them.  Whats more, this film is genuinely funny, and will leave the audience laughing as they exit the theater.Rated R for sexuality, nudity and language, the movie should be reserved for older viewers.  The R rating is there with good reason and should not be ignored.  This is not a film for children, and it is doubtful that children would enjoy this as much as the more ""mature"" audience for which the film is intended.So men, fear not, this movie isn't just for women, you will enjoy it as much, if not more, than they do.  Go see it, I promise you won't be disappointed.Scott Kolecki"	5.0	"I Actually Loved ""Love Actually"" -- And I'm A Guy!!"	2003-11-17	6	4	2
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"Richard Curtis (""4 Weddings and a Funeral,"" ""Bridget Jones' Diary,"" ""Notting Hill"") may be the reigning champ of the British romantic comedy.  In ""Love Actually,"" he lets his writing and directing talents run wild as he gives us seemingly dozens of interlapping tales of romance -- mainly comic, some farcical, others poignant -- all based in London in the five weeks before Christmas.Where does one start with a movie that stars (and gives quality time to) such luminaries as Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Laura Linney, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman, and has inspired cameos by Billy Bob Thornton as the U.S. President, and numerous American beauties such as Shannen Elizabeth and Denise Ricahrds?  I'd probably start with the guy who nearly steals the show, Bill Nighy.  In the movie's most original subplot, Nighy plays Billy Mack, an aging pop star reduced to rewriting one of his hits (""Love is All Around,"" from the ""4 Weddings"" soundtrack, naturally) in a shameless bit of exploitation as ""Christmas is All Around.""  Mack knows he's doing this just for a buck, and he tells everyone (including the listening public, to the horror of his long-suffering manager) what horrible dreck the song is.  But it's his chance to become popular again, and that's what a pop star needs.  Nighy personifies the aging rocker to the hilt in a movie-defining performance.The Billy Mack sub-plot kind of stands to one side in this movie, as its only connection to the rest of the stories comes through the other characters listening to Mack's ""hit"" on the radio or watching the video, a horribly sexist monstrosity directly descended from Robert Plant's ""Addicted to Love"" video.The rest of the cast is more or less inter-related, whether by employment, marriage, or birth.  Take your pick for charming subplots.  Colin Firth discovers his wife's affair with his own brother, and he falls for his Portuguese housekeeper -- leading to a romance that overcomes a hilarious language barrier.  Liam Neeson's wife has just died, and his adorable 11-year old stepson is tormented both by the loss of his mother and the fact that he is in love with the most popular girl in school.  The solution - become a talented musician, and the girls will fall for you (just like Billy Mack!).  Or there's Hugh Grant as the bachelor Prime Minister, who becomes a national hero after publicly chastising the U.S. President (Thornton, so very creepy) for lording its superpower status over its friends.  Sure, he's a national hero, but he's also got a crush on his catering manager, and he's not sure if he can ask her for a date.And so on, and so forth.  One could go on describing sub-plots (and there are many other worthy stories here), but it would take longer than it does to watch the movie.Curtis' greatest achievement is the magnificent interweaving of these various tales.  Each has a slightly different emotional heft to it -- there's the melancholy tale of Alan Rickman's tepid experimentation with an affair at the expense of his wife, Emma Thompson, but there's also the absurdist adventure of Connor, self-proclaimed ""sex god on the wrong continent,"" who goes to America to meet girls, and in Milwaukie, Wisconsin, he hits the mother lode.  But the stories flow together naturally, and that's no small trick.This is an ultimately silly-yet-heartfelt movie that contains a several laughs and outright guffaws, and you will also probably find yourself tearing up during a few scenes, as well.  But be warned -- this is definitely an R-rated movie, both on the language front as well as with the ""skin.""  Some movies are rated 'R', and you're not really sure why - but this one's clear.  I'm not criticizing, but you may want to think twice before watching this movie with prudish friends and family.Check it out."	4.0	Over-the-top romance interweaves innumerable entertaining short stories	2006-01-03	6	4	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3OSG1RT98QQZI	"S. Dill ""homeschoolmamaof4"""	I had heard so much that was good about this movie, that we went ahead and purchased it to watch together on Valentine's day.  What a shocker! First, there are just too many storylines to keep up with, and then there is the sex... if your idea of a romantic comedy includes sex and sexual innuendo, then this is for you.  I found the scenes with the porn stars to be offensive and unnecessary. The references to sex, and even with a young boy being sexually obsessed with a girl, was just too much for me.And then there is the language.  Again, if you can get around the F-bomb being dropped every five minutes, then you'll love this movie.  I understand that maybe the British have different standards for use of language then some of us, but this made it just horrible to listen to, much less watch.I would say we made it about less than an hour into the movie before we turned it off.I think this could have been done in a way that was much more tasteful.	1.0	Too much distraction	2008-02-26	17	7	10

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AISZLQUY7LZ49	SeattleSue	I watch this movie every Christmas - and still laugh and cry out loud each time.  This is a film about love (actually) in it's varied and infinite forms, reminding us how easily it can be lost, or found, depending on what we are willing to put into it--what fears will we face, what mountains will we climb, what doors will we open in the name of this great human motivator.  That rather heavy moral to the story is told in a number of light, funny, romantic and charming vignettes represented by different characters connected in some way,over one Christmas season. The music score helps set the mood, as does the wonderful cast of British staples:  Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Simon Pegg, Andrew Lincoln, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Kiera Knightly, and the incomparable Bill Nighy.  Treat yourself to two hours of laughter, tears, and love this holiday season!	5.0	Favorite Annual Holiday Film	2013-12-23	0	0	0
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2RDR5G65D9H84	Sebastian Fernandez	"The movie shows a collection of stories that at first seem independent of each other, but we start seeing interrelationships as the action advances. The narrator is trying to demonstrate that love is everywhere and that is why he is ""telling"" us all these different anecdotes.I have always favored British humor, and in this case I was not let down, since some of the situations are absolutely hilarious. There are almost no words to describe the unbelievable cast, which includes actors like Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson and Colin Firth, among many others.David (Hugh Grant) is the new British Prime Minister and upon his arrival at his new ""home"" is captivated by Natalie, his new personal assistant. Bill is a singer at the end of his career trying to make a come back with a Christmas hit by adapting the lyrics of an old hit to make it a Christmas song. Peter and Juliet got married recently, and Peter's best friend, Mark, is having trouble dealing with this new event because he holds a secret that can destroy everything. Colin, a young impetuous guy, is looking for love and decides that his best option is to go to America, where the girls are ""easier"".Daniel (Neeson) has recently lost his wife and is trying to surge into clarity again while taking care of Samuel, his beloved stepson. At the same time, Samuel has a crush on a girl at school and is very serious about it, seeking Daniel's help for his quest. Sarah is in love with one of her co-workers, but has a burden that makes her life very complicated. Finally, Jamie is an author, who found his wife cheating on him with his brother, and looked for refuge in France. Here he meets Aurelia, a Portuguese girl that works as his maid.This is the best romantic comedy I have seen in the last few years. The dialogues are funny and witty, the cast is first class and there is not one dull moment in the whole film. As a final note, just watching the scene in which Hugh Grant dances, makes this movie worth seeing!"	5.0	The perfect romantic comedy	2004-05-22	0	0	0

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2EFCVL5H31A96	Serket	This is an okay movie.  The prime minister has a relationship with the girl who brings the tea and she is 15 years younger than him (reminiscient of President Clinton who was 26 years older than Monica Lewinsky).  There are some good moments and a few funny ones. I get the impression that public performances of the nativity are more acceptable in England as compared to here. The film features a lot of famous British actors: Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Rowan Atkinson, Alan Rickman, and Kris Marshall.	3.0	Different shades of love	2011-03-19	3	1	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3DHWG8JJY6NZL	S. Fenton	I think so. And this one fits the bill. Several stories twine and intertwine throughout, and even those that border on the expected are played with such charm and grace -- as well as a few little twists that embellish the story -- that they are easily forgiven. Surprise cameos are a delight.Among the extras on the DVD are a few deleted scenes, with commentary by director Richard Curtis. As a sidebar, he notes that the film originally ran closer to 3 hours, 45 minutes, but he had to cut 80 minutes or so to get the film into commercial length for theatres. Usually deleted scenes are best left that way, for any one of a number of reasons. However, almost without exception, the deleted scenes here would have, I think, added greatly to the fun of the movie. And in the end, that's what this movie is -- fun -- and a surprising pleasure. (Would love to see a cut that ran the full 3 hrs 45!)Definitely not just a chick flick. Recommended without hesitation for all adults!	5.0	Is there room for a simply sweet movie?	2004-05-10	4	2	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1IMNNBC4ME0NB	ShamayimBlue	Emma Thompson and Bill Nighy steal the show in Love Actually and rise above the rest of the cast.  Thompson is wonderful as the stay-at-home mom who has to confront the fact that her husband is romantically interested in a young officemate; her performance is a combination of sweet, wry humor and deep hurt.  Then there's Nighy, as a crude and raunchy ex-rocker who, in one of the movie's best scenes, shows that he has a heart...  and a love for the most unexpected person!The rest of the film wasn't as great as I expected it to be.  The jokes were not all funny, and the numerous storylines made the movie sort of shallow; it had a glossy, frosty, holiday feel to it.	3.0	Watch it for Thompson and Nighy	2004-07-21	4	3	1

I took my 12 year old daughter and even though there were several nude scenes, I was never embarassed to have her setting next to me. This movie was not your typical hollywood boy meets girl flick. This film showed you several sides of LOVE. The love between a parent and child, love between siblings, old love, new love, love from afar, and love without words, for love is truly the international language. I laughed , I cried, but most of all I LOVED while I watched, and as the movie ended I saw I was not alone. People were smiling, holding hands, and in an all around better mood for having been there.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1L8HRCM60W0W7	Shashank Tripathi	"There is very little really not to like about this charming collage of a movie.Brilliant ensemble of actors, and thus by implication great cameos from the ilk of Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and Emma Thomson; credible romantic vignettes intercut together, and thankfully not too saccharine to be implausible (not everyone ends up in their preferred romance for instance); a fair bit of nudity (a big bold ""R Actually""); and above all, some delectable humor -- there are sentimentalistic crests but swiftly followed by a jibe or crack that balances the narrative.The vignettes:-- Hugh Grant as a wonderfully self-deprecating bachelor prime minister in love with a benign Brit version of M. Lewinsky-- Liam Neeson as a widower managing his grief by lending his teenager son a hand with his love life-- Colin Firth as a writer with a soft spot for his Portuguese maid while working on a novel in a French town-- Billy Bob Thornton as a nasty U.S. president who gets his comeuppance-- Emma Thomson as the cheery wife of Alan Rickman, an executive who is falling prey to the come-ons of an office colleague-- Bill Nighy as a spent-out rock star on the comeback trail with a holiday version of the Trogg's ""Love Is All Around""-- Laura Linney as an American expat with a romantic life stymied by her obligation to her autistic brother-- Andrew Lincoln as a tortured bloke secretly in love with the trophy wife (Keira Knightley) of his best friend-- Kris Marshall as a wanna-be superstud trying to get to US, ""cocksure"" his British accent will be a chick magnet-- Martin Freeman and Joanna Page as two innocents who fall in love while working as stand-ins in a porn movie-- Rowan Atkinson as a prissy department store clerkWhat more can you ask for in one sitting? Don't read too much into the ""too long to be interesting"" reviews, this is a must-watch for anyone with a sensitive bone and an adult pass.

I hate saying outloud to the characters in a movie ""why don't you just say/do {insert logical suggestion here}"".  What I love about this movie is that it is sweet and sappy but not in a manner that makes me want to shove my finger down my throat afterward.  The film takes a look at several different angles we see every day in relationships and not all of them are happy nor are all of them ever resolved.  The humanity included, however, is what appeals to me most.Unlike critics who see this film as a dramatization of commercial Christmas at its worst combined with weak writing, I see several fun, imaginative, (even if not believable) and witty dramas tied up in a nifty little package.  I love the dry humor and the music is thoughtful and appropriate."	5.0	Even my manly husband liked it.	2008-04-29	5	2	3
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A13STKDYQO5DQ8	"S. Hebbron ""S B H."""	"I am usually a fan of the work of Mr Curtis but this film feels like an explotation of a rather tired working theme.It has elements of all the other films and trys to encapsulate ""Modern Britain"" rather cheesily, with Hugh Grant as a Tony Blair style PM. Unfortunately he comes across as more the average bumbling, Biology Teacher and his developing romance with his Cockney Char Lady is just a touch too ""Eliza Dolittle"", the Char Lady is played just a little too corsely aswell; the ""F"" word is not a comedic tool.There are some strong perfomances here though, Emma Thompson is truly cracking. The scene when she secretly uncovers her husbands betrayal of her is poignant, painful and exquisitely pitched. Andrew Lincoln, (Fans will remember him as ""Egg"" in the brilliant ""This Life"" on BBC TV) pining away for the love of his best friends wife is astonishingly engaging in his portrayal of the pain of the unrequited love, it's a shame Kira Knightely lets him down by being so utterly wet and ineffective, no real disply of anything other than cliched, embarassed, twittering, midle class women.Liam Neesom is of course brilliant and Colin Firth is a classic as the tortured grieving man. There is a lot to like about this film but it just trys too hard to captilise on Curtis's past success and the strengths of it's good actors; it gives the poorer performers more to do than they can handle or convey too.As a result there is too much going on and the film doesn't really seem to know if it want's to explore a little more serious drama or build up the comedy segments (incidently I think it's time British films stopped assuming that adding a few quiant British expletives is all that is needed to raise the roof in America - it's old news to our America cousins!).This is a pleasent enough and hopeful film but it's a bit of a mess and ever such a tad cliched.The romantic view of rainy, cosy, London is very grating in it's ""Mary Poppins"" approach too."	3.0	Just a little too silly really.	2005-02-06	30	22	8

If the film had focused only on their three stories and as a result allowed them to develop more fully, it would have been a great film. I saw absolutely no point in the story line of the aging pop star, the idiot Colin who goes to America looking for sex (and, amazingly, FINDS it! If he had found a sweet Wisconsin girl who fell in love with him, that would have been OK, but as it was, it was beyond disgusting), or the couple who meet apparently while working as stand-ins for porn stars. Way too many characters. Keira Knightly, Laura Linney, and Hugh Grant have mildly interesting story lines, but only because you like the actors. And frankly, I don't even understand why the filmmakers bothered paying Rowan Atkinson for the annoying little bit part he had.As for the ""America bashing,"" we do that plenty here in the U.S., thank you, so why should we complain that the Brits do it? A bit hypocritical if you ask me. Let them bash away--it's their prerogative, and it has nothing to do with the quality (or lack thereof in this case) of this movie.There were so many story lines that I may have actually missed a couple of them here--it was too much to take on in one film, and it wasn't a success. Still, it's worth the rental for the performances of Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, and Colin Firth--and especially the little boy who played Liam Neeson's stepson."	3.0	a huge disappointment	2004-05-31	4	2	2

Parts of it were wholly depressing. I mean, the guy bought the necklace! But it wasn't for his wife! (sob) And she found out! But she couldn't let the kids know! (sniffle, snort) But parts of it were really... well... romantic, I guess, if implausible. My favorite was the guy and the girl who spoke different languages, but fell in love anyway.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3O69XC0YYI7YF	S. Pflueger	I went to see Love Actually three times in the theaters.  It was heart-warming and wonderful, sad and depressing, silly and did I say wonderful.  It never failed to perk up my depressed heart and reduce me to tears at the same time.  The episodic flair of the plot weaves many famous English actors in varying degrees of love.  Love that is failing, love enduring, and of course love just starting.  I did think that the young guy looking for (...) felt out of sync with the rest of the movie.  The love between two friends was a nice twist for the ending.  My favorite part was Emma Thomson's realization scene.  I cried almost every time I saw it.  Emma Thompson is heartbreaking in her crying scene that threatens to steal the movie in a movie of many great scene stealers.  In other words, her scene is awesome.It is hard for anyone to stand out in this ensemble cast because everyone stands out.On the whole this movie is made of 12 20 minute dramedies that intersect.

I checked it out and it seemed just...well, you know...like the average romantic comedy chick flick hooey-looey horse crap that Hollywood has piled on us for the last eighteen millenniums. Shrugging it off, I didn't pay much attention. Well, this New Year's Eve 2006 on the eve of 2007, we had lots of people over and we all sat down and watched it. Now before I continue, anybody who knows me well enough knows that I am an absolute complete SUCKER for romantic comedies. It's just that, well, I haven't found a good one in a long time! Well, let's just leave it at the fact that I found it, and I hit the jackpot to be honest. Mix the movie ""Crash"" with ""The Breakup"" with ""Napoleon Dynamite"" with ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" with ""The Terminal"" with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" with ""The Family Stone"" and you get LOVE ACTUALLY, the ultimate romantic comedy as the DVD cover boasts. A multi-plot storyline simply about a group of unique individuals trying to find love in foggy Londontown at Christmas time, Love Actually features a stellar all-star cast that includes many, many well-known actors and actresses. In the movie, you get to experience all kinds of love from a different point of view: love between two hardcore porn stars, a young boy hitting on the most popular girl in school, the British Prime Minister and his secretary, an English author and his Portuguese maid, and a million and one other unlikely combos. The result is clear: a funny, feel-good, heartwarming, and above all romantic movie that all can enjoy...not just the romantic comedy suckers like me."	5.0	A romantic comedy that's ACTUALLY funny!	2007-03-22	6	2	4

It is a fantastic and very funny coupling of 9 storys.Hugh Grant made an excellent job as PM. In his older films I did not like him that much, but this time he completly convinced me (and that ""relationship"" with the American President was droll - nobody can ignore, that there`s a little bit of thruth in the real relationship between the actual PM and the actual President...)Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson (and his boy) did a great job as usually. The story of Colin Firth (a good actor too!) was as delighting as all the other small plots. The ""star"" Billy Mack is the ultimate comedian touch in the movie - very much better than Rowan Atkinson!And last but not least Keira Knightley: she is so wonderful and beautiful in that movie (She was gorgeous in POTC, but in LA she`s even better). And I liked her storyline very much with this ""triangular relationship"".And for some maybe angry Americans: The USA weren`t dissed that much. It was only a small joke that Billy Bob Thornton-thing (but only a guy like him, who does not like George W., could have played THIS president). The USA still are a great country - this movie didn`t change this and the country`s credit...And do not forget: For other nations it is quite normal to be the ""bad guys"" in lots of movies: the arabians, the germans, the japanese..."	5.0	Lovely Love Actually	2005-01-04	6	4	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AAS25PZSI4N29	Stephen M. Glaister	"This film is awful.  It's every wretched tic that writer/director Richard Curtis has picked up over the years rolled humorlessly and artlessly into one package.  The film looks and feels like a department store advertisement.  And note how almost every character has the same voice, and that that voice is in fact that of Hugh Grant's character Charlie from _4 weddings_ (Compare Curtis here with David Kelley who wrote every character on _Ally McBeal_ with the same Ally-voice).  Horrible.  Seriously, often film-makers with considerable gifts eventually make the franken-film in which they confirm every critical doubt about their talent- this is Curtis's, ""Shadows and Fog"" is Woody Allen's, ""Storytelling"" is Solondz's, and so on.  Romantic Comedy is a genre that is dear to many of us, for excellent reasons.  LA, however, marks the arrival of self-important bombast to the genre - it's the _Pearl Harbor_ or _Armageddon_ (""the ultimate"") of rom coms - and is cause for despair (both about the people who made it and the people who profess to like it).So... here's a movie that a lot of people are going to watch as a ""date"" movie.  One of you is almost certainly going to react allergically to the thing, whereas the other might be able to stand it (don't ask me how), and they're going to be ticked off at the allergically reacting one's carping (e.g., anyone with experience of Curtis's earlier works will find themselves involuntarily slipping into _Black Adder_ hyperbole: ""I would rather eat a pile of pig manure with a caviar spoon than watch another second....."").  Oh yes, love will be all around that night.  Do yourself a favor and watch instead any of the many Jane Austen flicks out there if you need a ""giddy round of couples"" fix."	1.0	If nightmarish levels of smug cutesiness are your thing....	2005-04-02	29	10	19
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2RHQMV5GD18Z8	Steven Aldersley	Love Actually (2003)Comedy, Drama, Romance, 135 minutesDirected by Richard CurtisStarring Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Liam NeesonHere's a movie that works for Valentines Day, Christmas, or date night. But unlike most of the offerings for those occasions, Love Actually is both smart and funny. The reason it works so well is the writing and the acting. Richard Curtis is genuinely witty and knows what these actors are capable of. Although the movie is long at 135 minutes, I usually find myself wishing it lasted a little bit longer.Most romantic comedies tell the story of one couple or two at the outside. Love Actually contains too many relationships to count and it doesn't restrict itself to romantic love. You'll also find the love between friends and family members. Some new relationships are formed, while others weaken.There are so many good actors involved. Hugh Grant plays the Prime Minister and he's not in a relationship, but soon finds that he likes a member of his staff. Colin Firth plays a writer who sees his marriage threatened when his wife has an affair, but unexpectedly finds new love. Laura Linney's character has been in love with a work colleague for years, but has never acted on it. Her reasons eventually become clear and illustrate another kind of love.My favorite relationship is the one between Daniel (Neeson) and his stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster). Daniel's wife has recently died, leaving him to raise Sam. He worries that Sam spends too much time in his room, but eventually learns what the problem is. The relationship between the two is so warm and honest that it's almost impossible not to root for Sam as he attempts to resolve his problem. It leads to some of the funniest scenes in the movie.You'll also find plenty of other good performances from the likes of Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman and Martine McCutcheon.Not everything turns out perfectly for the couples involved. Some face threats to their happiness and not all of them can be completely resolved to their satisfaction. Love Actually examines love and the many forms it can come in. Some of the situations reach the expected conclusion and many are uplifting. A few are even surprising. I've just never seen a movie attempt to keep so many romantic threads alive throughout the running time. Against all odds, it somehow keeps us invested in the outcome of all the story threads by continually updating the progress of each.According to my friends, I watch so many sad or depressing movies, but here's one that will lift your spirits. The opening scenes show how people allow their real emotions to show when they meet their loved ones at airports. That's essentially what Love Actually is about. To enjoy it fully, you'll need to allow your own emotions to show.	4.0	Great for date night, Christmas, Valentines or whenever you want to laugh	2012-02-29	2	1	1

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	ASF2Z8OJR0TP3	S. T. Peterson	Movie is set in UK and show Brits pursuing &#34;love&#34; during Christmas time, as it is suggested that Christmas time is when you are supposed to announce your love for someone else.This  movie is the epitome of cultural rot. It shows the confusion of modern western civilization. You have two people casually (and normally) talking to each other as they appear in simulated sex scenes for some sort of a &#34;movie&#34;. They eventually go out on a date and become a couple That is the &#34;love&#34; shown in this movie. These two seem to be inhuman in that they can &#34;separate&#34; their &#34;careers&#34; from their &#34;who they are as people&#34;. They appear to be &#34;normal&#34;. No one can be a semi-porn actor and then a normal next door neighbor. No one. The girl is even naked with her breasts hanging out. Sickness.Another &#34;love story&#34; is when an American at the office falls in love with what appears to be a Brazilian man at the office. We are told that they have &#34;loved&#34; each other from afar for 3 years. Well one night at a &#34;Christmas party&#34; (where pornographic photos called &#34;art&#34; are displayed--women's breats covered with santa clause hats and men's naked behinds are shown) they dance. Then of course their &#34;love&#34; leads him back to her place to strip off naked and go at it like dogs in a field. And if that is not enough he simply doesn't understand why she has to take multiple phone calls from her mentally committed brother, interrupting their fornicating (&#34;shagging&#34;). It doesn't last. More sickness.Then another &#34;love&#34; story involves a man who wants to go to America so he can &#34;shag&#34; as American girls are supposedly non-discriminating in who they sleep with. He goes and in a farcical kinda way 3 prostitutes, Robert Palmer backup singer girls show up and immediately invite him back to t heir one bedroom apt with the &#34;tiny bed&#34;.Then there is the multiculturalism bit . . . where we all love one another in this big happy non-discriminating world we live in. The red headed little body chasing a black American girl. The white English man chasing the Portugese barmaid. but then again I was told by Muslims that I worked with once that London was &#34;all non-white&#34; in their discussion of how &#34;whites were mean spirited&#34;.And I could go on and on with the other stories but you should have the idea now.The confusing part is that all of the above the profanity-laden dialogue to get a giggle out of that person or this one is mixed with lines that go something like &#34;I don't recall hearing that one of the calls from a person trapped in one of the Twin Towers went out to an enemy or to express revenge . . . that they were all made to tell people they loved how much they loved them.&#34; Just reminds you of the pagan/Christian mix of the Roman Empire before it collapsed. Just a big messy stinky stew of contradictions and confusion.Anyway this movie has nothing to do with love or Christmas. I will say that at least Christ was mentioned at least twice that I counted. That is what . . . Western Civ hanging on by at least a toenail?	2.0	more western civilization cultural rot	2013-12-25	5	0	5

It made me cry, laugh out loud and I left the Theatre with a smile all over my face. The film has 8 intertwined stories, which all come to this fantastic ending, that makes you feel good about the world. There is a fare amount of nudity, all of which is of a sexual nature, Although this is very funny I just thought it a little out of place compared with the rest of the film. The shame is because of this, it will be a good few years before my daughter can see the film she appeared in (she's only 7). Not every one of the stories has an unrealistic happy ending, this makes it more believable and leaves you wondering what happens to the characters next.I do recommend people who believe Christmas to be special to see this film.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3PJ4JVKU4WUVE	Sunshine T	"Love Actually IS actually a fairly good movie. But I must debunk the ever emerging theme of movies set primarily in Europa these days....that the USA is an ogre that is about to devour the world and that the 'tiny' nation-states are for want of a better description, better than us. We see several intersecting vignettes that pique the curiosity about the microscopic characters after a mini lecture that September 11th folks trapped in the WTC all managed to send messages of Love and not Hate or Revenge while they were still able.Each set of characters reflects that sentiment in growing ways that all impact each other, and finally--- we know that 'little Britain' is still the nation with a heart and bent for romantic and philanthropic love. The USA is counter-played as a somewhat distant second cousin--- where people come and go to Britain, get healed, get laid, get rich, and tower over the British people but are really no match.What I must strongly comment about are the depictions of The American President (who I am sure must be a Bush-like figure) and the Texas sluts who are so stupid that they fall for an ugly uncouth delivery boy just because he is 'British.'  Tell me, folks, just where did Britain become SOOOOO racially and politically correct? It seems to me that the BIG Nations of England, Spain, France, and the Dutch did their best to keep the slave trade and its various forms of bigotry going for as long as possible. In fact, one might want to check when the various European countries outlawed slavery vs when the USA did. Spare us the lectures, folks. Just entertain.The pairing of such heavyweights as Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman is genius. Rickman, my favorite villain of all time, is almost likable in this movie. But Emma, in her infinite indirectness, is not a shrinking violet or a victim. Both allow raw emotion to float to the top. And we watch like voyeurs. I honestly cringed when Rickman and Thompson go to bed together.And the sub-text for the scenes in Portugal were honest and very funny, albeit slanted against the weight-challenged.But what did grab my attention the most, being an ex-flower child, was the interplay between Billy Mack and his manager. Both knew exactly what they wanted and got there. And both, although embarrassingly honest and direct fumbled through their 'love' for each other, as only those born prior to 1960 honestly do. The tongue in cheek slap at the song ""Love is All Around,"" and the success that song has had through the years was the center and the crux of the movie. It really is, folks. Love IS all around. Even here in the good old USA, especially at Christmas.Highly recommended for Christmas viewing (although there is simulated sex and nudity). It is not a rehash of 'It's a Wonderful LIfe,' 'A Christmas Story,' or a 'Christmas Carol.' But it is all about Christmas and the spirit that makes us all tick."	4.0	Big Nation, Little Nation Rubbish	2010-01-02	3	0	3

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2ML1UOEZRGK2Y	Susan Bock	Hmmm. I am feeling like a voice in the wilderness. I like many things about this movie which shows different incarnations of love. What upset me is the portrayal of the schizophrenic brother of Laura Linney's character. In my opinion, he is an extreme case and the portrayal is scary. It perpetuates the stigma to the public and sends a message (so strong in visual media) of hopelessness to individuals suffering from mental illness and to their families as well, who already bear such a heavy burden. The writer could have portrayed this character as being out of the hospital, on the way to recovery, etc. It was just so disappointing, especially as so much of the film is well written.	2.0	Mixed Emotions	2009-10-29	5	1	4

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1JC0COP9J5KSA	Susan	This is a movie that I loved for many reasons.  It's sad, funny, and heartwarming, and has a great soundtrack.  Because it has all these qualities, I find it frustrating that the Director/Writer made some poor choices that I think hurt the movie.On the positive side, there is a wide range of love stories, great acting, and a fun Christmas theme.  My personal favorite is the aging rock star storyline, mostly because Bill Nihy is hilarious.  I also like the way there's inter-racial relationships in the movie, and that they're treated as nothing out of the ordinary.(Warning - the rest of my review contains some plot details)But some of the stories could have been so much better, which to me is a shame when this movie had the potential to be one of the best.  In the story with Colin Firth falling for his housekeeper, there was definitely chemistry there, but for him to sweep her off her feet and ask her to marry him so quickly (especially when they didn't speak the same language) was silly.  Another mistake (though not as significant) was having the housekeeper's father keep putting down her over weight sister, which was meant to add humor to one of the scenes.  This was intended as comic relief, but to me it just came across as mean-spirited and not funny.I also thought the story with Liam Neeson and his son (who recently lost his mother in the story) could have been written better.  The movie shows very little mourning on the boy or dad's part, even though the mother just died recently.  It tries to make it seem charming and cute that the boy's real reason for feeling sad is because he's in love, instead of grieving from losing his mother.  The only time they seemed to express their loss was the day of the mom's funeral.  Even the Dad is checking out an attractive lady by the end of the movie, even though his wife just recently passed away.  If I could rewrite that story, I would have at least had the mom/wife pass away a year ago, instead of so recently.  This would have made their behavior more believable to me.The Hugh Grant story was charming and cute, although I don't think they allowed enough character development.  To me they didn't show enough of the woman's personality for me to feel like I knew her and wanted to see them end up together.  I think it would have helped if they had another scene or two showing her being loving/kind to others (or with some other admirable quality), instead of using her humorous swearing habit or naivity to make her stand out.  In general I guess I would have liked to see a little more substance behind their attraction for each other.There are a few other quirks I would have changed too, but overall I still like this movie and think there are some great parts (some sad, some uplifting).  I recommend seeing it, but without young kids because there's quite of bit of nudity in one recurring storyline, and several with adult themes.  I just wish a few of the plot flaws were corrected so I could love this movie and include it in my favorites.	4.0	good, but with some flaws that are hard to overlook	2005-11-29	6	3	3
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1OWO3E7CT6XXR	Susan Lippl	I'm a great fan of films which take one out of the day to day drearies and really do what films are meant to do in my opinion, ENTERTAIN. I'm certain that many film experts will totally overlook this point and criticize on content, plot, actors and several other aspects which make them sound like experts. Be that as it may. I rate this film 100% entertaining, full of the good old fashioned type of British humour with a great sound track. I'm English but have been living on the Continent for the last 30 years and it actually made me feel homesick. If you're looking for pure, lighthearted entertainment, it's exactly what the doctor ordered, and not just at Christmas either. Good the whole year round.	5.0	Just for fun	2005-12-17	0	0	0
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1VGBF6COR3SIA	Susan Sloate, Author, FORWARD TO CAMELOT and ...	"My brother sent me this, telling me I'd enjoy it. He was right. I adored it, and so did my husband. Is it a PERFECT romantic comedy? Well, no. Richard Curtis does a brilliant job with a plethora of stories, but frankly, I'd gladly give up a few to get more screen time for some of my favorites (few of which seem to have been mentioned in customer reviews):1) Keira Knightley as the girl who gets married, then finds out that her husband's best friend, who she believed didn't like her, was head over heels in love with her and trying to hide it. To me, this is the most poignant of all the stories, as she discovers this unrequited passion and he tries valiantly to deal with it, even coming to her house at Christmas with carolers on audio tape so he can let her know he loves her but will not interfere with her marriage. Too sweet for words.2) Laura Linney, the American girl who's loved a colleague at work for years. But her brother, who's mentally disturbed, never lets her alone for more than a few minutes, and she will not put him on hold, even for a man she's really in love with.3) Hugh Grant as the very decent P.M. who thinks he must be nuts to be so attracted to one of his household staff, who is equally smitten with him. How can you not be enchanted by his solitary dance to ""Jump For Your Love"" and later, to his offhand comment when he finally has to go door to door on her street looking for her? When a neighbor recognizes him and questions his being there, he says casually, ""It's a new service. We hope to get round to everyone by New Year's.""4) Colin, the over-the-top guy who dreams of being a great stud -- and finds out an English accent works wonders when he goes to Wisconsin and gets EXACTLY what he wants for Christmas?5) Colin Firth as the writer nursing a broken heart whose housekeeper turns out to be the perfect antidote.6) Liam Neeson and his stepson, who both are in need of love for Christmas. Neeson's gentle encouragement of the boy is priceless, and his run through Heathrow Airport to say goodbye to his great love is delightful.Is it perfect? No. With so many stories it's too easy to lose some in the cracks, or for not all to be so interesting. I must be one of the few who found the story of the porn actors worthwhile -- the idea of two people falling in love while simulating sex for a living -- yet courting each other gently and even formally -- I thought was rather moving.But it's tied up brilliantly, with each story feeding into others, a feat that is most difficult to pull off. And in the end, I'd rather give 5 stars for the movie's intentions than diss it. The truth is, it makes you feel good about decent people who deserve love -- and in the end, that's a pretty noble thing for a movie to pull off.In sum, LOVE, ACTUALLY leaves you something both sweet and bittersweet. Love at Christmastime has been done before and will be done again. Luckily, this time it was done really well.

This movie is JUST a movie.  It is a romantic comedy which means you can't take anything too seriously.  If you leave a movie feeling entertained or you think humorously about it again the next day then it was a success.  I definitely thought about Love Actually again and again.  So don't let the critics control you- make your own decision.  It WAS AND IS FUN!!!Now here's my original review- This was by far the best movie I have seen all year.  It was delightful the way they intertwined the several different love stories.  It made it very fun to see how they would all relate to eachother.  This was a fun movie that really was uplifting and encouraging.  It also reminds you how it felt when you first fell in love or maybe were waiting for someone to notice you!

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A5WLUF4G7W03U	"Swampsprite ""Swampy"""	"I generally turn my nose up at romantic comedy, especially romantic comedy set around Christmastime, which this movie is.This movie is set in England, focusing on roughly ten people that are on the fringes of one another's lives through relation, aquaintance, or work. Each person gets their own little love story, and each love story has its own quirks. Not each one is about romantic love, but most are.Most amusing was the aged rock star, Billy Mack (Bill Nighy), who pulls a comeback through a shoddy Christmas remake of one of his old songs. Nighy is hilarious, and he says all those things that we never say about those annoying Christmas songs we are fed each year on the radio ala Bruce Springsteen's ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"" or George Michael's ""Last Christmas"".Then we have John (Martin Freeman), and Just Judy (Joanna Page), whose love story unfolds on the set of a soft core porn movie as they get to know each other while simulating sex for an entire camera crew.Hugh Grant is the Prime Minister in love with one of his staff, Liam Neeson is widowed stepfather to a lovesick little boy, and Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman play a couple bored with one another while his secretary tempts him.There are more subplots. I have barely scratched the surface.Hugh Grant was great, and as funny as he's ever been in this movie. Thomas Sangster, who played the little boy, Sam, was a show stealer and his chemistry with Liam Neeson is perfect.  This kid could have had his own movie. Truly, the ensemble cast we have here all does a great job.However, this movie seems to me a collection of subplots. Any one of these mini-stories could have been fleshed out to make a movie on its own, and you almost wish it had been because some of the little subplots were far more interesting than others.What we get instead is an overload of love. Platonic love, romantic love, old love, new love, puppy love, Christmas love, forbidden love, love busting through the language barrier, and family love. So much love! Yay, but not yay, because while the movie is fun to watch, and the end comes together beautifully, it's still a movie with too much going on to have anything other than a main theme revolving around a lot of people. To me, this is lazy film making because the characters only have a chance for minimal development, as does each story.This isn't to say that I wouldn't watch it again, but for me, it hasn't quite lived up to the hype either."	4.0	Pretty Good Actually	2004-12-13	6	5	1

While some of the story lines are simple, others will stay with you even after the movie ends.  If for no other reason, watch this to see the scene of Emma Thompson in her bedroom.  It's absolutely devastating.  There is no other word.  I've never seen such better song placement in a movie than  Joni Mitchell's, ""Both Sides Now"" .

I'm an enormous fan of British rom-com, so not surprising. But what really gets me about ""Love, Actually"" is that it gets better each and every time I see it.It's become a Thanksiving Day tradition at our house and the varied romances, both new and fading, never fail to bring a tear (or many) to my eyes. I could probably do without the nudity and simulated sex from the shy, movie stand-ins (the only thing, other than language, that makes this film kid unfriendly), but even they have bothered me less with repeat viewings.Hugh Grant is, of course, endlessly charming, if completely unbelievable, as the British Prime Minister, Liam Neeson is devastatingly great as a man who has lost the love of his life (a role that proved all too prophetic) and Colin Firth as a bumbling, cuckhold-turned-author is the first time I've ever really ""got"" Firth's leading man appeal.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A38I00SO3D9ZSM	S. Zayas	Loaded with superstars, Love Actually is an enjoyable, funny romantic comedy.  It's definitely entertaining but lacks substance.  Yes there are serious bits intended to tug at the heart strings, but they're all but swallowed by the comedy.  At the risk of sounding anti-American -- I'm quite the opposite -- much of this film's charm is that it's very British.As other reviewers have said, there's quite a bit of Four Weddings and a Funeral in Love Actually.  It follows that same formula.  If you're looking for something fresh and original, this film's not it.Others might chide me for being prudish, but some of the nudity and adult language, especially the cursing by young Sam, was entirely unnecessary.  Some of it, though, was  funny.  No matter how you feel about that sort of stuff, the movie's probably not suitable for younger viewers.This is a movie that both men and women can enjoy, especially if you're looking for something light-hearted.	3.0	"Surprisingly funny but unoriginal ""rom-com"" [3.5]"	2007-04-11	7	6	1

But, that certainly isn't the case! There are so many stories within stories, and it's actually rather fun making the connections of how characters are related to one another. Also, this film does contain a great deal of British humor (can't imagine why since it's a BRITISH film)...

There is no time for character development in this mishmash of stories, so the director didn't bother with it and simply jumped to intimacy. I usually love divergent story-line plots, but this movie was a disappointment on all levels. It panders to those who would, with glazed and vapid eyes, fall into a relationship with someone they hardly know and then wonder why they walk away, soon after (very soon after) with bruised hearts and warped ideas about love.I am surprised by the positive reviews it received. I guess our culture is really more concerned with the appearance of love than the gritty, sacrificial, gradual and deep, ""actual"" thing.If I could give a negative rating to a film - for destroying or at least misrepresenting that which it claims to tout - I would do so here.

That said, ""Love Actually"" suffers from excess romantic contrivance and from having crucial character development hit the cutting room floor.Romantic sappiness is just plain funny and ridiculous to observe.  ""Love"" doesn't take maximum advantage of that angle as ""Four Weddings and A Funeral"" did, and this film suffers as result.  Still, there are genuinely funny moments, but their impact is blunted by the Gordian Knot of storylines.The women are limited to idealized stereotypes. This is clearly a film driven by the romantic urgency of the male characters.  Only Emma Thompson hints at characterization depth, but it appears that key elements of that story line got cut, so we don't see really her as anything but every-mom faced with aging and pilandering. The potential for Laura Linney's character is never realized.This film is worth investing a pleasant evening in, but ""Love Actually"" desperately needed a consult with the ""Sex and the City"" writers.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3UWRNANSWCXW6	Terry Nightingale	"""Love Actually"" was generally a funny and entertaining film, but I thought they went a bit overboard with a few things. I could have done without the porn-star couple, for example, or the cliche ""run through the airport before the plane departs"" scene when the young boy is trying to catch the American girl on whom he has a crush before she flies off to America, perhaps never to return.There also wasn't enough development of a relationship between the PM and his caterer. First she hires onto his staff and embarasses herself profusely, then there are a few not-particularly-romantic scenes of them going about their general business. When the PM finds her in an awkward situation with the President of the United States, he quietly has her transferred to another department, thinking that's the end of it.Upon the unexpected receipt of a Christmas card from her, the PM suddenly realizes he loves her, which makes no sense since as far as we the audience know, he doesn't really even know her that well. It wasn't very believable to me that a man in his position would go to so much trouble to pursue a woman unless he suspected that she was pretty special, and I didn't get the sense from the story that he could have known enough about her to justify the lengths he went to.All in all, ""Love Actually"" is a fun movie with a positive message about weathering the good and bad of romantic relationships (and platonic ones like the aging rock star and his manager), so long as you're willing to overlook a few unbelievable aspects of the storyline."	4.0	Fun and Entertaining, But Could Have Been Better	2004-07-30	1	1	0

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AP9RVNCXHB3OB	Thayer	I am a huge fan of the large ensemble-multi story-intercutting kind of movies, from the Altman films to Traffic and Happiness etc. This one is no exception. I love the whole look and feel of the film. It's very celebratory and joyous but also heartwarming and a little depressing.There are multiple storylines that are slightly related to each other that allows some different stories to somehow interconnect (sisters, friends of friends, workmates etc), but the central theme that holds all these stories together is that all of them are stories related to LOVE! Of course some stories are more interesting than others but overall I think there's no really bad storyline.The one that I really like is the Laura Linney's storyline. There's romance, drama, and comedy. It's heartbreaking when she finally danced with her long time crush office mate and finally realizing that he might actually like her too. But I am disappointed that towards the end the storyline was somehow neglected. We didn't see what happened to the two, there was no satisfying conclusion.Great performances from the entire cast that ranges from simply being funny (Bill Nighy), amusing (Hugh Grant), heartbreaking (Emma Thompson, Laura Linney) and just plain romantic (Colin Firth)The DVD contains a wealth of worthy supplements. I particularly enjoy the deleted scenes. The only reason they were cut was of time constraint but they could actually enhance the movie. The only thing I was disappointed is that I thought I was going to find deleted scenes with the underdeveloped Laura Linney's storyline, but sadly there wasn't any significant scene for that storyline, makes me wonder if that was how the director intended the storyline to end. There is also a great commentary by the director and some member of the casts. As well as an entertaining music commentary by the director to why he chose some of the songs used in the movie.Grade: A-	5.0	Love is all Around!	2005-08-02	4	2	2
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3KKPVZ2EQQLAB	The archduke	"Usually, the basis for the romantic comedy is quite simple. We follow one story line of star-crossed lovers through a couple of laughs, and a couple of ups and downs, before their inevitable getting together in the final scene of the film. ""Love Actually"" also does this, but on a much grander scale. This movie has every romantic-comedy plotline ever invented: the simpleton just looking for sex, the best friend in love with his best friend's new bride, the cute assistant in love with someone more powerful than her, the sultry secretary trying to sleep with her boss, the married boss trying to keep together a long marriage, the man whose wife slept with his brother and retreats to France for a new frame of mind, the man whose wife has just died, the boy with his first love, the porn stars, the aging rocker. Okay, so all of these stories sound a little bit daunting, but they are put together seamlessly in this phenomenal movie.Based around the month leading up to Christmas, the director takes us through these eight stories, who interconnect, of course. The one thing that is done better here than in many movies of this genre, is that we actually care about all of the stories. Enough is given here that we like all of the characters, whether they are ""good"" or ""bad"".One thing that is all-too frequently left out of the romantic comedy genre is the comedy aspect of it. ""Love Actually"" is full of British wit, and there are a few laugh out loud scenes here. For those who enjoy the dryness of British humour, this is for you. If you laughed at ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", you will laugh at this.What makes this such a good romantic comedy is that there are so many stories, and so much offered to the viewer that they cannot leave dissapointed. This is a movie that will make you smile, because it is so heartfelt, despite the obvious cheesiness and mellowdrama. This is one of those films that can briefly restore your faith in love and humanity, because everything in it is so wholesomely good and pure.If you are a fan of romantic comedy, this movie is the ultimate. It conquers all of its rivals over the past few years, and handily at that.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3E849GYQYOTAQ	The Preacher	"About once every 2 years I'll go see a movie that my girlfriend drags me to.  I've sat through eye bleeders like Legally Blonde, Runaway Bride, Serendipity and How The Grinch Stole Christmas.  I've even endured brain smashers like Maid In Manhattan, The Wedding Planner and Miss Congeniality!  So, needless to say when she told me she wanted to go see a movie called Love Actually I thought, ""Oh, I wonder what new ""hot"" and ""super-talented"" ""actress"" is going to be the star of this turd.""  I had it all wrong!  I left the theatre happy, feeling like I got my money's worth.  The story isn't your token man/woman falls in love with man/woman, something bad happens, they overcome it and everything turns out great in the end.  Although things turn out great in the end of this movie there are so many different stories happening that you won't get bored at all.  I loved the casting too, alot of the people in this film are in other films I love! Liam Neeson in Darkman, Martin Freeman in The Office, Bill Nighy in Shaun Of The Dead, Alan Rickman in Die Hard...well, I don't really love Die Hard but I do like Rickman alot...and even though I've never liked Hugh Grant he is good in this movie.So, after seeing this movie once in the theatre and about 8 times on DVD I can assure you that you'll like this movie.  It sure as heck beats Miss Congeniality!  It may even become one of those movies that you HAVE to watch when Christmas rolls around, I know it's become one of those Christmas classics for me."	4.0	Really a great movie.	2006-12-12	5	3	2
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3L909WM9LK7DZ	The Reluctant Psychoanalyst	"The reluctant analyst and the reluctant wife annually, more or less, engage in a holiday viewing tradition.  When we can find time away from the kids (this actually is a movie that, were it not for some necessary and in some ways silly nudity would be wonderful for our teens), we escape for a couple of hours into the romantic fantasy world, set during the Christmas season, of Love Actually.  This star studded British comedy (Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman, Laura Linney, and a bunch of really good character actors) seems like it should be an ensemble piece, but it is more a collage of individual love stories woven together by the affiliations that the players have with each other.  The stories range from the absurdly carnal - the British loser who goes to a random bar in Wisconsin and, because of his cute British accent, beds not one but four women - to the touchingly sweet - the naive couple that are playing stand-ins in an X-rated film, so get to know each other while wearing no clothes and yet manage to engage in an innocent love affair and the writer who falls in love with the woman who is cleaning his home and she with him even though neither can speak a word of the other's language.  In between are stories of love on the rocks and how couples survive, romantic love shelved by fraternal devotion, the love of the rock star for his fat manager  (and of the masses for an aging rocker who is cheeky), a story of first love guided by paternal love, the love of a hopelessly klutzy prime minister for one of his staff, and forbidden love left unconsummated because of respectful friendship.  Left on the cutting room floor, but available in the out takes, are more love stories - stories of maternal love and committed love in the face of death.  It is a banquet - a feast of love.  More love than one has the right to imagine - and it is sandwiched between the opening and closing sequences of anonymous lovers, parents and children, and friends greeting each other at Heathrow airport.  As Hugh Grant intones over the opening montage, ""Love actually is, all around.""See the full review at..[...]"	5.0	Love Actually is a depiction of True Love...	2013-12-23	0	0	0

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A268WAQS5WNMGJ	Thomas B. Gross	If you like Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill, this DVD is actually worthy buying, not just renting.  It is actually a better movie than I had expected based on the reviews, and the commentary by Richard Curtis and Hugh Grant (as well as Bill Nighy and the child actor Thomas Sangster) is excellent: perhaps actually more entertaining than the movie itself and extremely informative.  It's worth it just to hear Hugh Grant make snide remarks about Colin Firth (actually very amusing).  Also interesting to learn that one of the scenes in this movie had actually been originally written for Four Weddings and a Funeral.The deleted scenes on the DVD are also actually very interesting.  The movie was actually editted down from an original 3 1/2 hours.  If Curtis had been allowed to actually release all the junk he had filmed it might have actually ruined his career (the original climax with Thomas Sangster doing elaborate acrobatics at Heathrow is awful, actually).	5.0	Worth buying for Hugh Grant fans	2004-05-17	4	2	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A116DN182N56OD	Thomas Sain Moss	"Someone somewhere has used editing software to snip this movie apart, then stitched it back together putting each ""story"" by itself instead of having the viewer get each story in bits and pieces over the length of the movie.  There's this thing in moviedom when some producer gets EVERYBODY to be in their movie, and I guess with enough people in it, someone in the film will draw fans.  Multiply the stars by 10 and you get box office, regardless of the movie's quality.  The thing that kills me here is how much women seem to love this movie. I read somewhere that Taylor Swift's favorite movie is Love Actually. Favorite?  Out of all of the movies ever made, THIS is someone's favorite?The first thing that turned me off was how crude it was. The language is gratuitously bad- seriously, it reminded me of Robocop.  The Chubby Girl (Hugh Grant's Prime-Minister-dating-the-secretary bit) decides to throw around F bombs at work, in public, to herself, to the viewer, then near the end she's at home, and Mr PM shows up to Cinderella her off to wherever (not romantic in the least, by the way- it's like a school Christmas play with a ridiculously impossible closing number that just does more to make this movie as over-the-top fake as everything else in it) and Chubby, in front of four generations of her family, rather nonchalantly shouts ""WHERE'S MY F___ING SWEATER?"" and no one even turns a head. I can imagine- hell, forget that- go to next Christmas where you're in the family room with the grandparents, mom and dad, brothers and sisters and nieces and nephews and shout that out to the room.Story One: (not in order, because the way this film prevents anyone from having the slightest bit of empathy with any of the characters in it, who cares about the order) Slimy Dude Man From Die Hard and Harry Potter cheats on his wife, she knows, end of the movie: unresolved. Fabulous.  Story Two: Useless, empty, boring couple meet apparently at a porn set, and 95% of their scenes are shot with them butt naked simulating sexual acts while the director tried to liven things up by over-emphasizing the fact that they were actually on a set by having the crew do stupid things like hold a light meter up to them.  Over.  And over.  And over.  End of this story? I think it's possible they might have a date, Everything they say to each other is... stupid.  I try to think of better words than that at my age, but stupid is just so simple and accurate.  They aren't cute, they aren't funny, engaging, charming- nothing.  They are gross, boring, and rather ugly. I daresay they're the two nastiest people in the film, and we have to see 10+ scenes with them naked, talking about nothing. Story Three: Boring Guy's wife cheats on him with his own brother.  he knows, he moves into some villa in Italy to type on an antique typewriter and >>SURPRISE!&lt;&lt; love at first sight with a gross maid that some woman hires for him. She speaks Portuguese, he speaks English, neither the two shall meet, yet they end up being engaged after spending, oh I don't know- a month together, having said nothing to each other that the other can understand.Don't get me wrong, a good love-at-first sight story can be appreciated (even though it's BS anyway) but let's not make 6 of them in one film and have each of them ridiculously impossible. It cheapens an already cheap premise.Story Four: Boring Man No One Will Ever Care About In Any Film loses his wife (apparently) and he seems to all of a sudden become a dad to his bobbleheaded little bitty kid.  And thankfully uses the same foul language with him as Chunky uses in front of God and everybody. ""Hey buddy! Did you have a good day at school? Let's go get some f___ing ice cream, ya?""  Come on.  Let's go all-out and chase a sixth-grader that you think you're in love with (because you know- sixth graders are all into love at that age, plus they really understand it) and then later at the airport I'll create a distraction and you run past security and have a brigade of cops chasing you all the way to the gate, where, when they catch you, they simply escort you, hands-off, back to your father, who wasn't arrested either. Awesome.  Remember when Qui-Gon Jinn died near the beginning of Star Wars Episode One?  Yeah, no one else cared about that either. Same actor, same result.Story Five: Scarily Underweight White Girl With A Smile That's Too Giant And Creepy Like A Picket Fence marries a black dude in a heartwarming (not) ceremony and Black Man Dude's best man seems to be the jealous, and we all think he's totally gay and wanted Black Man all to himself, then it turns out he's actually in love (love, actually) with Skinny Chick even though HE has also not had any type of relationship with her other than hanging out with her and Black Dude, but hey- everyone in this movie is impossible- and the resolution for this story is that he rings their doorbell, she answers, he tells her to remain silent while he expresses his love for her with cue cards (and she totally buys it) while her brand new husband is upstairs watching TV and Skinny keeps the whole thing secret, chasing Cue Card Monty down the street to kiss him then going back upstairs to tell Brand New Husband it was just carolers.  Where's Chubby with the F bomb? I need her.You know, there may be another story, I don't know.  This movie was 100% build-up to 7% resolution.  Slimy Harry Potter Guy and his wife's story was the one that really got me- Emma Thompson is the wife, and she's fabulous. She's the only character in the films I liked- and she got hammered the hardest.  The scumbags all won their little battles, and none of them deserved to.If you feel like you must see this- rent it.  Or borrow it.  In retrospect I'd hate to have wasted the trip to Redbox for it.You could wait for broadcast TV and see it, but after they edit all of the foul stuff out, the movie won't last more than 40 minutes.  This thing's gross, period.  And I'm not a southern preacher who's all huffy puffy- I enjoyed the hell out of Private Ryan: blood, gore, language, etc- but framed within reality.  I even love the Princess Bride with ROUS's and Miracle Max and his chocolate-coated Massive Pill, but it was clearly presented as a fairy tale.  Love Actually is a fairy tale presented as reality, but it's a slow, boring, pointless fairy tale like The Dark Crystal: I saw it and would rather that I had vacuumed the house. If you've seen The Dark Crystal, you know what I mean."	1.0	Filthy, boring, and vacant	2012-12-26	19	10	9

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2I6VNI75E7FLJ	timmers	I love the very beginning and the very end (seriously). The time in between was punctuated with some great acting. I like that it didn't try to resolve all the problems because the reality is that some are fixed easily and others are complicated. Laura Linney was the standout role for me. I dislike Hugh Grant's limited acting range, but I concede to enjoying him in this. Bill Nighy - can he do any wrong? He made a deplorable man quite lovable.For having a rock star cast, I would have liked a stronger script and fewer over-the-top moments. It's worth watching once, but nothing I need to own and I feel very disconnected to those I know who LOVE the movie.Overall message, despite being wrapped up too pretty, was that love stretches who you might/could be.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A14NA0W8ESGDSI	Timothy Lovett	One thing is clear about Love Actually, either you'll completely be blown away by it or you'll hate it.Personally I am of the former camp in regards to this movie. The characters have complex interactions and despite the seemingly unjoined stories you find bridges that connect characters left and right which unwind as the story develops.The movie also brings together many stories with both sad and happy endings depicting all the aspects of relationships which can be encountered.Not to mention the movie is hilarious. Hugh Grant's character is amazingly fun to watch and the character called Collin is insanely funny.All in all, I could go on for awhile about this film but I'll leave my comments at this. I could watch this film twice in the same week without losing interest in it. I can't say that about many other films.	5.0	Charming and Irresistible	2008-04-07	4	1	3

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A300AR4IM0KW21	Tom Chase	As christmas comedies go, Love Actually is among the best of all time. The film is just a great heart warming comedy for all the family (except maybe the eight year old, due to the occasional swear word, nothing too bad though). The cast is fantastic, one of my favorite actors, Liam Neeson has a major role as a father who's son has fallen in love with a girl at school, and he has to deal with the teenage traumas and does so in great style. The gentlemanly Hugh Grant who plays, well, himself as always, but also the Prime Minister. Bill Nighy, always very funny to watch, plays an old rock star trying to make it big again (another great rock film with Bill is Still Crazy, have a look). Martine McCutcheon also stars as Hugh Grants tea lady (obviously they fall in love too). Also worth mentioning is Colin Firth's performance, who after leaving his wife as she was having an affair, he goes to France for holiday and falls in love with his Portuguese maid.Overall a great combination of the best British actors around. Hugh Grant was great as the PM and had some very funny scenes but I think Bill Nighy stole the show, everytime he came up something hilarious happens!

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3L8CZT6T4K4PC	Toni Kamsler	But it was released at Christmastime, has a holiday theme, a feel-good montage at the end... of course it's a little schmaltzy. On the other hand, it's a lovely romantic comedy in the Bridget Jones/Four Weddings and a Funeral tradition -- even complete with Hugh Grant proving he just can't shake that adorably pink-cheeked thing he has, whether he's playing the shy young fellow, the basta*d boyfriend, or the Prime Minister.But -- it's not *just* a chick flick. Okay, the Keira Knightly plot and the Colin Firth bit, that was all pretty standard. Liam Neeson gave a wonderful performance but his girl-obsessed yet oddly-not-mourning-his-mum son was a bit off. Still, how many feel-good movies can boast the inclusion of a couple who meets while simulating sex, a sex-crazed fellow who finds bliss in Milwaukee, an oddly warming story about an over the hill rocker, and Emma Thompson, glorious in her non-gloriousness?So, yes, of course it has the obligatory soundtrack, the corny moments, the schmaltz at the end. There are also quite a few funny bits along the way. Personally, I'm adding this one to the holiday repetoire, for annual enjoyment.	4.0	Yes, of course it's a bit schmaltzy	2004-05-27	2	1	1

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AX6I7OABQ3D1R	Tonnvane Wiswell	"Humorously enough, the movie was exactly the kind of product described by the washed up rock star character who'd butchered his classic oldie (turning it into a holiday song) to try to get just a little more money out of the system: a golden turd.  While the audience I was with got a lot of chuckles out of this story, the whole thing felt really cobbled together and insubstantial. It's a shame because there really were so many great actors in this movie - and yet none of them seemed to have any more than just cameo bits. It just felt like such a ""product"" - with nudity for pleasure and little kiddies dancing and singing for sentiment. On the other hand, there's not much terribly wrong with being pleasant and meaningless, despite the fact that you will doubtfully forget you ever saw this movie about five minutes after you walk out of the theater. Too bad - writer/director Richard Bean had such originality with ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" Maybe he, like the rock star character he created, is hoping that a hit will help him hook a chippie so he can have a happy holiday. It'll make a good rental.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R	Traveler	"There are several moments in ""Love Actually"" which make it clear that this is a British movie and not an American one. It's as if they combined ""Notting Hill"" with splashes of ""A Fish Called Wanda"" or ""Monty Python"" and maybe even a drop or two of ""Benny Hill."" For an American audience this means that the movie will be at times funny and romantic, at others perplexing if not even offensive (to some).Many of the criticisms of this movie seem to be coming from the American perspective. It's true, the whole faux sex (while naked) thing between one couple is something you wouldn't see in American film. The art gallery with sexual images is yet another example. It's hard to believe that Americans would find any of this even remotely romantic.A lot of ""Love Actually"" is a statement about the British feelings toward the US. It's obvious that quite a few Brits find it amusing that some American women will go ga-ga over a British accent, regardless of the attractiveness of the bloke speaking.The most ignorant criticism of this movie, however, is the anger about what some think is an ""anti-Americanism"" because the prime minister (Hugh Grant's character) stands up to the US president. Some have foolishly suggested that this was some sort of of left wing agenda on the producers part. I can only assume that such viewers don't access the news beyond Fox or their local paper.Several polls have shown a majority of people on the planet, including in Britain, do not trust Bush. More importantly for this film, soon after 9-11 the British public, while sympathetic to US citizens, believed that Prime Minister Tony Blair was like ""George Bush's poodle."" A majority of British citizens did NOT support Blair and saw him as a kiss-up to Bush. The director of ""Love Actually"" was no fool. He or she knew that British audiences wanted a leader who would stand up for Britain and not blindly follow the US. So the director simply gave them what they wanted. (Btw, it's not that Thorton is supposed to be Bush.  Rather, he simply represents US arrogance.)  If some viewers don't like that, well, maybe they need to figure out why British citizens feel that way. You can't blame the director.""Love Actually"" is a very funny movie and it is, at times, romantic. However, it is a movie with British sensibilities.  It is not for those with conservative tastes regarding sexuality (especially interracial) or those who can't deal with how many people in the world view the US."	4.0	A movie with British sensibilities that will offend some Americans	2005-07-17	14	11	3
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2Z1OFP7850LW2	"Trevor D. Hoier ""thoier"""	"It was humiliating enough knowing I was scammed into ""actually"" watching this thing, but this was one troublesome movie.  I know it was also critically acclaimed and it even won some awards for comedic screenplay at the Golden Globes. Here are a few things about a little film I like to call, ""Actually...It's A Mess""1.  Could there be any more characters in this movie?  There are so many people falling in love here that (on two occassions) they simply forget about them and bring them back into the story over an hour later.2.  Nice stereotype of the US President.  He's southern, he's drunk, he's a womanizer.3.  The guy who moronically proposes to the Portugeuse woman at the end....what was his deal?  At the beginning we see him get out of bed with his girlfriend or wife to go write a book and then he falls in love with a woman he can't even communicatewith just because he sees her in blue panties on a dock after she ruins everything he's written?4.  Alan Rickman?  Umm...he's married, he flirts with his secretary twice in the movie, he's married.  He buys a necklace from Mr. Bean.  Emma Thompson (his wife) suspects he's cheating but absolutely nothing is resolved.  Are they together, arethey not?  She cries at a school play and then kisses him and says she's happy to see him at the airport.  Huh?  And the last time we see his secretary is when she opens the door in heart patterned underwear for the Prime Minister.  What a disaster.5.  The American girl who is in love with the guy who talks like Ingrieke Iglecias...what was up with that?  We're tortured having to listen to her talk to her boss abouthow much she loves this guy.  Finally, we're spared from the agony and they dance, disrobe and lie on the bed...then her braindead brother calls and calls again.  The story is thankfully put on the backburner as they sit by the bed before she goes to the hospital.  The last we see of it is her at her work desk and saying good night to Ingrieke Boy late at night.  She cries.  What the f??6.  Talk about a completely useless character.  Her brother sits in Santa hats and tries to punch her when she sees her.  It makes no sense because her relationship problem isn't resolved.  If it's a love story and she can't fall in love becauseshe has to look after her mentally ill brother and talk to him over and over and over again on her annoying cellular phone, there really isn't a point to that situation, is there?7.  Hugh Grant is a likeable enough fellow.  My problem with him is that he plays every character as the same guy.  I was embarrassed for him after he danced to The Pointer Sisters.  I also thought him telling off the US President at a Press Conference had virtually nothing to do with his character....at all.  That was a cheap shot at the United States.8.  Liam Neeson's ugly kid.  The kid was a little weasel who never combed his hair.  There's no way anyone would find him remotely interesting or attractive. He dresses like a homeless orphan and it would be nice to think the kid could thinkof his mother who just passed away as opposed to some Alicia Keyes looking bimbo.  When you look back on it, he wasn't even sad at his mother's funeral.  He was thinking about the American girl.  Also, good parenting allowing him to run through a security checkpoint, Dad.9.  The kid ran at least six miles to get to the gate, even though he had no way of knowing what airline she was flying or what gate it could have possibly been. Why is it that once he's brought all the way back to his father, the American girlis right behind them and she kisses him?  Her flight was on a final boarding call in the first place.10.  Claudia Schiffer can't act....and she only had one line in the entire movie.11.  The whole English Girl marry's black Englishman attracted to black Englishman's Best Man was completely ignored.  He confesses how he feels for a married woman. She's touched.  They forget about it all for fifty minutes.  They come back to itand he writes down a lot of really dumb messages on large poster board paper.  He was holding all of that stuff in his arms.  Wasn't he taking a huge risk that his buddy (black Englishman) might actually open the door?12.  Finally, mercifully, what in the ""Hell"" was going on with the two people insinuating sexual intercourse and oral on that stage/set?  That really made no sense and then they kiss at the end and she says, ""All I want for Christmas is you!""  ?????????

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A220FJEQNGMSRN	Trevor Willsmer	"Love Actually is a mixed bag set in that mythical London that only seems to exist in the imagination of Richard Curtis. As a director, Curtis gets poor performances out of the better actors (Neeson and Rickman in particular) and passable ones from the really bad ones (Keira Knightley, Martin Freeman, Sienna Guillory) but is generally best when leaving the others to do their regular schtick (Hugh Grant playing the world's least convincing British Prime Minister, Emma Thompson in a virtual reprise of her Tall Guy character and Colin Firth doing his usual constipated look routine). With such a large ensemble many get lost en route and too many of the stories go nowhere, but it does get there in the end despite your resistance. Some of the surprisingly strong deleted scenes on the DVD do hint at a much more ambitious film, and there is one remarkably effective moment with a shattered Thompson listening to a Joni Mitchell song that holds the moment longer than you'd think he'd dare, but in the end the temptation to give in to feelgood corn wins over, even if it is at the cost of the film's already very limited supply of credibility. But that kid does look like he should be in The Omen or Village of the Damned - every time I see him I keep on expecting him to say ""You are thinking of a brick wall."""	3.0	Not great, but not bad, actually	2007-05-19	5	4	1

There is a some partial nudity & a little rough language but the many individuals stories within the story line are interesting. This movie shows several different couples & the multitude of emotions they experience from and within marriage, meeting and falling in love with someone new,  betrayal and death of a loved one. It is interesting how all of the couples & their relationships are intertwined by friendship, family and/or common backgrounds.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A5CWLQF6QO3CN	"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B..."	From the first impression many people may think that Love Actually is just another romance comedy featuring Hugh Grant. However, if you skip it because of this reason, you could have missed out an absolutely fabulous movie.Love Actually is a movie about love could be found everywhere.The movie surrounds a couple of people who so happened to be related to each other in direct or indirect ways. The stories were weaved together very skilfully that you won't find them awkward with one another and the twists of plots are very clever. This is something that one might not expect as when it comes to multiple story lines in one single plot, the screenwriter might be too busy weaving things together and it could end up with multiple linear story lines and lack the depth of the 3rd dimension. However Love Actually was very well done in terms of screenplay and giving the audience numerous surprises to keep their attention level high.Since the movie is a multiple storyline one, so no particular person in the cast had a heavier coverage then others, this credit has to be given to the director and the editors I suppose. It was all well balanced and at the same time the whole cast gave a superb performance. Liam Neeson who played a step-father to a 11 year old step son whose mother just passed away gave all the delicate touch in dealing with the post funeral father-son relationship. The kitchen scene with Emma Thompson was a showcase with both just let the emotion flowed naturally without any pretentious acts.Hugh Grant, though still look very Hugh Grant gave a very good touch as the Prime Minister of UK. This sort of fulfilled some people's fantasy of having a celebrity as the head of the nation and Hugh Grant was a very unconventional Prime Minister. The part in the press conference is a landmark for his role in the movie as he delivered his political standing with enough humour that won't be insulting but passed the message through very well.  It was very well written indeed.There are many other stories which gave people a lot of memorable times. The English writier (Colin Firth) and the portugese maid part was so sweet in portraying an encounter that showed both sides were perfect match for each other but they just didn't know because of the language barrier. The way they tried to overcome this language barrier without even knowing whether they are going to meet again just gave the movie a very sweet and warm touch.The rock star part provided a huge injection of humour to the moive. And on the other hand the two subtle triangular relationships, one remained subtle and the other became a hidden current undermining the establishment also smartly showed how people deal with relationships when it comes to something that nobody wanted to happen.The actors stand-ins and the desinger and clerk parts were also very interesting.Love Actually is actually a movie of choice for the year. Like Amelie, it is a feel good movie and you would be able to enjoy it from the beginning till the very end. It has a superb cast, it was cleverly done and also it has a soundtrack that fits into the movie perfectly. It is a movie that gave the word Love a fair definition. It covers all the happy, sad and depressing situations of relationship, but at the same time it gives you the energy to stay in the relationship no matter what. If you are looking for a movie that you could enjoy for 2 hours and then after that still feel good when you think about it again, Love Actually is a definite choice.	5.0	Not any common romance comedy	2004-02-05	2	1	1

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	"[Actually, my rating is 3.5 stars.]No one can deny the fact that Richard Curtis is one of the best screenwriters in the world.  And yes, ""Love Actually"" confirms the fame again.  But as to his directoral skills, ""Love"" actually shows that it is short of the ones' such as Roger Mitchell who did in ""Notting Hill.""  In short, good, but not great.""Love Actually"" has many (including potential) couples in love, and too many, I am afraid.  Hugh Grant as Prime Minister of UK is in love with his chubby secretary while Emma Thompson plays a wife of Alan Rickman, in whose office Laura Linney works, who is in love with a hunky guy, and so on and on.  However, though the film includes the stars like Keira Knightley, Colin Firth, Rowan Atkinson, and Liam Neeson, the screentime alloted to each actor is too short for any character they play to fully engage our attentions.That does not mean the film is boring.  On the contrary, it has a lot of witty dialogues of Richard Curtis, the same kind of funny lines you enjoyed in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral.""  But as you keep watching on, you will probably some stories should be left in the cutting room.  Actually, two (or three) couples' stories are not interesting at all.  And the slightly political satire on the US-UK relation (represented awkwardly by the US President Billy Bob Thornton) clearly sticks out.  We need romance here, not political comments, even wrapped with laughter.Among the many actors, it is Bill Nighy who steals the show, as an ex-rocker whose acid tongue cannot be kept silent even on the air.  The way how this down-and-out, die-hard rocker sings his awful version of ""Love Is All Around"" (used in ""Four Wedding"" by Wet Wet Wet) is a real pleasure to see, and you can find him in every funny moment of the film.""Love Actually"" is too long, and its story clutters with too many characters.  It is a fun to see it, but no one would complain if Richard Curtis concentrate his enormous talent on writing only in the future."	4.0	Love Is All Around; Enjoyable, But Actually Too Much Around	2004-03-15	4	2	2
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3VDCAOV8TXK8D	T. T. Simons	An alright movie for a Sunday night, particuarly if you are curled up on the sofa with the 'other half' and some junk food, but not really a defining moment in cinema.One point of note for me, however, was the scene with Emma Thompson set to Joni Mitchell's incredibly poignant later version of Both Sides now. Suprisingly moving, to the point that it brought a tear to my eye! Her depiction of the mother that puts aside her feelings to ensure that her family are not affected by the heartache and betrayl she has discovered made me think of the countless times that my mother must have put on a brave face even though deep inside she may have been falling apart.	4.0	OK - for a sunday night	2006-05-26	3	2	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AVGGEAI1YGSAP	Tucker Andersen	"My rating is based on my enjoyment of this film. It has both major strengths and serious weaknesses, and as other reviews indicate has fostered very strong reactions, both positive and negative. Its format is somewhat disconcerting if you are not prepared for the methodology of the director. It contains nudity, profanity, sexual situations, and several situations that are very suggestive and some moviegoers may consider to border on the obscene. However, the situations that some people may consider offensive actually serve a purpose in developing the overall theme of the film.Love, in all its manifestations - wonder, joy, pain, happiness, passion, grief... is the theme of the film. A very talented ensemble cast is utilized to tell several somewhat interrelated stories concerning the emotional lives of the various characters. The cast includes Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney, Kiera Knightley and Alan Rickman. There are also telling cameos by Billy Bob Thornton and Rowan Atkinson. There is one other essential element of the story, it begins five weeks from Christmas and there are several aspects of the various vignettes where the seasonal aspect is a crucial element.One of the more interesting and complex stories involves Liam Neeson and his young stepson preparing for the funeral of his wife, which has been moving scripted by her prior to her death. As he subsequently tries to deal with his grief, he is worried about the fact that the boy is isolating himself in his room. He is surprised to discover that while his son is disconsolate at the loss of his mother, more importantly he is heartsick over his unrequited love for a girl with whom he attends school. As they concentrate on his son's dilemma and develop a plan to attract her attention, the dialog ranges from comic to quite profound. And, as the movie progresses to the time of the school Christmas pageant their story gradually becomes interwoven with several of the others. Some of the most hilarious segments are in another thread of the movie involving Bill Nighy as a washed up pop singer trying to recycle one of his old love songs as a Christmas record. He effectively caricatures the dissolute rockers who abused their bodies for too long with drugs, booze and sex. Yet in the end, the alternate humor and pathos of his situation are resolved in a very effective and quite emotional scene. In yet another thread, a scene with Emma Thompson listening to a Joni Mitchell recording and thinking about the ""both sides"" of her life and love is a real tearjerker.So this is a roller coaster of laughs and cheap humor combined with real insights about love and the pain that it can cause. If you aren't living in a bubble, you will probably relate to the experiences of at least one of the characters to some degree and knowingly nod in recognition of the similarities of others to people that you know. It is arguable whether the message of the film would be better conveyed with a fewer number of stories examined in somewhat more depth, but I think the result is quite powerful. Lives which seem only tangentially connected turn out to have a profound influence on others, and we really feel that we have come to understand the characters that we have been watching.My first difficulty with the movie is that the complexity of developing so many stories means that it is well over two hours long (with the previews and unconscionable ads we were in the theater for well over two hours). Second, the audience is introduced to a very large number of characters during a very short period of time, since all the stories are interspersed sequentially as the movie proceeds toward Christmas Day. Very few individual segments until the finale are more than three or four minutes in length. However, the disorientation that I felt at first from the constant scene shifts was offset by the fact that this technique was successful in keeping the audience very interested; the film actually seemed shorter than it was because of the constant action. So, it was fun while actually conveying a message at the same time. I also want to see it again, since this is the type of movie that I often enjoy more during subsequent viewings. I find that once I know the basic story line and the relationship of the various characters, I can then pay attention to a lot of the details that went were difficult to appreciate because there was so much constantly happening during the film. (In fact, as I was thinking about the film prior to writing this review a few such instances came to mind.) So, go see this film when you have time to relax and want to laugh and contemplate life for a few hours.Tucker Andersen"	4.0	"(4+) Actually Quite Entertaining but Definitely Deserves ""R"""	2003-11-12	226	178	48

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2RG58GDF2OUE1	"VAB ""vaberella"""	First off I would like to say the film is really superb.  I mean you've seen teh reviews others, I'm sure, and you've heard what other's say.  I do beleive everyone should see it for themselves.  It's a movie that you can watch with 10 people or just yourself and the state of mind is to be pretty welcoming.This is very different than the the director's other films like 4 Weddings and a Funeral, or Bridget Jones.  Both of which I'm not a fan of.  Hugh Grant is like a character which is a mix of both those guys in either film.  His character is the Prime MInister of the time and is very funny.  I was a bit disconcerted by the fact it was a woman that made the Prime Minister take a stand, but hey what ever floats the boat.  Love can make you do many things....look at Napolean and Josephine or Antony and Cleopatra.But what I just have to say is that it's a romantic comedy which is far from the normal sap that we see in a lot of American crap.  Their's a different feel in how the romance is portrayed and expressed.  Your not like....oh that's so sweet.  Your laughing at their bumbling and women can feel the passion not only from the men but also from the men.  An expression or a word or somethign is used just to show what they want.  This is far from the ordinary chick flick, as men can relate on more than one ground with any of the male character's.I normally don't like films or books for that matter that have more than one romance for the only reason that people can't carry it.  Authors fail miserably and film makers are idiots about it.  But I must say this director or producer carries it off very well in this film.  You get the backgrond of everyone where their coming from, past relations and what their making of the future...and it's hilarious.Now this last statement is for the person who was making statments about the politicasl theme.  Dont' believe them, the person made it seem that the entire film was a some of kind of political statement to the world.  Bull, only one scene and not that memorable.  I'm an american who lived in Britain so yeah I know both histories and politics very very very well.The movie does take a jab at America...but it's rather interesting.  This woman was saying how insulting they were.  In actuallity not only are they righth about the way America is expressed in the nation...this is coming from someone who doesn't know politics, though.  America is classed as a bully.  But in most instances Britian has it's head up American ass.  But I can say this right now.  But one this is for sure....America would never mess with it's alliance with Britain.  Why?  It loses Britain it loses Europe, in losing Europe they lose Russia, and the countries of the former USSR, then they lose the Caucas, at losing the these parts, they lose Mediterranean and massive parts of Asia.  China never really liked us anyway.  Then there's Africa...and since Europe has the majority of the military there....we've lost Africa and hence then we've lost the Eastern and Western Hemisphere leaving us as Americans with only South America.  Why?  Because we've then lost many British Caribbean Islands and french Islands, and we've lost our alliance with Canada.  So for the person who feels that in some way that the film was insulting, get over it.  If your an overzealous patriot, then this is definiely not for you.  But if your an average person who doesn't swing politically anywhere or your a liberal who knows that a movie is just a movie then go for it...and you shouldn't even be wanting to Turn Away!  The film is excellent political statement or not.And if you can't put a political theme in a movie where can you put it.  IT's like them Mississippi Burning shouldn't have been a movie made...racism exists, politics exist.  Adn much like media...film is a way to express what you want and do what you want.  There is no right or wrong place...you just do it.  And I think the director/writer/producer's did an excellent job on what's going on!!Anyway I think all of you wil enjoy it!Peace!	5.0	Hey....It's now my most favorite film....	2004-12-01	8	4	4
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A1631PDU0WGN4W	Vahania63	The movie consists of quite a few sub-plots, where characters in which of them are somehow connected. The director put together great great actors but it seems like each sub-plot was directed by different person so uneven they are. It ranges from very funny stories of aging rock star or british guy going to Wisconsin because American girls like british guys, to cheesy story of relationship between father and son after the death of boy's mother, to totally predictable story of love of british prime minister (played by Hugh Grant) to the lady on his stuff.

This is actually part of the bonus footage. I thought for sure then when it was time to release this film on dvd the director would lovingly restore the chopped footage back as part of the movie since it was clear during his narrative that he only removed some of these scenes to shorten the film. Sadly, this is not the case. The movie is still just slightly over two hours and while it works, it would have been slightly more enjoyable with the bonus footage added back into the original film to make the ""ultimate"" Love Actually Directors Cut. Maybe he's be reading my comments or someone else's and release a directors cut bluray in a few more years. That would truly be the icing on top. However, don't let my comments put you off.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A3Q7DPS8UFNTRG	Venus A. Rachal	"This movie has passion, tenderness, poignancy, and humor. You are exposed to people of different classes, ethnicities, and general backgrounds in order to take a closer look at what ""love"" is.You see the arrogant ex-rock star (Bill Nighy) trying to make a comeback and any cost and is chubby but likeable manager who is always there to support him. There's a prime minister (Hugh Grant) who is torn about his feelings for Natalie (Martine McCutcheon), the inconveniently beautiful head of his catering staff. After going through a horrible break up, we watch a B novelist (Colin Firth) discover love while writing his novel in France. Then there are married couples, best friends, siblings, parents, and children. As you can tell, the cast is top notch. It's a veritable who's who of British Cinema and every part is played to perfection.What this movie does is to show how we have incredibly human experiences that tie us into something deeper. Sometimes, there is incredible pain and loss when we fall in love--or out of love--but no matter what happens, love strengthens us and reminds us that we are alive.The DVD is fabulous because there are tons of extras in it. I've had the joy of watching it all and I love it. If you like Sam and  Daniel (the father and son), you'll love the full cut of their story. There is actually 8 minutes of Sam, most of which was not in the theatrical film. I won't give away what's in it, but that is my top pick of extras to watch from the DVD. There are also hilarious bits if you watch the version of the movie with audio commentary by the director and several cast members. Hugh Grant is particularly funny in this, particularly when he talks about Colin Firth! If you are a lover of soundtracks, there is also a good section where the director goes into detail about each of the primary songs he picked in the film and why.If you enjoyed this movie, buy it!!

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A2H5R22FYZF770	vizwhiz	"This movie was recommended by a coworker as a great little Christmas movie to watch every year. We're not big movie watchers so we enjoy finding good movies to watch if we're going to watch one (even if we are ten years behind). With all the big name stars in this one, we thought that it had to be pretty good, so we took the recommendation and rented it.We were very disappointed. The very loosely- connected stories were so transparently just a way to get that many big name stars in one movie during their high popularity era without having any one billed higher than another that it made you wonder why the writer didn't just make more movies out of the best of the subplots. Then the subplots...many were blatantly meaningless excuses to get the highly-rated actors into the movie, and added so little to the overall picture or the main plot that they were distracting from the few subplots that did have some depth. And depth seems to be the thing the movie lacked the most of... It was mostly a lot of good actors doing a good job of portraying their typical ""movie self"" in an otherwise weak movie. And while British movies often are laced with enough British humour to keep you chuckling, this movie had so little of that that you quit waiting for it. Add gratuitous nudity and bad language just to try to keep the watcher's attention because there's no other reason to watch this or that particular scene, and this pretty well sums up the two-plus hour long movie. If you just wanted to see some of your favorite actors/actresses all in one movie, here ya go."	2.0	Disappointed	2012-12-31	3	2	1
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	ASJ89T42CIUHU	V. Marshall	"""Love Actually"" is the perfect feel good movie for anyone who has ever felt the innocence and pitter-patter of butterflies in your stomach as you fall in love.This British film starts out a little shaky until you get involved with the stories behind all of the eight couples who will weave their way into the hardest of hearts. The movie contains many well known actors like Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Laura Linney and Colin Firth as well as a few cameos. It is well written and somehow all of the interesting characters end up just as they should.Hugh Grant plays the British Prime Minister who falls in love with his assistant and as usual he is adorable and quirky, especially during his solo dance scene. Emma Thompson plays a wife who exists in a 13 year marriage believing it to be perfect until an unexpected Christmas gift from her husband ends up being for someone else. Your heart will break as she pulls herself together while Joni Mitchell sings softly in the background, ""Both Sides Now."" Liam Neeson is a recent widower who spends the film helping his adolescent son cope with his first case of puppy love....really adorable and holding all of the innocence that young love somehow always contains. Laura Linney is the ever responsible sister of a handicapped brother who is never able to break herself away from her duties in order to pursue her love interest, although she reaches that pinnacle of greatest accomplishment in unrequited love, that perfect moment where it all appears to work. Colin Firth is a writer who falls in love with a foreign maid while trying to work. His pursuit is both funny and touching as he learns another language and obviously does not master it while pulling an entire little town into his pursuit of love and relays the fact that love really can cross those awkward barriers. All of the rest of the stories are just as intriguing and often times gut wrenching for romantics.A perfect film to watch when love treats you wrong and you need to feel right. You will be reminded of all those simple treats that come with love. From innocent starry-eyed puppy love all the way through to a lengthy marriage that is safe and secure despite the wretched boredom. It shows you that love can work and even if it doesn't another flicker will always come along if you let it. The soundtrack is its own character as great background music influences many of the scenes. It is corny, campy, silly, touching, at times stiff and then again provocative....its actually all that love is in all of its various shapes and forms."	5.0	Actually All That Love Should Be!	2004-07-13	3	0	3

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	Charming and funny Love Actually deals with parallel plots lines involving a wide variety of characters. It turns out that most of the characters are connected through someone or something (a wedding, a school play). Liam Neeson takes center stage with the touching story of a step-father who just widowed. He's unsure about his relationship with his 10 year old step son because the center of his universe has been taken from him. Neeson plays a wide variety of emotions in the role written with the most depth.Colin Firth stars as a writer who ends up going to a friend's wedding alone. It seems his wife is under the weather. He returns home early to discover his younger brother at his house although he's surprised, he's even more surprised when it's clear his wife is having an affair with his brother. After splitting up with his wife he finds romance in the most unlikely of places; he's staying at his vacation residence and finds it with his housekeeper. The only catch is that they don't speak each other's langauge but still manage to discover each other.In the funniest bit Bill Nighy stars as washed up rocker Billy Mack. Mack is on the come back trail with a awful remake of The Troggs' song Love is All Around reimagined as a Christmas ditty. Mack hates the song and knows its a piece of garbage but he also recognizes this is a last chance for him and his manager. Nighy captures the larger than life Mack to a t. His love story isn't about finding the perfect mate but, instead, about his friendship with his manager/producer and how he discovers that friendship, loyalty and truth outclass the fame game.Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson play a married couple whose relationship is comfortable. Unfortunately, Harry's (Rickman) new secretary at the magazine he works at has the hots for him. She makes it very clear and Harry's very tempted. This is one of the more emotionally rich bits in the film as well.Finally there's the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) who can't find love. Or rather, he finds it at the wrong time with the wrong person. He's fallen head over heels with one of his staff Natalie (Martine McCutcheon). Clearly the relationship would be complicated. He's unsure what to do about it despite the fact that he's fallen hopelessly in love with her.The most unusual subplot involves a pair of stand-in's for actors. The twist is that they are stand in's for actors in what appears to be a soft porn movie. Their banter is innocent and despite the awkwardness of the situation, they both are attracted to each other.Writer/Director Richard Curtis does a fine job of integrating the complex, interweaving story lines. He contrasts the relationships nicely and in such a way that they different relationships and the steps they are at comment on the other, more advanced ones. All the performers are marvelous and, while it won't win any Oscars, Love Actually is a fun bit of fluff that allows all the actors involved to give strong at times whimsical performances.Be forewarned, though that the nudity (and language)during the story with the actor's stand ins may be a bit much for older folks and totally inappropriate for young teens. It's rated R for a reason--it's a romantic comedy but with a decidely adult edge. More than likley you wouldn't want to take your Mother to this although a wife, lover or close friend would make great company.Love Actually is entertaining and funny. It's also a tonic to all the Gen-X generated action adventure films and high concept garbage that studios usually churn out during the Holiday season.	4.0	Pleasing comedy about romance and sex	2003-11-30	9	5	4

I liked every single storyline except the one with the guy who goes to Wisconsin and the porn players.  What's amazing about this movie is that they packed it with a lot of famous stars (Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Keira Knightly, Laura Linney etc.).  I doubt it can be replicated now due to the cost but this is the perfect rom com.  Garry Marshall only wished he did it better with V-Day and New Year's Eve or whatever that one was called.The ones that made me teary eyed was Colin Firth and Liam Neeson's storylines.

Hugh Grant plays, of all things, the newly elected British Prime Minister, a bachelor who secretly wonders whether he can really do the job. But the plot goes well beyond Number Ten...to a hodgepoge of different people, young and old, who are grappling with love in all its forms.We have two young and innocent porn stars (a hilarious thought in itself) who shyly fall in love while nudely achieving the most unabandoned coupling in front of cameras and film crew. There is a mystery writer who suddenly finds himself alone at Christmas, and escapes to Portugal only to fall in love with his gorgeous young housekeeper--who speaks not a word of English. There is the recent widower (played poignantly by Liam Neeson) who must help his 10-year-old stepson through his own agonizing love affair and the loss of his mum...and so on and so on and so on...until the movie reaches its star comic turn: Bill Nighy as a washed-up, drugged-up, almost brain-dead former pop idol whose horrible remake of an old hit (""Love Is All Around You"") hits the airwaves just in time for Christmas.As the old goat makes the rounds of the talk shows and pop TV venues, he speaks his mind--and then some. Truly a star turn for Nighy, who is absolutely hilarious.OK, you might gather I loved this movie. And so I did. If it was the old days, where you paid for your ticket and had the right to sit in the theater all day long, I would have done so. I don't think I can wait another week before seeing it again.

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A15XXOVX6ZNNRO	"William D. Shingleton ""Wishful Thinking Is No..."	Love Actually is one of the better romantic comedies to come out in recent years.  The concept of interlocking love stories is relatively fresh, though not totally unique.  In this case it is will done, and Richard Curtis deserves credit for working in platonic love (i.e., between friends) and love ending as well as stories of new and unrequited love.  The film moves along quickly and has enough light moments that it will be entertaining to both male and female viewers, though it has segments that are definately not appropriate for children.Love, Actually is anchored by a stellar cast of true actors such as Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, and Emma Thompson.  Both Thompson and Bill Nighy should have gotten Oscar nominations for two very different roles - Thomson as the wife losing her husband's love, Nighy as a has-been rock star who can't keep his mouth from getting him in trouble.  The cast is deep and clearly was having a good time shooting the film.  Frankly, I am not a Hugh Grant fan and I still liked both the film and the character that he played.The DVD has several special features worth watching, starting with a commentary with several of the stars and the director.  If you listen to it you will find out that Rowan Atkinson was supposed to play the angel of love in the film, but that his role was reduced.  This probably made the film more coherent, but that doesn't alter the fact that his scenes are some of the funniest in the movie.  The deleted scenes, while understandably not in the film, are also worth perusing.The only negative thing I have to say about this film is that it originated the strange idea that Wisconsin is America's romance capital, with one of the characters travelling there on the theory that American girls will find his British accent irresistable (this idea also pops up in The Prince and Me for some reason).  The problem is that he walks into a bar with Anheusuer Busch advertising all over the place, which is blasphemy in the land of Miller beer.  This is a quibbling detail, but will be amusing to the Cheeseheads out there.Overall, the film is entertaining and accessable accross gender lines, and will be worth the money and time spent for an adult audience.	5.0	A Good Adult Romantic Comedy	2005-03-06	12	10	2

B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	A332SN5GSXCJ9R	W. Villanueva	Let me start by saying that the cast was impressive and that was the main reason for watching this movie. How bad could it be?This movie goes all over the place. The characters are not developed and therefore we are left empty and not caring one bit for these people. One reason I believe we don't connect is that there are way too many couples in this movie. Don't get me wrong the movie has potential but how can we possibly feel for over sixteen people when it's only a two hour movie?The only couples I feel that needed more attention were: Emma Thompson's charcter and husband, Laura Linney and the guy she had a crush on. If you watch the movie you'll understand why. Emma's character has a stronger story and Laura Linney's character had to deal with an emotionally unbalanced and needy brother. We could have seen more as to how she was going to deal with this and still have a life.All other characters were wasted and pointless. Such a great castwasted on this nonsense.	1.0	Emotionally Detached	2004-08-06	56	29	27

I'm sure there were some sleepless nights where he had to decide if he wanted to play that role or not. The only qualm I have with the film is that it portrarys America in a quite sleazy vein by making Billy Bob Thornton the president and having him hit on an intern, but I guess that was Bill Clinton's come-uppin's for what he did. I thought the world had gotten over that but maybe I was wrong. It gave Grant the chance to give what was probably the best speech in the movie though about defending Britain and it may be small but it can stand up for it's convictions, etc... I didn't quite understand a scenario where two peolpe met in what seemed a [hot] movie set. It was while I was watching the behind-the-scenes that I learned these two people were movie ""stand-in's"" for other movie stars...I think. Hugh Grant proves once more that one of the tried and true ways of being charming on film is 1. always have the perfect bedhead, 2. act like you're stumbling your way through life, and 3. have a british accent doing it."	4.0	I actually love...this review I wrote	2004-06-10	4	1	3
B00005JMFQ	Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)	AMMEMPM9MPS55	www.DavidLRattigan.com	"There is no denying that Love Actually is a very entertaining film. There are some very funny moments, often genuinely witty and warm, and the cast, for the most part, is first-class. The nowadays more mature Hugh Grant is no longer the annoying foppish twit he was earlier in his career, and actually manages to be quite endearing. Martine McCutcheon--already known to British audiences as a TV soap star, and certainly not an actress I would have deliberately chosen to see--turns in a serendipitously understated performance. She delivers what could have been some very tedious comedy episodes (such as the early ""Oops, I just said sh*t twice,"" scene) in a surprisingly low-key manner. Also worth noting is Bill Nighy as an aging rocker, who has some of the film's funniest lines.Curtis brings a number of strands of plot together (the cast is huge, and many of the different storylines do not interconnect until well into the film), connecting them up in some very clever ways at times. However, it doesn't always work. At least two or three of the subplots could have been dispensed with altogether--they simply don't engage us or make sense.Lastly, there is no doubt the film is an emotional rollercoaster. You'll be fighting back the tears at times. The most emotional moments, however, arise from the filmmakers' shameless manipulation of the audience: The most banal and embarrassingly lazy cliches surface regularly to tug on our heartstrings; the score periodically swells into patriotic fervour or overblown sentimentalism to wrench our innermost feelings out of us. The British journalist Will Self furiously called the opening sequence, during which Hugh Grant refers to the phone calls from the planes to loved ones on 9/11, ""the most grotesque and sickening manipulation of the cinema audience since Leni Riefenstahl's [Nazi propaganda film] Triumph of the Will."" A bit of wild overstatement, perhaps, but not totally removed from the truth. Get your audience thinking back to all those images of people weeping and embracing after 9/11, and you'll have them eating out of the palm of your hand should you want to feed them a message of ""love, love, love,"" no matter how trite the means.What saves this film is that, apart from the triteness, there are some genuinely moving moments: The scene when wrinkled rockstar Bill Nighy confesses his love for his ""chubby employee""; when recently wedded Kiera Knightley watches her friend's video of the wedding and makes a startling discovery. There are also some genuinely funny moments, even if Curtis more than occasionally gives in to the temptation to sink into the predictable. And finally, there are some very clever moments, when Curtis does actually manage to defy our expectations and deliver something other than what we wanted or anticipated. Beneath the banal, there really is some warmth.Go on, suspend your critical judgment for the evening. I am not convinced it is all love, actually. It's entertainment, actually."	3.0	Entertaining (if you can suspend your critical judgment)	2003-12-06	3	2	1
