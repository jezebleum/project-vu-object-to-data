0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A26090C7U3P1J	2 Fires	What can I say? The beautiful Patrick Swazy in his prime. A wonderful coming of age love story. This movie is a must if you are having a &#34;middle age&#34; slumber party. Loved it...again and again.	5.0	The Perfect Chick Flix	2014-05-14	0	0	0
0784010218	Dirty Dancing	AIJ3JAT8596TA	A. Browning	This is a great edition of the classic Dirty Dancing. It has a TON of special features including music videos of the 3 most popular songs and a full length Dirty Dancing concert. And of course the regular interviews and retrospectives. I am a little disapointed however. Patrick Swayze is not interviewed AT ALL and the only actor they talk to is Jennifer Grey. I would have liked to see interview with other characters and the writer talk more about how she wrote the movie. The other disk is of course the great movie! No complaints about that. Even with some missing features, still the best edition around.	4.0	For the Ultimate fan!!! But where's Patrick Swayze???	2005-08-19	4	4	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A174UI1PG97RCI	acii	I come across this movie once every year or two. Same magic all the time.Two actors develop great chemistry, unbelievably spirited dancing that I ineptly enjoyed decades ago, a bit of politically incorrect drama for it's time and marvelous scenery.Can't forget to mention the music and a supporting cast that were as real as they were corny.No matter what else he might have done, with 'Dirty Dancing' Patrick left us all a gift that few could ever match.	5.0	A great love story	2014-03-16	0	0	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2BRBP15YNSQDT	A. Davis	Catchy music, beautiful storyline, amazing dance moves, Patrick Swayze.....there is so much to love about 'Dirty Dancing'. After all these years, it still remains a firm favourite. I was thrilled when I received my Limited Keepsake Edition on blu ray, and the quality of the movie on blu ray did not disappoint. The box the set came in is so sweet and holds all the pieces perfectly. Also it looks great on my movie shelf....Bonus! :)	5.0	Still a favourite	2012-06-26	2	2	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2G9RJWT356PZB	A Diehard Dirty Dancing Fan	My review is actually about the DVD itself, not so much the movie.  The movie, if anyone reading this has actually not seen it (!), is so bad its great!  There are so many things to love about this movie, from the dialogue (bad but campy) to the acting (acceptable) to the plot (nostalgic) to the dancing (great) to the love story (somewhat engaging) etc. etc.The DVD itself, however, is supposed to contain additional scenes and material that the avid fan of this movie could not be too excited about.  Well, perhaps my expectations were too high, but I expected outtakes and interviews that just did not exist.  The bios I can get anywhere, and the additional scenes I had seen before.  There is nothing added to this DVD that makes it &quot;collectible&quot;.  The movie itself is enough!	3.0	Gotta love it	2001-05-16	2	1	1
0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	ADRIENNE MILLER	Dirty Dancing (20th Anniversary Edition) is still the best and sexiest dance film I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey sizzle, smolder, and set the screen on fire with their undeniable chemistry. It's kinda funny since both stars couldn't stand each other off camera. I am so glad I waited 'til this new edition came out, great special features. Watch the deleted scene where they really dirty dance in Swayze's bungalow, it's hot, hot, hot!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie is a classic and everyone should own this tender film about first love, trusting those you're afraid to trust, and having the time of your life. I highly recommend it!	5.0	"""I carried a watermelon?"""	2007-05-30	35	32	3
0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A1310297SD66EI	afcrazygenie@yahoo.com	This is my favourite movie of all time.  I must've seen it at least 50 times, and I never tire of it.  The chemistry between Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey has never been captured by any other onscreen duo, in my opnion.  The music from the movie takes you back in time, and the dancing is such a pleasure to watch.  You see romance unfold as Baby learns how to dance from Johnny.  Patrick Swayze plays the &quot;bad boy&quot; with a soft center and Jennifer Grey plays the naive rich girl.  It's a must see for die hard romance lovers.	5.0	A Timeless Classic	2000-11-06	4	4	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	AW6LSPX2BIUK0	Agnes S.	I have been watching this movie since i was 9 years old (which wasn't so long ago) and I have loved it all those years. This movie makes me feel so romantic and in love that I sometimes cry! Baby and Johnny are in such love  that I always wish I had something like that. I love all the music and my  favorite part is at the end when they dance the last dance ! They do such a  good job it's phenomenal, and it wouldn't be if they weren't the ones doing  it. If you love to watch good movies you have to see this. Even if you  don't like romantic movies you have to see this.

Pearl ""Film Purist...And Snob"""	"Usually this comment is reserved for a...well, a girl, but I'm a guy with a sensitive side that emulated Patrick Swayze from the moment I saw this back in '87. Anyway on May 8th, Lions Gate is finally making amends for all the so-called ""Ultimate"" and ""Special"" and ""Collector's"" editions of this film that have been released on DVD since the format was first created back in '96. None of them have the features that we've wanted. Now, it's too early to say exactly what is going to be on the disc(s), but I read on the website The Digital Bits [...] under their Archived My Two Cents, that the new edition will have all-new features including new interviews with Patrick Swayze and...the best thing on this new edition that none of the other editions had...Deleted/Extended Scenes. Did anybody even know that there were scenes left on the cutting room floor? I sure didn't! I'm extremely excited to see what was omitted. I can only hope that Patrick Swayze & Jennifer Grey get together to record a commentary for the film...then it truly will be a Collector's Edition/Special Edition/Ultimate Edition. We'll have to wait and see, but so far I think there's good reason to be excited if you're a Dirty Dancing/Patrick Swayze/Jennifer Grey fan."	5.0	Dirty Dancing Fans, MARK YOUR CALENDARS!!!!!!!!!	2007-03-21	13	10	3

I hope if they do decide to re-make this movie they keep they same story line and keep it in the original order of the movie. Unlike the new Footloose movie it bounces all of over the place they should have stuck to the script like the old Footloose instead of moving things around like they did. Honestly I hope they don't touch this movie. Especially now that Patrick Swayze is longer living. It would be a shame to see a movie he helped with the chorography on get ruined by someone who thinks they need to ruin it to make it better.	5.0	Best Movie Ever	2014-04-30	0	0	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A3CPVX9VFC2M2Q	AMay	I thought I had seen all the 80's dance movies such as Flashdance, Footlose, and a few others. I like them and see them once a year but Dirty Dancing IS AN AWESOME MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The music is good, I daresay the acting is good, and I must be turning into my mom but Patrick was kinda a cutie in this movie, despite how in his recent movies he looks really really bad. If your a teenager who liked Save the Last Dance or Honey gove this a try, the daning and music is better than any other dance flick.	5.0	Hungry Eyes For Dirty Dancing	2006-01-02	0	0	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	AXPAIEE0732A9	Amazon Customer	I bought this for my GF as she loves this movie and I love her.That said... Why do women love this movie sooo much????  It is terrible... It is basically about a bunch of drunk bums that take dancing WAY too seriously for no reason... They sit around being emo, dancing, drinking, and apparently hooking up a lot.  Whenever I think of this movie I think about the scene where the main character chick is asking her dad for money for the secret abortion, and the dad is all &#34;I can never trust you again...&#34;, it's stupid.  Maybe Patrick Swayze, and his whole troop of bubs should put together a few bucks each and pay for the damn abortion instead of involving the main character chick.  If the movie was just about their romance and practicing for the big dance-off at the end, then I might like this movie more.  But the stupid needing money for abortion depression angle is just stupid and pointless IMHO.  I am not against crazy 80's dance movies, I dig a few of the other ones.  Anyways, women are crazy...

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2KN13086SJIMK	Amma	"Prior to Dirty Dancing, I've only seen Patrick in Red Dawn and Uncommon Valor where I found his acting marginal at best and his look somewhat common.  I had no intention of seeing this movie when, as a teen, my mom dragged me kicking and screaming to the movie theatre.  After Johnny and Penny danced their mambo together I was hooked and have loved him ever since.  He was simply to die for! There is just something so sensually mouthwatering about a man trained in dance and who would have though Patrick Swayze could dance or act?  Yes he does do a decent job acting in this movie.  Turns out he's been doing the wrong type of films.  Its too bad he hasn't done more dancing/romantic lead acting, as it seems to fit his brooding demeanor and look very well.Simply one of the best movies out there.  Great theme, great look, great dancing, great music, not to mention one of the most beautiful, tender love stories on film.  Don't believe me?  Watch the movie again very carefully.  Watch how Johnny carasses Baby and how he looks at her, not only during the love scenes.  It seemed that he loved her so much it hurt.  The chemistry between the two was so perfect.  I won't even start on the seduction dance, especially the ""penetration"" scene.  I admit this movie sparked a 20 year fantasy of dancing the Mambo with Patrick.  Of course he'd have to teach me first.Its very obvious that a lot of love went into the making of this film and it looked beautiful for such a constrained budget.  I thank the producer for never giving up on the project, for the actors, the dancers and everyone else involved.

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A7N0AAJUWKO4J	"""amyshamrock"""	For a PG-13 film, this has got to be the sexiest film I've seen.  This movie is a typical love story: girl and guy are different &quot;classes&quot;...girl and guy get together anyway...people object, etc. However, this film manages to get, and keep, your attention through several plot twists.  Jennifer Grey stars as &quot;Baby&quot; a spoiled daddy's girl.  Baby goes with her family to a resort for summer vacation.  There, she meets Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), the defiant and seductive dance instructor.  Even though Baby is encouraged to learn &quot;lady-like&quot; dances and crafts, her heart's desire is to be a rebel for once in her life &amp; dance like the staff...dirty dancing.  When Johnny loses his dance partner, Baby takes over...even though she's never danced like that before.  It is obvious that Johnny is not pleased with the arrangement, but decides to endure the torture. During Baby's private dance lessons, the music is great and the chemistry between the two actors is absolutely sizzling!  This is very much a &quot;coming-of-age&quot; film. We get to see several characters grow up and learn life lessons quickly in this movie.  Although this movie appeals to a younger crowd, my best friend's mother is one of the biggest fans I know!!  I was somewhat disappointed with the ending, but overall, this is one of my favorite films of all times.  This is a must see &amp; a &quot;must buy&quot;...you'll want to see it again and again.	5.0	You'll have the time of your life!	2001-06-05	29	28	1

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A312H83BY3MG93	Anastasia	Very good movie, about &#34;real people&#34;, because it shows how person can grow up in one summer more than in whole life before that - Baby realize, nobody cares if you doing your job good and want to do that better, nobody cares about you if you not from good family and dont have money... and even people from &#34;good families&#34; sometimes have bad attitude and dirty secrets. She learn, everything not what it seems....  It will help her in future.  (Her sister seems didnt get any of that benefits, because pay attention only to herself).Of course, Baby also get romantic relationships, which is wasnt necessary... but she will remember that summer whole her life even just because of that. I think, sometimes thats worth it.Gorgeous music, beautiful dancing...One of the best movies ever!	5.0	Classics? Very romantic but also very realistic	2014-04-09	0	0	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2YG33P1ZZBSU	Anonymous	"I saw this movie when it first came out (1987) and loved it.  I have since watched it a zillion times on TV, bought it on videotape, and now decided to add it to my DVD collection.  It's not perfect (nothing is!) but overall I found it very entertaining with likeable characters.The coming of age story set in the early 60's was sweet.  I liked how Baby was intrigued by Johnny from the moment she saw him, whereas his reaction to her was the opposite - he barely noticed her, basically dismissing her as just a frivolous rich girl vacationing with her mommy and daddy (Johnny never made any reference to her sister, Lisa).Johnny was vehemently opposed to Baby filling in when Penny was unable to dance with him at the Sheldrake, but he gave in and reluctantly agreed to teach Baby to dance.  However, as they spent more and more time together, Johnny  gradually came to feel that there was something special about Baby. She had depth to her, something he felt that he lacked.The only thing that disappointed me (being one who wants a concrete happy ending for a movie of this nature) is that the ending seemed to be left open, up to interpretation.Did Baby and Johnny just have a summer fling at Kellermans and then go their separate ways?Or was their impact on each other's lives stronger than that, as the words to the song that Johnny chose personally for their final dance at Kellermans might suggest?  Did they fall in love and have a future together? I'd like to think so!I was left wondering where Johnny was going to take Baby at the very end of the movie when he took her hand and was leading her out the door of the room where the final dance had been -- before they intercepted by her father, whose admission to Johnny that he had been wrong about him (about Johnny having been the one who got Penny ""into trouble"") was rather lame.  Her father could have been more direct about it, especially because he had been very direct and open with his distrust and disdain toward Johnny throughout the movie.All in all, I found this to be a wonderful heart-warming movie."	5.0	I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this movie!	2013-05-28	0	0	0

Some dance moves are a bit much, but for the most part the dancing is great and the story is a classic - girl meets boy, girl falls for boy, but will they end up together in the end?Some of the plot is a bit deep and parents should abide by the PG-13 rating or maybe even a bit older.

I do not understand the hate for it because it si such a lovely piece of work that i dont see how anyone can hate it????????why do people need to make it sound so horrible, i think it is because they want to look clever and they probably havent even seen the movie anyway.Patrick swayze is to die for and jennifer grey just looks so cute in her hotpants and she can really act too!the movie covers so many different topics of every teenagers life that you can really relate to baby, and what she goes through. I cried atthe end when everything was all ok because the movie was so well done and really got into my blood. If you didn't like this its because you didnt get it and you must not understand movies then?????go rent or buy this now as i higly recomend it.	5.0	This film is probably the best ever filmed	2005-09-10	8	2	6

I saw this movie when it first came out and when it is on cable, I watch it all over again even though I have the tape.  It can always cheer me up.  The  dance moves are spectacular.  It truly is a masterpiece in the way it shows  the budding relationship between Johnnie and Baby.  The innocence of the  time allows the relationship to progress at a more leisurely pace than  would happen today.  The sense of position also puts a restraint that most  of us cheer to remove.  We all like to see the underdog win.  Especially  if he looks as great as Patrick Swayse does in this movie.  It is nice to  see the great looking guy falling for the not as great looking girl for a  change.  This movie may not be factually correct as far as the music of  the time it is portraying, but who  cares.  A great movie and one you  finish with a smile on your face and a dance in your step.	5.0	I loved this movie	2000-07-09	0	0	0
0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A1R602SXNGOMJ4	A. Vegan	"This timeless summer love story is a classic and will never be dated. I can't even count how many times I've seen Dirty Dancing. This is one movie that I could probably watch every few weeks and still love.There is something timeless about this movie. I have loved other ""blockbuster love story movies"" like Pretty Woman. I think it's up there but there is something about Dirty Dancing that just makes it absolutely perfect. The characters, the chemistry between Swaze and Grey, the movie's direction, the amazing dancing, the warm summery atmosphere, everything about dirty dancing is absolutely perfect. It is an instant classic and I've never really seen a movie like it either before or since.I don't think there is one particular element that makes this movie so loved but many things, a lot of which are mentioned by numerous reviewers. Dirty Dancing has a nostalgic, languid, summery mood, realistic characters, a relateable honest message coupled with incredible music and dancing, and the one of the best dance sequences cinema has ever given us.This movie is always on TV and I will continue to watch it as long as they show it. But I WILL mention I have no interest in seeing ""Havanna Nights"", this one they should have left alone."	4.0	Dirrrty	2006-02-22	1	0	1

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2MM0XKBIDP138	boleo	Without the dancing this would be a very tiresome movie. There is nothing original or new about the story or the acting. Although the inclusion of Jerry Orbach makes it hard to say that. Patrick Swaze was good but he mainly dances. Jenifer Grey learned a lot from her father,Joel Grey. but there is no real coming together of the characters. The dancing fills in between the story of Baby and the story of the Catskills vacation retreat. The dancing takes over the story and becomes the whole picture. It glows and shimmers and is carried up by the lighting and the romance. It is as though the two dancers are extracted from the mundane script and elevated above the flat story.

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A3QP52KNJK8R40	Bricktop	I give this movie and the DVD package 4 stars. The music was powerful and the love story between Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze was a powerful one and the acting performances by all involved were completely believable.Now for the DVD itself. If you own the Collectors Edition and you're wondering whether or not you would want this version there should be only one thing to take into account....how good is your home theatre system?If you have a 5.1-7.1 home theatre system then I would highly recommend buying this version, the DTS:ES 6.1 discreet audio track is more visceral than the Dolby Digital 5.1EX track and with almost twice the bit rate you're getting nearly twice the information. This means that you're listening to something that's more accurately reproducing the original studio masters of the audio with less compression than the Dolby track.If you already own the collectors edition and you're watching your DVDs through either just your television, a two channel stereo or with a receiver that only supports Dolby Digital or Dolby Pro Logic/Pro Logic II then I would say to be sated with the version you already have. There is not much more that this DVD covers with the interviews and features that, after watching the collectors edition, you would care to see.	4.0	If you own the Collectors, do you want this one?

I had forgotten so much -- the astonishing physicality and focus of Patrick Swayze, the terrific chemistry between him and Jennifer Grey, just how fantastic Jennifer Grey herself is in this movie, and the out-freakin-standing soundtrack. Every.single.song = Perfection. Even though I'm a lady I tend to like movies where stuff blows up (oh, Bruce Willis, be still my heart) so this is one of the very few romantic movies I really enjoy. Better yet and I can go back and watch my fave scenes whenever I want. Happy happy joy joy!	5.0	Such a pleasure to watch!	2012-04-20	2	2	0

It may pose a problem for storage for some. This is easily remedied by tossing the outer packaging and keeping the enclosed reg. size dvd (cardboard) case and extra keepsake book.  As for the content- Enclosed is the blu ray movie plus digital copy, A keepsake hardcover book written by Eleanor Bergstein(writer and coproducer of the movie). A Fifty dollar off coupon for the Mountain Lake Hotel( where most of the movie was filmed).The Bluray looked great on my sony LCD, the audio sounded fantastic on my Onkyo 7.1. I loved the extra features included on the bluray! There was a feature on the filming locations of the movie (Kellarman's Reliving the Locations), Tear jerking tributes to Swayze, Ardolino,Orbach, Behind the scene commentaries, Music videos, cast interviews, etc.  The list goes on and on!The keepsake book- includes bios of the main characters and what they have been up to since filming dirty dancing. Lots of movie photos as well.Overall- I am happy with my purchase. I think for those that already own Dirty Dancing on dvd- this is a must have for the blu ray  picture, audio and extra content."	5.0	Blu ray Keepsake edition review	2010-05-18	2	2	0
0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A3NTNZJXQRN7QE	Bruce P. Barten	Everybody's hero is called 'Baby' in this movie.  People who try to make themselves into heroes by clinging to a system which attempts to demonstrate that it has values like the Kellermans, who are constantly  trying to control the situation here, end up being like &quot;the big  creep&quot; when they have to fire people who have emotional outbursts  about this kind of thing.  Curiously, as I remember this movie, there is a  doctor who says, &quot;When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong.&quot;  This must be  pure fantasy.	5.0	Everybody's Hero	2000-07-10	1	0	1
0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A1VHBZJ4UKPAGF	Bruce S. Bertram	If you haven't seen Dirty Dancing, don't read my review because it contains spoilers.I like this movie, in spite of the stupidity of sex outside marriage by one girl right after another girl almost dies from an abortion.  (Gee, it couldn't happen to me, could it?)  The lead female gets 'exposed' to a lot of immorality, finding her 'true love;' along the way learning to lie, cheat, and steal but still winding up happily ever after?  Typical Hollyweird.The dancing leaves something to be desired also, unless you count sex standing up clothed as dancing.  They do better with some of the standard ballroom stuff, which looks classier and less like hookers advertising on the boulevard.  There are decent resolutions to some of the plot lines, and overall it is an enjoyable if cautionary tale of youth with just enough knowledge to get themselves in real trouble.  The music is pretty decent too.If parents and kids watch it together then at least this fable could be used for teaching lessons such as why passion is not enough on which to build solid relationships or the terror of abortion.The special features of the ultimate edition are very interesting and instructive, except for the slobbering over the gay director who died of AIDS at 50.  I like to watch interviews and 'making of' specials with my kids and grandkids because I want them to know just how much fantasy goes into a film, and there is a great deal in this one.	4.0	Good movie for kid's talk about stupidity	2008-03-28	8	0	8

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	ABH4G7TVI6G2T	Byron Kolln	"DIRTY DANCING is still the ultimate guilty pleasure (runners-up include FLASHDANCE and TOP GUN).  The film shot Patrick Swayze into the realms of super-stardom and spawned two hit albums and a touring concert event.Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Jennifer Grey - BOUNCE, TV's ""Friends"") is vacationing with her parents and older sister at a resort in the Catskills.  There, she meets dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze - GHOST, CITY OF JOY).  The two opposites immediately attract when Johnny's knocked-up dance partner (Cynthia Rhodes) has to get an abortion leaving Johnny to find a replacement - quick.  Baby volunteers, and so begins the glittery, music-filled love story.The film also features Broadway veterans Jerry Orbach and Kelly Bishop as Baby's parents.This new Special Edition DVD includes the full 'Dirty Dancing Live in Concert' which included performances by Merry Clayton and the original dancers from the film.  There is also the trailer, behind-the-scenes footage and a commentary track."	5.0	you'll have the time of your life!	2002-07-15	15	15	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A3M9R165TCYTDT	Campbell Defaoite	"Let me just say, the first reason I give this movie 5 stars is it is just plain FUN! This is an excellent chick flick- without all the Barbie Dollish qualities of modern chick flicks. At Kellerman's Resort, in the Catskills, Frances ""Baby"" Houseman takes a vacation with her family. She sees Penny, a dancer at the hotel in a lot of trouble- Penny is pregnant, and can only get an abortion if she finds a way out of a dance she must do at a neighboring hotel. Baby offers to dance for Penny, so Penny can get the abortion. Baby dances at the hotel with Kellerman's dance instructor, Johnny, and over time, falls in love with Johnny. Baby and Johnny learn a lot from each other, and they realize that together, they can do anything- even stand up for the rights of staff at Kellerman's. I found the dancing scenes enthralling- there was some really nice camerawork filming the progression of Baby's feet as she learns the Mambo. I really thought this was a thoughtful movie, when it discussed mature topics such as abortion, but in the same movie, they fit in loads of fun. The romance was realistic, and Johnny and Baby completely had chemistry with each other. Personally, I loved this movie, but it may not be for everyone. This movie is for people who are not bored stiff by dancing. This is also not for anyone who can't handle a bit of romance or sap, and it is not really a kid's movie. In my opinion, this was an excellent movie!"	5.0	A true classic	2012-11-04	0	0	0

When I did play it on my laptop, only the 2nd DVD would play, the one with all the interviews and information on how they made the movie, etc.  I then went to play the actual movie and it would not play on my laptop.  When I got home that night, I put the DVD in my TV/DVD player.  Sure enough it would not play in that machine either.As of this writing, this issue has not yet been resolved with Amazon.  I have purchased many movies through Amazon and this is the first time I've ever run into a problem like this.  Hopefully my Keepsake edition will be replaced soon and at no cost to me.

Everything about this movie is perfect in that there is no part that you are not sucked into these people's lives!  I absolutely fell in love with it from the first time I watched it in the 1980's.  I have the original VHS still and had to upgrade to DVD as it would not be right not owning a great movie.  I controversies were a great point...pregnancy being such one.  I also enjoy the forbidden love with Swayze and Grey-as they have great online chemistry.  The movie is set in 1963 so the music and clothes are also great to watch.  I like when Baby stumbles upon the ""dirty dancing"" club.  It is great. I like the fact that they don't try and play 1963 as innocent.

I had the soundtrack, I knew every line, I knew the choreography every dance step and swivel and thrust. Jennifer Grey was me, big nose, bad perm and small chest. Patrick Swayze, well he didn't exist in my world, so I had to watch his again and again. We all knew the ""I carried a watermelon"" and ""nobody puts baby in the corner"" but did we really know why we even felt so passionate about it in the first place? The story being set in the late 50's, the setting at a family vacation spot, the outsider looking in, dancing, forbidden love, mystery, it all entered our psyches as THE perfect movie and never lost its footing. Could Patrick Swayzes white t-shirt be any tighter, could Jennifer Grays smirk be any cuter, could Jerry Orbach be a more perfect protective father?  NO! After this came out, I saw advertisements for learning how to ""dirty dance"" and asked my parents, with me being in ballet and jazz, what was one more class? Well it turns out 14 year olds shouldn't be gyrating against each other, who knew? I still learned them, by watching the tape over and over, but my partner was a girl named April and I think we giggled too much. Now that I think about it, if anyone had caught us I would have been straight to therapy. I haven't watched it in years, my husband refuses to even acknowledge its existence ""chick movie"" he mumbles, is it really just a girl phenomena?

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A17N23WXA7EAF	"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter"""	"""Dirty Dancing"" is a deceptive film in many ways. The title alone implies a kind of steamy sexuality that belies what is otherwise an old fashioned story about romance and decency. But ""Dirty Dancing"" is more than just a love story. It is also a classic tale of tribal evolution.Patrick Swayze plays Johnnie a dance instructor at a wealthy retreat in the Catskills during the early sixties. Jennifer Gray plays ""Baby"" a wealthy young vacationer who falls in love with Johnnie. The film is fraught with the usual class differences (Johnnie's set is poor, Baby's is rich) and tragic misunderstandings (Baby's father thinks Johnnie is immoral when if fact he is decent and honest.). This produces that kind of tension that makes the love affair between Johnnie and Baby a little more interesting than--say-- if they sat by the creek all day exchanging vows of passion.The real plot of ""Dirty Dancing"" is that a tribe of people has failed to evolve with the changing times. In order to evolve, the tribe requires a hero to invigorate it with new concepts and a new vision. The tribe in this case is the vacationers (the parents and their young adult children) at the retreat in the Catskills. The hero, of course, is Johnnie.In the final scene of the movie, an older vacationer tells one of the servants that the retreat has lost much of its vigor and that the children prefer vacations in Europe to spending the summer with their parents in the Catskills (Gee, what a surprise!). He delivers his monologue as the children perform an obsolete, dull, and out-of-tune musical skit before the assembled vacationers. At that moment, Johnnie who has hitherto been banished from the tribe makes a surprise entrance. He snatches Baby from the protective grip of her family, brings her to the stage and invigorates the tepid assembly with an amazing dance routine. As the crowd woops and cheers to Johnnie and Baby's antics, the old man who previously lamented the tribe's lack of enthusiasm realizes that Johnny's style and performance is the answer. Johnnie speaks to the younger generation with a new idea and a new style. In doing so, he motivates them to remain with the tribe (that is to take boring vacations with their parents instead of going to Venice for the summer). In claiming his woman and reinstating himself in the tribe he also initiates a vital fertility rite. Love, justice, and rock and role pull the Catskill vacationers out of the doldrums and help push them into a new era (of yet more dull vacations in the Catskills)."	5.0	Dirty Tribal Reunification	2001-04-11	3	2	1

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A1L1NJNVL5ICZB	"Cloudburst2000 ""OasisRocks"""	Dirty Dancing was one of those movies that defined 80's cinema.  It was a 'sleeper' hit.  It didn't get much promotion from the studio.  It's promotion came from word of mouth.  People saw the movie, loved it, and told their friends to see it.  This movie made such an impact that it caused people to attend dancing lessons in droves, spawned to best-selling sound tracks, spawned a short-lived TV show, and spawned a Broadway musical.  Dirty Dancing still has an extremely loyal following which coused the studio to release a rehash of the plot a couple years ago called Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights.  The original movie is much better both in storyline and acting.  Don't let the rehash of the plot dissuade you from seeing the original.  You won't be disappointed.Dirty Dancing is a wonderful coming-of-age story.  Baby(Jennifer Grey) is vacationing in the Catskills with her family the summer before she starts college.  She soon meets Johnny Castle(Patrick Swayze) who is the dance instructor at the resort they are staying at.  After a somewhat rocky start, she and Johnny begin an illicit love affair.  They are both risking alot by being together.  Johnny is risking his job, and Baby is risking losing the respect of her father who has trouble seeing that being poorer doesn't necessarily mean being less worthy.  This movie has a wonderful climax that will make you smile every time.  It will make you feel as Johnny put it that 'there are people willing to stand up for you no matter what it costs them.'  Just a great movie with some wonderful messages throughout.I also enjoyed the extras that were available on this DVD.  Some of the extras included were an interesting interview with Jennifer Grey and a video of her try-out for the movie.  I enjoyed the extras, but they are probably only something mega-fans would ever watch.And to the person below who gave Dirty Dancing one star because it was a 'rip-off' of Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights and even 'stole' the title.  Hun, Dirty Dancing came out almost 20 years ago.  Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights came out like 2 years ago.  Dirty Dancing was the original...and better movie.  Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights was supposed to be a 'remake' of the original movie only set in Cuba instead of the Catskills.  So it would be the 'rip-off' not the original *rolls eyes*	5.0	One of the best 80's movies	2005-12-29	2	2	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2Z00WAKUJHJ1M	Daniel Haskett	Although entitled to opinion, common opinion calls the 80's the golden age of movies and Dirty Dancing is one of the quintessential pieces to the puzzle.Jennifer Grey staring as Frances &#34;Baby&#34; Houseman, is your typical overly sheltered rich girl.Patrick Swayze staring as handsome dance instructor Johnny Castle, is your typical stick it to the man city boy.Upon meeting each other, their true personalities are free to come out, and in the end Baby is a lot more understanding of less privileged than once lead on, and Johnny is a lot deeper, caring, and genuine then he first leads on.Baby and Johnny immediately develop feelings for each other, but it isn't until Baby goes out on a limb for Johnny that the trust is built between them in order for them to fall in love.Upon falling in love, Johnny and Baby share one last dance together so meaningful that they can envision a future together, and so powerful that Baby's father (once hesitant towards Johnny) now accepts and embraces him as Baby's lover.Watched this movie in Prime Instant Video and was happy with the quality as well.I will definitely buy this movie and add it to my vast collection, and if you enjoy it as much as I did you should too.	5.0	80's Classic	2014-05-14	0	0	0
0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A3OZU2EMJQ5FIC	danielle levin	This movie has touched me so much it's great. The movie is about a a young girl who is a little daddy girl and does everything she is told until she met her love Johnny (Patrick Swayze). Baby (Jennifer Grey) learns not only how to dance and stick up for herself but she learns how to love someone and show everyone what she's got. If you want a great chick flick this si the one. Its a movie that will never be forgotton. Grey dances great in the movie and so does Swayze. Cythnia Rodes who plays Penny is a wonderful dancer as will.

Patrick Swayze is sexier than he has ever been and will be, Jennifer Grey is wonderfully casted for the warm, strong willed, charming but not a classical beauty Baby. The leading woman character Baby (real name Frances) is so admirable-she is optimistic, confident, helpful, intellectuel and is not afraid to go for what she wants without being egoistic. I have to admit that I took her as a role model at that time. Today watching it again when I am 30, I still think that I can adopt some characteristics of her-at least believe that I can change stgs if not the whole world	4.0	looking back at my highschool years	2003-10-28	2	2	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A1GQ9DQTL0EZ7D	"D. Flagg ""Classic Lover"""	I am a fan of movies, all kinds and all eras.  Dirty Dancing is a movie I saw on television so often that it almost seem to disappear while you were looking at it.  I'd never seen it in the movie theater and I don't know that it mattered to me before I bought this DVD.  However, I have a nice, large flat screen TV (like most of the USA) and when I played this DVD I was surprised and delighted.  It was enchanting.  The nostalgia was like visiting your past without the angst and acne.  It felt good.  I like a movie that makes me feel good.  This is one of those films.  Jennifer Gray is sweet and believable and Patrick Swayze is amazing to watch.  Except for some of the obvious dialog and a naive plot line I loved it.  Don't knock a naive plot line - it's sweet if it's in this movie.	4.0	Dirty Dancing	2011-03-11	0	0	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2NJD23OA3771K	DJ OHM-DOG	I had been putting this movie off for years.  It actually wasn't until a half hour ago in 11/10 that I watched the movie completely.  First off.  This VHS has no special features from what I know.  It's just the movie.  Second off this is another movie that I thought was one of those Teen movies that all the jocks watch and can relate to.  I also thought of this with Sixteen Candles.  The truth to this movie is that it is very realistic (NOT HISTORICALLY ACCURATE).  That everyone reacted the way someone in our real world would.  Assumptions, associations, and generalizing.  This movie has a great message in it, that I believe is great for teens to hear.  There is confrontations in it and there is only one quick fight scene.  I kid you not.  I mean there has to be a reason why Kevin Smith would spoof this movie for his CLERKS CARTOONS (Clerks - The Animated Series Uncensored).  I was blown away.  If anything in my opinion it works with the bridge between daughters growing and becoming women with the segregation that come from their parents and they deal with it and move on.-Thanks!!!	5.0	Worth it!!!	2010-11-30	0	0	0

I don't get why the stars are not listed in the Amazon info, though, and why the older, 2000 dvd is labeled blu-ray.I was right outa college in 1963, and summered in a similar place. The spirit and sound of the film are period perfect.  Swayze and Grey are a perfect film couple; they are sympathetic characters with great chemistry.  The standard Hollywood conventions and devices mount up by the end, spoiling the ""willing suspension of disbelief"".  For a while, though, you can forget this is a Hollywood movie.  Regardless of its increasing implausibility as the film barrels along, I still felt tears well up at the finale."	4.0	No one puts baby in a corner	2008-07-05	6	6	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2W1O4Y2LDH4YW	"""donna49"""	"I may be 54 now but Patrick Swayze can still get my blood boiling hot and rushing madly through my old vascular system anytime! I have seen this movie at least 100 times. I know every line for every character, every action before it occurs --- yet I never grow tired of watching the movie nor listening to the music. I think I wore out my original music cassettes --- I played them over and over, for years. It brings back memories of gentler times...less complicated times...shortly before our innocence was violently stripped away forever.Until reading the reviews online, I didn't realize that my passion for this movie was shared by so many others. Many times in the past, I was embarrassed to admit my longtime ""love affair"" with ""Dirty Dancing"" --- it seemed almost juvenile, as if I hadn't ""grown up"" yet emotionally. The music and dancing are timeless...sensual, romantic, perfect foreplay...they can bring me out of the bluest blues instantly, or set sparks of love glowing inside quicker than anything else legally available. ;)Although ""Dirty Dancing"" may never be considered a classic like ""Gone With the Wind,"" it's a definite must-see for every generation. Since I came of age in the 1960's, this movie will always be part of my growing-up years...despite the fact that I was about 37 or so when it first hit the wide screen. :)  As for the music, there is no competition in my heart.Definitely 5 stars...DVD belongs in every movie and music lovers' collections, as well as in ""time capsules"" for future generations.  ;)My only comment is that Jennifer Grey looked so much better before the plastic surgery on her nose. Her old nose gave her more character, more appeal...she'll never resemble ""Baby"" with that ""new and improved"" model."	5.0	Patrick Swayze can turn me on anytime.....	2003-12-26	8	8	0

She falls in love with him (Swayze)  Jerry Orbach is her father, he is also a doctor.  That also plays into the movie.  It is one movie that has a lot of nostalgia.  Not for the young kids.

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A84Z6XUMGRMJ1	Duane Thomas	"In the summer of 1963 we meet Francis Houseman (Jennifer Grey), a shy, bookish, virginal, idealistic young woman, and the apple of her doctor daddy's eye. She's the sort of girl, even in her late teens, everyone still calls ""Baby"" and it doesn't bother her. Baby travels with her family to a spendy resort hotel in the Catskills for three weeks vacation that, though she knows it not, will change her life forever. There she meets dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). It's a classic mismatch. He's a tough, talented kid from Phillie who's led a hardscrabble life. She's, well, Baby.It's immense attraction at first sight, for her at least. He by contrast thinks she must be a typical worthless rich girl. Johnny and his fellow instructor/ex-girlfriend/surrogate sister Penny spend their days teaching sedate, boring dances to sedate, boring people, and in the nights blow it off at parties in the staff quarters with loud, hard driving music and the sort of sinuous, close, steamy, erotic, go for broke dancing they're really capable of. The staff quarters and parties are, of course, strictly off limits to guests - until Baby wanders in one starcrossed night.Through circumstances quite believable, Baby winds up having to sub for Penny at one of her and Johnny's gigs. This is important, no one else can do it, innocent people will truly suffer if Baby doesn't save the day, and with a heart as big as all outdoors she can't let that happen. Besides, it means she gets to spend time with Johnny. Problem: she's naturally awkward - or so she thinks - and doesn't know how to dance at all. In the best scenes in the film, Johnny has to teach her to dance, and these two very different people, from two different worlds, begin to fall in love.This is a wonderful love story, a comedy, a drama, and a musical, all rolled into one. The dance numbers are a metaphor for Baby's coming of age, her awakening sexuality, as a good girl turns into a good woman. All Baby and Johnny's dancing is done by the actors, there are no doubles. Patrick Swayze was already an experienced professional dancer, appearing among other things as Danny in Grease on Broadway. Jennifer, though she'd taken dance classes as a child, had never performed before anyone except the other kids in dance class years before - until Dirty Dancing required her to do it in front of 100 cast and crew and 350 extras.The DVD looks great, the quality of audio and visual transfer high, the soundtrack crisp and clear, the colors vibrant. This is all-important in a movie relying so much for its success on color and movement and a great soundtrack. Speaking of which, Dirty Dancing has the soundtrack from Hell. 14 preexisting old songs were used in the film, and another seven, maintaining the early 60s sound extraordinarily well, were written especially for it. The soundtrack sold one million copies in its first five weeks of release, rocketing to Billboard's number one slot above Michael Jackson's Thriller. Eventually two soundtracks were released, selling over 20 million units combined, and becoming the first time in history two soundtracks from the same movie both cracked the Top Ten.Dirty Dancing was made on a shoestring budget of 5.2 million, which would just about pay for the catering on ""bigger"" films not possessing one hundredth of its gentle sentimentality, style and energy. It grossed 170 million dollars worldwide. Just goes to prove you don't need a huge budget when a movie has a great script and direction, excellent choreography, talented and enthusiastic performers, and that quality difficult to define but impossible to mistake or ignore: heart."	5.0	A Great Romantic Musical Gets Top Drawer DVD Treatment	2004-03-24	5	5	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A1IZ7X1TUW93PG	Elizabeth	This movie is a classic film! I am not putting it in the same class as Citizen Kane or Gone With the Wind, a different kind of classic. If that makes any sense.I love the great quotes like, &#34;I carried a watermelon....&#34; or &#34;Nobody puts Baby in the corner....&#34;; those two are my favorite. They are iconic to my sister and myself. Its how Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze say them as well... their tone and acting quirkes really add to this film.This film has a WONDERFUL soundtrack as well. Perfect music for each scene... kind of makes you want to dance as well!	5.0	A Classic!	2013-03-18	0	0	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	AT80B1UWE8HBF	Elka Weber	The 80's. What a wonderful decade for some of us and more over  having a film like &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; to bring back memories of a time full of dreams, expectations, doubts and findings. The story of Frances &quot;Baby&quot; Hausmann and handsom Johnny Castle made me believe in true love, the kind of love that makes you dream, believe, be happy, feel the world in the palm of your hand and, eventhough it elapsed in the 60's, &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; love story was as true in the 80's as it is now. And no good movie can be complete without a good soundtrack interlacing images and music. This is absolutely clear when you think about songs like &quot;Hungry Eyes&quot; by Eric Carmen, &quot;Cry To Me&quot; by Solomon Burke, such a wonderful love song as &quot;She's Like the Wind&quot; so breathtakingly performed by Patrick Swayze and last, but no less alive in my mind, &quot;I've had the time of My Life&quot;, a premium closing song for a movie that deserves to be called &quot;A Landmark of the 80's.

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	AW003H7Z3OCHA	forrie	As the movie opens Baby (Grey) provides a background introduction of the world in 1963 before the &quot;BEATLES&quot;, before the assassination of John F. Kennedy and her last summer of innocence.  Off to college, save the world and joining the Peace Corps.This is her last traditional family summer vacation in the Catskills of New york at the &quot;KELLERMAN's family resort.With this set, we now fall into the classic story of dance (brilliantly performed by Swayze, Rhodes &amp; Grey), music (one of the best movie sound tracks of the 80's) &amp; chemistry (Swayze &amp; Grey have all the magic needed to pull this off).Dirty Dancing is a movie phenomenon.  This movie works because you feel all the ingredients of a great story unveiling before your senses.  Don't analyze it.  Just enjoy the ride over and over.

It is supposed to look'60s but it looks more '80s and they never had the song &quot;I've Had the Time Of My Life&quot; back in the '60s.

Yes there is some immature dialogue here and there and all turns out right in the end for the characters played by Swayze and Grey.  However, it shows how love and affection can conquer all angles.  It also shows the strengths and weakensses in both Swayze and Grey and Jerry Orbach for that matter.  The Dance scenes are pretty captivating for the particular genre.  Maybe not the most well developed story in the world but for a night when something relatively light will do, this flick will certainly fit the bill.	4.0	It Has Some Charm	2001-01-06	0	0	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A3IE4AA32FJ1U5	"""goodgrief25"""	I'm assuming that if you are looking to buy this title on DVD, you have seen it before or at least been told a lot about the movie...  So, I'm not going to write about the story or anything like that.  This is geared more  towards a movie collector.The description on Amazon.com and the box  itself indicates that this is just a great DVD for collectors.  It has tons  of extra features (which I know we all go for)  Some of the features listed  are featurettes, music videos, commentaries and the like.  It, of course  has all these, and more.However, Artisan apparently wanted to boost  sales by printing a new DVD collector's title but didn't want to put the  money into it.  ALL of the special features are of VERY poor video quality  (most looking like they were encoded from a VHS tape) and the audio quality  on these extras isn't much better.  Very disappointing to say the  least!To top it off, the movie itself is of less than good quality.  Especially seeing that this film was &quot;remastered&quot; and rereleased  a year or so ago!  The video quality is better than VHS, but no better than  SVHS and it seemed to me that the contrast of the transfer was way to high.  Things are blurry when they shouldn't be and the transfer, at times looks  digitized (LOW bit rate to save space! )The only decent things about  this disc are the movie itself (I suppose I would still rather own this DVD  copy than a VHS copy) and the AUDIO for the film sounds pretty good - not  great, but pretty good.Basically, what I am saying is that if you really  like this movie and are a DVD person like myself, buy it - but don't expect  to be awed by the presentation!	2.0	Down on Dirty Dancing DVD	2000-05-07	11	7	4

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A1CUKBFI3P78KP	"Graham Johnson ""tektrader"""	I had high hopes for this Bluray as I love this movie. I figured a new AVC transfer would bring this disk back to life after suffering the SD DVD bad transferrs I already have.It was not to be. The movie is soft and washed out. There has been a large amount of electronic grain reduction undertaken that has bascially destroyed the PQ by sofetning the entire image and crushing the blacks in some scenes to the point where the picture look posterized.While still better than a DVD it is a disaster. Lionsgate should chastised for failing to use this bluray as an opportunity to present this movie as it should have been.If you take a look at the deleted scenes, you will see how good the transfer could have been. These are much better than the movie itself as the intense video processing to remove grain hasnt been done.Liongate, You wrecked this movie and are now on my watch list for future transfers which I have to investigate closely before spending my money on your product. You should be ashamed.On an up side note. The Audio quality is excellent with the PCM sound track.It worked first time in my Samsung 1200 Bluray player.	2.0	How NOT to master a bluray	2007-08-23	57	50	7

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A3PWF2AQ5XYALW	G. Reid	"This movie has a formula summer romance and great sexy dancing. Dirty dancing means close sexy dancing with wonderful dancing music. Seven new songs were written specifically for the movie. Jimmy Lenner, the executive producer of the soundtrack, wanted to make sure that the new songs had their emotional roots in the early sixties. To him, this was imperative in making the music blend seamlessly into the film. The new songs needed to be as immediate and poignant in 1987 as they would have been in 1963. The new songs included ""The Time Of My Life"", ""Hungry Eyes"", ""You Don't Own Me"", ""Where Are You Tonight"", and ""She's Like The Wind."""	5.0	Great Music & Dancing	2005-03-28	3	1	2

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2B4MA73Z6UTA9	Heather	Dirty Dancing is one of my all time favorite movies. The movie is about a bad boy named Johnny that is a dance instrucot at a resort. His dance parter, Penny, is pregnant and won't be able to perform their mombo act at another motel. There is a customer at the resort, named Baby, that is willing to learn the dance. While Johnny is teaching Baby the dance they fall in love. The night of the performance goes fairly well but while they are gone Penny gets into trouble. Baby goes and gets her father to help because he is a doctor. He helps Penny, but he told Baby to stay away from Johnny and Penny. Baby does not listen. Her and Johnny sneak around so that no one finds out about them. One day Johnny gets mad because Baby won't tell her father about them. Johnny is accused of stealing and Baby then sticks up for him so he won't be fired. He is fired anyways. Baby's dad gets really mad because she didn't listen to him. There is a show to end the season that Johnny was supposed to dance for. Instead the whole staff sings a song. Johnny then shows up and says te best line of the movie, &quot;No one puts Baby in a corner.&quot; They then go and perform a dance and her dad realizes that he is not such a bad guy after all. He apologizes and tells Baby how wonderful she looked. I liked this movie because it is a love story. The dancing and music also adds a lot to it. Once you watch this movie you will fall in love with it.	5.0	Favorite all time movie	2001-09-20	4	2	2

If you're anything like me(a hopeless romantic)you'll never be the same again!I've had it on video for ten years and watch it as often as I can.  I used to dance all throughout my childhood (tap, ballet, jazz, etc), but as soon as I saw this movie when I was 15, I switched to Latin-American dancing and it's been my profession ever since.The music and the love displayed in this movie really makes you want to get up and express yourself through dance. Patrick Swayze is a joy to watch.  Throughout my entire career I have never seen a man dance as well as him. Any woman or girl who hasn't seen this movie will fall in love with it instantly, but I also believe it is good for men to see this movie to get a taste of what women really want -not just a hunky guy, but a man who can show his true feelings.	5.0	See this movie!	2003-02-17	0	0	0

The 20th Anniversay edition of ""Diry Dancing"" is definitely a hit. The picture and sound quality are simply outstanding! On my 46-inch high definition TV with my Toshiba 1080p HD DVD--the picture and sound are stunning! The picture is crystal clear and sharp and the colors are rich and vibrant. This movie did not look this good in theaters in 1987, when it was first released. The picture has been enhanced for large, wide screen TVs--so there are no annoying black zones (bars) on the top or the sides of the screen. It fills the whole screen. I still cannot believe that this is a regular DVD, not a high definition edition. It looks and sounds as good as my HD DVDs."	5.0	Superb transfer to DVD--20th Anniversary Edition	2008-04-25	3	2	1

This movie, has had my heart since I saw it as a small girl on tv. I bought the movie and I wore it out, kind of. I then decided to buy the DVD and WOW! I was so surprised by how much better it made the film. The film is about Baby and Johnny and how they meet and fall in love in Baby's &quot;last summer&quot; as an adolescent. They fall in love obviously and there are so many aspects about this movie that are just wonderful and lovable. Every character is lovable in their own way! I love Patrick Swayze in this role, he is very sexy and just so dangerous. You know your typical bad boy persona, but you know bad boys, he really isn't, he is a sweet lovable boy in the body of a bad boy. As for Baby, well she is so innocent and child-like that all you wanna do is just hug her! As for Baby's father, i must say some parts of the movie, I just wanted to kick him, but he is a father, and you know dad's. Well, that's about it, it's a great movie!! It's just so hard to explain the effect! Good Luck!	5.0	Love in the Music	2002-10-29	2	2	0
0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	"The recent decease of this singular star made me rethink about a missed quality in most of actors: the naturalness. In this sense I would have to cite three names of different generations: John Cussack, Robert Mitchum and Montgomery Clift.The charisma he breathed plus his abilities as dancer and that gentle charm became him a true icon since the eighties and nineties.Dirty dancing's plot has been retold many times before. But the visible sensuality produced by this movie and the return to the Disco thanks to film such as  ""Saturday night fever"", ""Grease"", Footlose"" and ""Flash dance"", launched it to the immortality.If heaven exists, I guess God must have said him: WELCOME AT LAST.In memoriam!"	5.0	Patrick Schwayze (1952-FOREVER)	2009-09-22	1	1	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A35XFZN4MWNKK4	ianphillips@uk.dreamcast.com	...Dirty Dancing still stands incredibly well proving the point critics made about the film at the time of its release about it being a timeless classic! Dirty Dancing is simply the ultimate feel-good movie. The chemistry between Patrick Swayze (then relativley unknown) and Jennifer Grey (who has not starred in any major production since) is positivley electric and never strikes a false note. Its a charming story of a young, innocent teenager staying with her family at a holiday camp for her vacation who meets the exciting and rebelious dancer, Johnny who she immediatley falls in love with. They show each other a different side to life and soon become lovers. But as with all good love stories there are complications. Giving superb backing support is Cynthia Rhodes in a small but highly effective role as Penny Johnson who is forced into having an abortion and in the process must give up dancing whilst she recovers - enter Jennifer Grey. There are many fun and amusing scenes of Swayze frantically trying to teach Grey all the right dance moves whilst the touching romance between them gradually and beleavably builds. The ending is a triumphant high! What truly makes Dirty Dancing absolutley unmissable is the fabulous dancing which is highly erotic though never once tacky and is accompanied by a sizzling soundtrack that helps build the potential atmosphere. Superb throughout, Dirty Dancing is indeed a timeless classic!	5.0	Still superb!	2002-12-16	21	21	0

This movie could only be enjoyed by a pack of prepublescent girls at a slumber party who are wondering what its like to lose their virginity. And am I the only one who thinks that Jennifer Gray is a total dog? Sure she's got a hot body but that face! UGGG!

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2CEX7784M8YSU	Jeffery Bauman	When I first saw Dirty Dancing, I liked it, but I thought it wasn't great. I waited a while to see it again, and I wound up loving it. I guess Dirty Dancing is one of those films that really grows on you. The plot isn't anything much, but it's the music and the dancing that really make the movie. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray, while not really great actors, their chemistry here is undeniable. In fact, this is possibly the best performance that Jennifer Grey has ever given in a movie. Above all, I really recommend this movie to anyone who believes in true love, or loves to dance!The film takes place in the summer of 1963 at a Jewish family resort in the Catskills. Francis &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman (Jennifer Grey) is a young girl who wants to change the world. One night, Baby sneaks into a staff party and finds that the staff dances anything but the family fox trot. This where she meets Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze.) When Johnny's ex-girlfriend Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) gets pregnant and wants an abortion (illegal in those days) Baby is asked to dance with Johnny at a contest. This is where the real chemistry begins. But when Baby's father Jake (Jerry Orbach) finds out about the abortion, he tells Baby not to hang around with Johnny. But Baby doesn't listen listen, and soon finds the love of her life. Throughout the movie Baby learns that you can't change the world alone, and she finds her true love, while Johnny finds out about the kind of person he wants to be.Overall Grade: A (10++)	5.0	Dirty Dancing	2001-07-23	14	13	1

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A3KY68OTSNHM3G	Jeffrey T. Munson	This movie is still fun to watch even though it's been out for fifteen years.  Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey are excellent in the lead roles of Johnny and Baby, and Jerry Orbach does a terrific job as Baby's father, Mr. Houseman.The basic plot to the movie revolves around Baby and Johnny.  Baby and her family are on vacation at Kellerman's lodge.  It is here that she meets Johnny Castle, the smooth lodge dance instructor.  Although Baby has been brought up in a prim and proper manner, she is intrigued by the rough-looking Castle.  Soon, Baby is spending all of her free time with Johnny learning about him and his life.  The two become closer, and eventually a strong bond forms between them, much to the chagrin of her father.The atmosphere of the 60's is evident throughout the film.  The clothes and music are sure indicators as are the innocent games of croquet, volleyball, and charades offered by Kellerman's.  Many references are also made to events of the 60's, such as the JFK assassination and Baby's desire to join the Peace Corps.The best part of this movie is the music.  Several hits were spawned from the excellent soundtrack, and I always think back to the movie when I hear them on the radio.  The acting is excellent as well.  Swayze, Grey, Orbach, et. al. do a first rate job throughout the movie.  This movie has become and will remain a classic for many years to come.  Watch it and experience its magic.	4.0	Still Good After All These Years	2003-02-06	0	0	0

Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey have a chemistry you don't see often in movies. Baby (Grey) is a teenage daddy's girl that falls for tough guy dance instructor Johnny (Swayze). This movie has great themes and also one of the best soundtracks.

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A3LSUMACIY0KS4	Jessica	Since this movie first came out to now, 2001, it's been my favorite of all time!  Baby and Johnny represent the classic love story:  girl who starts out as innocent/shy type meets jerky boy who ends up showing his sensitive side and they fall head over heals for each other.  All the while, Baby has to learn how to dance to help out Johnny's partner. The best scene in the whole movie is at the very end when Johnny comes back to have the last dance of the season with Baby as his partner. Those two weeks were part of a summer that changed both their lives forever.  Quotable Quote:  &quot;Nobody puts Baby in a corner.&quot;	5.0	You MUST see this	2001-04-24	1	1	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	AVMYCMAOY4F4S	Joan C. Frank	"When I watched this again recently, it dawned on me that in 2003 I was looking back on 1987 looking back on the early 60s.  In a surreal way, it is sappy, naively sexy, heart warming and complexly nostaligic.I think that Jennifer Grey is stunning, as I did in 1987.  It is surprising to me that she didn't reach greater heights as a movie star.  Patrick Swayze is at his peak of sexiness here, although I clearly remember being more impressed by his sensuality in 1987.  The dancing is entertaining, but contrived.  (I can almost hear the director scream ""action!"" at the beginning of each dance scene.)Even without the fun of the retrospective angle, this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  It has a moral.  It gives a glipse of a different era and a different social scene.  The good guys win.  Boy gets girl - at least momentarily.  Mom and Pop are happy with the resolution.My recommendation:  see this movie once a decade so that you can look back on looking back on looking back.  That's my plan."	5.0	great 80's melodrama	2003-07-16	1	1	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	"A film by Emile ArdolinoThis is perhaps the one movie that I never expected to ever watch.  Nothing that I had heard about it made it sound like something I would have any interest in whatsoever.  I had even less of an expectation that should I actually see the movie that I would actually like it.  When I finally started watching ""Dirty Dancing"", it was to my great surprise when I found that I was enjoying the movie.  Simply put: this is a good movie.It is the summer of 1963.  President Kennedy was still alive and there was still an attitude of innocence in America, at least this is what is presented to us in the film.  Baby (Jennifer Grey) is on vacation for three weeks with her sister and parents (Jerry Orbach, Kelly Bishop) to a resort in the Catskill Mountains.  Baby is nave about the world and about how she relates to the world.  At the resort she meets Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), a kind of bad boy who works with the entertainment crew at the resort.  He is one of the lead dancers at the resort.  They meet and Johnny is not initially impressed with Baby (nor is anyone in the entertainment crew), but when Johnny's dance partner needs to get an abortion, Johnny needs a new dance partner so that he can perform and keep his job.  The new dance partner: Baby.  From this springs good dancing (both in the lessons as well in the performance) and a budding relationship between Johnny and Baby.While I had thought the idea for this movie was a little cheesy, it was perfectly executed.  Good dancing, good music, good acting, good chemistry between Grey and Swayze, and a nice love story.  This movie far exceeded my expectations, and I am glad that I finally watched it (with thanks to my fianc&eacute; for telling me to watch it).  It is a good movie and it still holds up fifteen years after it was first released."	4.0	I'm glad i finally watched this one!	2004-02-24	2	2	0

I had not seen ""Dirty Dancing"" in several years, but my wife had to have this comprehensive addition. It turns out to be fun to watch. Not just the film, but all the extras as well. It is also sad to think that at least five of the talented people who worked on the film are no longer with us - from director, Amele Ardolino to the incomparable Jerry Orbach. And then there is Patrick Swazee. I never truly appreciated him, but have developed a respect for his talents, both as an actor and as a  dancer. ""Dirty Dancing"" is a rollicking, coming of age film, in which Jennifer Gray is perfectly cast as ""Baby."" We see the arc of her character, first as the tentative ""daddy's girl,"" and finally as the free-thinking woman she has become. And all with her original nose."	4.0	Good film holds up over time.	2012-10-26	0	0	0

It is a great film to see for anyone who wants to write their own script or yearns to turn their own novel or life story into a movie. Nostalgic look at coming of age through a summer experience of awe. Jennifer Grey is hauntingly warm and amazingly open in her performance. Patrick Swayze remains eternally sexy. Dance is simply a vehicle for showing passion and expression especially in a generation gap world like the surroundings of where they work in the Poconos. This film has a heartbeat that just keeps on going -- kind of like the Energizer bunny-- you can watch it at different phases of your life and find that it reminds you of something in the past yet at the same time hints at the potential for your future even if you can't waltz or Foxtrot your way to the same spotlight they chose.	5.0	Dancing Your Way to Independent Film Spotlight....	2006-08-04	2	2	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A1MMVPXI5B8AGQ	"Karla Valentine ""veggigoddess2"""	Not sure why none of the reviews are actually for the Ultimate version? They all seem to be for the basic Dirty Dancing no frills dvd versions. Anyhow, my review is for what's actually in the title here which is Dirty Dancing Ultimate Edition. Unfortunately this versin is frilless as the extra cd you get is filled w/ useless crap that is of total uninterest. You get footage of Jennifer Grey's screen test which while neat to see for a coupel min...It goes on forever and gets real boring very fast. I'd rather had seen Patricks, but that's not even an option. Then there are a few interviews one beign JG and the other are behidn the scenes people along w/ oen other actress in the film and they go on and on for so long that I lost interest after 15 min or so. Other then that the rest is simply the trailer for the film, a coupel music videos and that's it! I wanted out takes, interviews w/ Patrick as well as Jen and his screen tests etc... Not all this filler crap that's of zero entertainment value. Love this film as I have seen it well into the 100's at this point counting the numerous times I saw it when it came out in theaters. Don't pay extra for the Ultimate edition. Luckily I got mine for cheaper then if just buying the regular version off ebay so I wasted no money.	2.0	Ultimate edition sucks!

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A1IHQVXSWD0HHS	Kathie Klein	I have always LOVED this movie, spactacular for all the reasons everyone else enjoys it. But this DVD edition has odd menu music that I found distracting. The interviews, though updated from the collector's editon (which was better), were long-winded and unfocused. I found myself wondering when they were going to finish their point. There is a tribute to the director Emile Ardolino who died from AIDS in 1993. It was a nice idea with some good photos of him. But again the interviews were a little long. It seemed like they needed to do a bit more editing. They have also changed the original chapter selection scene titles for each scene. I thought that was unnecessary because the collector's edition version was just fine. Also, perhaps the most obvious missing piece was a missing interview with Patrick Swayze among all the updated interviews. I was disappointed with that.	3.0	GREAT MOVIE But A New Lackluster Edition	2004-05-16	4	3	1

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A1N2L9A6I686G5	"Katie ""book worm"""	"""Dirty Dancing"" is an awesome romance movie set in the late 1950's.  Everything takes place at an upper-class, family-friendly summer camp - where ""rich"" families come to be entertained for a few months.One of the first things I noticed was the great dichotomy between the ""workers"" & the ""guests"", as well as between the ""dancers"" and the rest of the staff.  The dancers are considered ""low lifes"", and as ""less than"" everyone else - as they generally come from poorer homes.  The rest of the staff tends to be kids who plan to go on to well-known colleges & universities - and because of this, many of the families want their girls to become interested in (and hopefully at some point marry) the boys who are ANYTHING but dancers.The premise of the movie is that one of these ""rich girls"" (Baby, played by Jennifer Grey) falls in love with the ""head"" dancer (Johnny, played by Patrick Swayze), and an amazing love affair ensues.  During this ""love affair"", several things happen that make the girls' father think even worse of the man Baby's come to love, and so she's forbidden to see or talk to him again.Several important life-themes come up in this movie, including: the concept of social class & how this can make us blind to truth, the realization that what you see is not always what you get (you can't judge a book by its cover), the fact that we can all do whatever we put our minds to, and that the only constant in life is that things will change.Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good romance - it's one that can pull you in easily, and keep you hooked all the way to the end!"	5.0	One of My All-Time Favorite Movies!	2005-10-22	16	13	3

As excellent as the entire ensemble cast is in this film, Patrick Swayze truly shines in his dancing and acting talent.  His combination of excitement, energy and consummate grace of movement is something magical - something rare in films.  Unfortunately, Patrick Swayze decided he would rather make 'action' films, rather than look as though he was 'cashing in' on his Dirty Dancing accolades.  It is obvious to this viewer that Patrick Swayze should have picked up where Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire left off and gone on to make more dance-oriented films, including stage performances...I hope that it isn't too late for him (along with his beautiful wife) to do that!Of course, I should say something about the lovely Jennifer Grey, as well as the rest of the cast, but Patrick's star just shines so brightly in this film.  It is my fervent hope that he decides in the near future to make another dance film.  Thank you, though, for Dirty Dancing!  It is truly a classic!	4.0	Patrick Swayze is awesome!	2000-10-22	7	6	1

Do I think it's a great movie?  No.  But can I understand why ageneration that grew up with it cherish it? Absolutely.	4.0	Good natured, good hearted 80s mini classic	2011-03-27	0	0	0

She shows him how willing to be loving and supporting and just plain good she is... He eventually becomes a better person for it... Daddy has to be a good man who simply needs to see that he's not giving Johnny the chance he deserves... great Catskills resort setting, 1963... as seen from the 80's, when we have forgotten that a black couple would not be allowed to dance like that together with white folks in the early 60s.Patrick Swayze made the part of Johnny better than it was written. Jennifer Gray is quite a dancer, something I hadn't realized when I saw her in Red Dawn (Patrick Swayze was in that one, too). I love Jerry Ohrbach, and, like Swayze, he made his character better than the writing did. Kelly Bishop was definitely underutilized, they had a wonderful actress (and professional dancer) and gave her nothing to do...Well, you shouldn't probably be sharing it with your 12 year old, but its very good and a little campy and I didn't waste my time watching it..."	4.0	Great romantic schlock, only watch it if you love the genre...	2013-05-19	0	0	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	ANBWCEE5E3UB6	Kitten James	I first saw bits and pieces of the movie but i fell in love with the movie.  Then i could not figure out what the movie was called.  So i spent about 6 months trying to figure out what it was called.  So i finally figured it out and i went out and bought it. When i  got home i put it in and watched the whole thing for the first time. It made me feel kind of mushy inside. Then i watched it over and over again.  I must have watched it about 40 times that night.  I think that it is the best movie i have ever watched in my life i havent yet found a better movie.  I think that is the best movie in my whole house.	5.0	Kitten's Thought's on the Dirty Dancing	2001-08-01	1	1	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A12BHU5MRHEMJJ	Kristin L. Cozad	Can't believe I watched it on tv twice in a row - my hubby snickered and wouldn't watch it with me - at 33 yrs. old you would think maybe it wouldn't appeal as much as when I was 21 but - WOW!  It is a beautiful love  story which, hopefully, many of us ladies can identify with.  The dance  scenes where she keeps getting embarrassed, tickled and giggles and they  keep repeating it until she gets it &quot;right&quot; - yowsa!  Hot stuff!  I have to say this is the most sensual and sexy movie I have ever viewed -  and basically no nudity - what chemistry.  Anyhow, will have to break down  now and buy the video - can't stand to have to wait for it on tv again or  rent it multiple times.  Enjoy!	5.0	Whew!

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2H3JSPF9RXIN3	K. Sowers	"Fans of ""Dirty Dancing"" seem to get hooked on it, and if you're like me, there's no such thing as watching it too many times.  There's a reason why this sleeper took off, and has remained a staple in the coming-of-age genre since its release.This film remains my personal favorite, and the 20th Anniversary Edition has it all in terms of what was going on behind the scenes, screen tests, different versions of some of the scenes, some with additional footage that was edited out, as well as scenes that were not included in the film.  The extra information on this edition highlights what it took to come up with the final version of the film, and watching the extra footage enhances our understanding of the characters we've loved, as well as the story, while showcasing the expertise of the editors in knowing what to leave out.  It's an engaging, entertaining view of what gave us the final version of ""Dirty Dancing"" that has endured."	5.0	"If you're a ""Dirty Dancing"" fan, this Anniversary edition has it all"	2010-01-24	5	5	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A3SB3PWZOE30A9	K. Walgrave	This movie is great for anyone who loves the golden 80s of movies.  Even if you don't love 80s movies and like dancing, romance, rebelious natures, scandalous situations, or even just Patrick Swayze, this movie is for you.  There is sibling rivalry, parental disapointment, a romance with an older more mature man and all without the uncomfortable feelilngs you get with so much drama in today's movies.  It isn't one of those movies that makes you want the moment to end because of how uncomfortable it makes you feel.  It'll leave you smiling and daydreaming.  In fact, whenever my husband saw this movie on tv he made fun of it until one day I asked him if he'd ever actually seen it.  When he answered no, we watched it together and he ended up loving it and bought the soundtrack the next day.	5.0	Nobody puts Baby in the corner	2007-03-19	1	1	0
0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A1KC1LJ94KLE3P	KY Bred	A classic, IMHO, although most of today's young people will not understand parts of it:  That abortions were illegal, subject to criminal prosecution then, That rock and roll was just gearing up to be part of a teenager's life.  But the final dance is worth the wait.  Patrick Swayze grew up with dancing, and he made it look so natural.	5.0	Nostalgic but classic	2013-10-22	1	1	0

I loved dirty dancing for so many reasons some of which include the great acting, the excellent plot lines, and the view on the world during the 1960's in america. I think the movie personafied the changing times of america and how that era effects us today. I also love the dances and that is why I am going to do the dances with my best friend in my high school cafeteria with a boombox starting with 'Nobody puts baby in the corner' to the lift.Also Recommended: Ghost	5.0	it never gets old	2006-02-12	3	2	1

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2KBEW2GOSLS3X	Larry C	Watching this movie brings back all those wonderfull years I spent in the Catskills with my family. I still get tearful when I see Jack Weston who is so lovable as the club owner. There were so many like him. They reminded me of this extended family all of us Italians had back in Brooklyn.....WHAT? HUGH? What am I saying.....I never went to Grossingers or the Concord or Browns or in this case Kellermans. But after watching this wonderful gem of a movie I now wish I had! These people really had something if it was anything like this movie. Imagine top entertainment, impecable grounds, families caring and sharing with themselves and others. What more could a family ask for? Here we have Jennifer Grey as this powerhouse of sexuality in a pint sized package wiggling and strutting her way through wipeout in those now famous cutoff dungaree shorts! And then there's Patrick Swayze in an electrifying performance reminiscient of John Travolta in a star making performance. The only down side is the improbable assortment of dirty dancers who are way too hip beyond the time period here. It seems out of place. Other than that a great supporting cast, a wonderful director, and a competant script make this one of the 50 best made films ever! You can't rent it.....you must own it....it's the ultimate feel good musical. I loved it!	5.0	Totally improbable yet wonderfully addicting!	2005-08-01	3	0	3

Baby and Johnny were great together.  I loved the chemistry between them, especially that first night he had her on the dance floor, I cracked up.  The friendships and the loyalty between the other cast members were great as well.  Her dad got on my nerves a bit, but he was doing his job as a father and was desperately trying to keep Baby from getting hurt.  In the end Johnny went from &#34;bad boy&#34; to &#34;good guy&#34; and taught everybody that looked down on him a lesson on morals.

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"Every time we get to the end of ""Dirty Dancing,"" and Dr. Jake Houseman (Jerry Orbach) says ""When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong,"" I always end up yelling at the screen because he never says he is wrong!  ""Dirty Dancing"" has plenty of dancing, dirty and otherwise, but the juice for this film is supplied by the contrast between Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey.  He is Johnny Castle, basically a street punk earning a living dancing up a story at a Catskills resort.  She is Frances ""Baby"" Houseman, saved from being a cute little spoiled rich girl by her social conscience, and once the two of them collide ""Baby"" starts growing up real fast.  You see, Baby does Mombo and ends up having the time of her life.  Like John Travolta, Swayze proved that when you add some major hip swiveling to smoldering good lucks, it really, really works.  Grey personified sweet innocence and the resulting contrast made this campy little film work.  Interesting footnote: originally there were some nude scenes in this film but test audiences did not like seeing Baby naked, so they were cut.  Now, isn't that romantic?Most Romantic Lines: (1) ""Nobody puts Baby in a corner.""  (2) ""I had...the time of my-y life...and I owe it all to yo-ou."" (Okay, nobody SAYS it, but it is the line you all remember.)If you like ""Dirty Dancing,"" then check out these other films on AFI's list: #31 ""The King and I"" and #30 ""Swing Time.""  Why?  Because these are movies where the dancing substitutes for the sex.  Actually, is there a hotter sex scene than the dance scene in ""The King and I""?  Also, for good measure, toss in #95 ""Lady and the Tramp"" which also features a romance from opposite sides of the track, and #19 ""Ghost,"" because it also stars Swayze."	4.0	AFI's Great Love Stories: #93 Dirty Dancing	2002-06-18	6	4	2

There she meets a dancer, Johnny, played by the handsome Patrick Swayze, and there's an imidiate attraction between them. When his dancepartner, Penny, gets pragnent, Baby sees this as her chance to ""make the world a better place"" and voluenteers to take the place as Johnny's partner in a dance contest. There's lots of hard work and dancing ahead, where Johnny is trying his best to learn Baby how do dance. But they represent two different social circles, Johnny's poor and Baby's rich, and that is meant to cause trouble...I don't know how many times I've watched this movie, but no matter how many times I'll watch it, I know I'll still love it and keep it among my favourites. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze has a chemistry you will notice right away. It does look like they're having the time of their lives!

I don't care about that fact either because nothing could convince me to put up with this boring old movie again.  I had the misfortune of seeing this some time ago, and even more misfortune of seeing the stage show.  Boring.  I'd rather pull my eyelashes out one by one or something equally as torturous.  I know I'm not going to convince many people about this mundane tired movie, but I feel better having said my peice and maybe I could save someone from the pain.	1.0	Over over overated	2005-09-08	40	7	33

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2YDWVLN3LIU3C	Liz	I remember trying to catch the movie on TV, but I always miss part of the movie. So I looked for it at Amazon so I could get it on DVD. It was on a discount. I finally got to watch the whole movie and loved it. How could you not like Patrick Swayze. I wanted this one because of the extra material that you get with it. I checked out the second disc and one of the things that they did was they got photos and videos from Dirty Dancing fans all over the country, to show how big a fan they are. It was really neat. I would recomend this to anyone who loves Patrick or a good romance movie. Nobody puts Baby in a corner.	5.0	Absolutely Love it!	2010-11-14	0	0	0
0784010218	Dirty Dancing	AYZLXLVMJGTJV	L. J Nary	This movie is so fun, the dancing is just so enjoyable to watch and the love affair between actors Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey is so real. The way they moved together playfully but professionally was capitivating. The movie was mainly positive and upbeat except for the thread of social prejudice that comes between actors Patrick and Jennifer. The modern dances mixed with the older steps all blended so well together. I haven't seen a dance movie of this calibre in a long time. I saw Moulin Rouge but it just doesn't live up to this one. The visuals in Moulin Rouge are really stunning but Dirty Dancing has more chemistry between the two actors and the dance numbers just seem better to me!

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2OTVNYVIVMM9J	Loaghaire	As soon as I heard that Patrick Swayze had passed away, this excellent movie came to mind and I added it to my collection.  The acting and the dancing were great and the story rang a bell.  I am old enough to remember when families from the city flocked to the Poconos for summer vacation and to escape the heat of the city for a few weeks.  Love affairs began and ended and friendships were made, sometimes for life.  Patrick Swayze was terrific and this was the movie that brought him the popularity that lasted throughout his career.  It is a classic and one of those movies that one can watch over again from time to time and still enjoy it. Highly recommended.Anne Meteyard	5.0	A classic movie	2009-10-28	1	1	0

This is a warm hearted view of coming of age in a time without HIV or tectonic shifts in gender and sex roles.

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A3LUO22WJPKK81	"""loveableandcuddly"""	I had heard of this film but hadn't seen it until last year. And it has to be one, if not, my all time favourite film.Baby (Jennifer Grey) is on vacation with her family. She is a typical Plain Jane, who stumbles upon the staff's area where they are dancing raunchily. Then along comes one of the dancers Johnny (Patrick Swayze). He doesn't like her, and when he has to teach her to dance with him he is not happy. But as the spend time together he sees that she is not that bad.This has some really good music, such as `I've had the time of my life', playing as the final dance sequence plays out.A dazzling film with the added bonus of Patrick Swayze being really cute and having a really good body!	5.0	Not very dirty dancing, but a great film.	2004-01-07	6	3	3
0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A1PVM3V959JFYM	Lovely to See You	"Okay, this movie is popular enough that we all pretty much know the storyline, so let's cut to the chase.  While I admittedly like this 80's hit, predictable storyline and all, I can understand why there are people who don't think it's so hot.  Oh, the dancing is excellent, the soundtrack is pretty good, and Patrick Swayze is hot.  What's not so good?  That little snot Jane Brucker has to play, Baby's sister Lisa.  Also, why does the cast all look so 60s, and yet Jennifer Grey has same big 80s hair she wore in all her other films back then?Also, whoever wrote the dialog did a pretty subpar job:Penny Johnson to Baby when she finds out Robbie knows about her pregnancy:  ""Go back to your playpen...Baby.""  It makes me laugh.Kellerman's nephew:  ""I love to watch your hair blowing in the breeze.""  *Snicker.*Lisa:  ""I don't hear an apology, Robbie!""Robbie:  ""Go back to mommy and daddy, Lisa.  Maybe you'll hear one in your dreams.""  *Chortle.""Lisa:  ""Where is my BIEGE...IRREDESCENT...LIPSTICK?""  *Aw, shut up, ya primadonna!""Johnny:  ""Nobody puts baby in the corner.""  *Histerical laughter ensues.*Okay, so I have a problem with the script, but I really do like this movie occasionally; I just don't love it.  It's good, but too flawed to be a cinematic classic.  And for the love of God, would somebody else notice what a great big bundle of energetic and underrated talent Cynthia Rhodes is?  I found her to be one of the most likable cast members in the film and she fit her part perfectly.  Not only can this girl act, but she can really move!  Jennifer Grey is a good actress, and she plays the young impressionable plain Jane who blossoms under Johnny's mentoring skills to the hilt.  This is a decent movie one gets into the mood for now and then.Now, as for the ""ultimate DD features,"" I can tell you right now that the interest level and quality is virtually nonexistent.  Most of the interviews are long and boring, the screen test is okay, and the videos of three of the songs really blow.  They only serve to remind one of just how bad most of the 80s portion of the soundtrack was, particularly that snivelly, whiny theme song that was penned by the equally snivelly, whiny Franke Previte who wrote similar drivel in the early 80's Foreigner wannabe rock group Franke and the Knockouts.  The only truly appreciable feature on this ""ultimate"" edition is the thoroughly enjoyable trivia track, but that's on the movie DVD anyway.  This two-disc set is unnecessary, so unless you're nuts about  every single aspect of this movie, my advice is to just go straight for the single DVD and leave this one to the die-hard collectors."	3.0	"3 Stars for This ""Classic 80s Film,"" and 0 for the Second DVD."	2005-07-17	8	4	4

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2XRY4KL1X0VB1	"L. Suha ""liana"""	I just bought the movie on DVD and watched it for the first time in years and remembered all over again why I liked it so much.A musical love story, much like Grease, the movie follows three weeks in the life of Frances &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman (Jennifer Grey) on vacation in the early 60's in the Catskills with her family.Early on she is attracted to Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), the bad boy of the &quot;entertainment&quot; crew though to him she is just a nuisance. However, when his partner needs an abortion and has to drop out of an impotant dance, Baby sees the opportunity both to help and to get closer to Johnny. What follows is full of great dancing, lively songs and a feel good ending.There are no great surprises to the story, it's bad boy meets, loses and regains good girl and everyone learns a lesson. However the charm of this movie lies in the great performances and chemistry between the two leads and to the great acting in the smaller supporting roles. This is what Hollywood does best and I'm not ashamed to admit that I enjoyed it.	4.0	Great fun.	2003-05-06	15	14	1

Patrick is a professional dancer and Jennifer is a fast learner.  The support actors are great too.  The story takes place in 1963 at a Jewish resort.  Baby (Grey) and her sister Lisa are the daughters of a very prominant doctor whose patient is the owner of the resort that they go to.  The family gets one of the best suites that the owner has to offer.  Baby is a rebel, yet she is loving and has a purpose.  She is not afraid to be who she is meant to be.

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2KI0LAYW1AM7R	Machina	This is one of my favorite movies, so of course I had to buy it on Blu-Ray. As this is one of my favorite movies, the only thing to review is the image quality itself of the new Blu-ray transfer.In that, the image quality is disappointing. It looks cleaner than the DVD version, but not up to par with available Blu-Ray movies from the same era, such as: First Blood, or even Enter the Dragon. The entire movie is full of aliasing in it. You can see it on people's collars, on the siding of houses. It is very noticeable and distracting, while muddling up details in the scenery shots. The colors are also off. The reds are pushed really high to where it makes anyone's red clothing stand out and the grass is slightly bluer than it should be. This effect is very noticeable in the scene just before Neil comes to recommend the Pachanga, where people are hopping around like kangaroos, one lady has red shorts and they look super-imposed over the bluish-green grass. Finally, there is also an issue with black levels that I have only seen on this BD. With my TV calibrated, I notice that the darkest spots were slightly brighter than the ones that weren't supposed to be as dark. When I turn the brightness up, they get even brighter. This issue forces me to watch it at a lower brightness than I would usually watch the movie in.I was interested in the Blu-Trivia, but it wasn't that interesting. I distracted too much from the movie and was boring information, most of which wasn't anything that you couldn't easily find out if you wanted to.I watched this on a PS3, so I'm not sure if it is PS3 specific or not; but while watching special features, I couldn't go to the menu. I had to skip to the end of the special to reach it.So, it's difficult for me to say no to buying this because it is a cleaner transfer and sometimes, that bad colors actually look nice. But I'd say to wait until a better release comes along.	3.0	Cleaner, but disappointing	2008-02-16	10	7	3

Just the phrase, ""There are no books in Johnny's room,"" reminds us that she has an inquisitive brain, he hasn't. There is nothing that would put me less in the mood for exploring the forbidden hunk's bod than having just witnessed an illegal abortion. And so on. So what works?It's the music. It's the dancing. And the spark of genius in Jennifer Grey, making dancing a metaphor for any struggle.The whole movie is worth it to watch the awkward and clumsy ""Baby"" rehearse and rehearse until she gets it right.

But, The love story is timeless and endearing. When this movie was made, the dancing was indeed Dirty Dancing..but compared to modern dancing it is tame.Patrick S. and Jennifer G. light up the screen and have very good chemistry...I wish there would have been a sequel, as what happened to the couple? Did she still go off to join The Peace Corps? Did she marry him?

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A39VX0NJB4F4R4	Mary  L. Cartee	&#34;Dirty Dancing&#34; at the time changed the direction of dance in this country.  Swayse and Grey did a very good job of a tough, loose guy while Grey turns him around.  So, so love story but loved the dancing and music of that time.  Side-line, my daughter almost got thrown out of her senior prom for trying dirty dancing with her partner.	5.0	Dirty Dancing	2012-12-10	0	0	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A32085AB24XIYS	"M. Bernadette Crespin ""Bernie"""	I can't understand how some people are against Dirty Dancing or they didn't love that such great film. Patrick Swayze is so great and wonderful. He show us that he is the best dancer that we had ever seen in the world.His performance is extraordinary. He' so cute,sexy and sweet. All the actors played wonderfully but without Patrick Swayze it would have been impossible to make this great movie.The music and the landscapes,are so nice In my case it'a movie from my generation and each I see Dirty Dancing it remembers my youth.

The movie itself looks as good as it can, just don't expect anything reference quality.  The bonus material is pretty good, but a full scale &#34;making-of&#34; doc would have been nice.

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A218519SOYIZK2	M. D. Lambert	Released 8 months after Patrick Swayze's death, this new Limited Keepsake Edition is the overall best release, especially for a fan like me. To start with, the twenty-five page Keepsake Book was beautifully filled with pictures, quotes, bios of the actors, a pop quiz, lyrics to the Kellerman's Anthem, and a forward from writer and co-producer Eleanor Bergstein. More pictures are featured on the case when you open to find the two discs. The opening menu takes you back to the movie before you ever hit play.On Disc 1 are the basic features such as Set Up, Scene Selections, and Special Features, but while the second disc has more don't think these special features aren't worth watching or the commentaries aren't worth listening to because they are. You can watch the movie with or without the commentary, but there are two different commentaries and both are great to listen to. You can also watch the movie with the trivia track that has interesting tidbits about the movie that pop onto the screen as you watch the movie. The special features are interesting, especially finding out more details about how they made the film in Kellerman's: Reliving the Locations of the Film. The Rhythm of Dancing is a documentary with Patrick Swayze that he did before his death. Dirty Dancing: The Phenomenon is more about how one movie became one of the biggest movies of all time.On Disc 2 it features so many extras that you'll spend hours going through every feature from the Dance Sequences to the Tributes, which made me cry. When you hit In Memoriam it features a lovely montage remembering Jerry Orbach, Jack Weston, Max Cantor, Emile Ardolino, and of course Patrick Swayze. They feature three separate tributes to Jerry Orbach (narrated by Kelly Bishop). A tribute to Patrick Swayze as told by brother Donny Swayze, wife Lisa Niemi, Eleanor Bergstein, Kenny Ortega, and Miranda Garrison. A tribute to Emile Ardolino as told by Eleanor Bergstein, Miranda Garrison, Kenny Ortega, with Jennifer Grey, and Luis Rodriguez. Another feature Dirty Dancing with Patrick Swayze is a must see documentary Patrick Swayze did before his death. Three music videos are featured on this disc: I've Had The Time of My Life, Hungry Eyes, and She's Like The Wind which are definitely take you back to 1987. There is also some funny outtakes and much much more!I can't say enough about this release; it is truly the best gift for a Dirty Dancing fan!!	5.0	This Is A MUST HAVE!	2012-10-03	0	0	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	This has to be one of the best movies EVER! I don't give a damn what anyone thinks. It's a terrific movie, and the ultimate edition has a s*** load of extras! And if you haven't seen this movie, why not? It's a classic, you HAVE to see it.Everyone knows the story, so I'm not going to go into that here, but the main bit I love throughout the movie, is the fact that Baby seems to almost grow and change the more she falls in love. Plus, Jennifer Grey &amp; Patrick Swayze have some great chemistry together, which they would have to, considering they're together in nearly every scene in the movie.Jennifer Grey is also 27, playing a 17-year-old in this movie. Which she does pretty well, but I never thought she'd be that old! (She's also appeared in a Friends episode, playing Mindy, for all you Friends fans out there - and she's definitely surgery to try and keep her youthful good looks)As I've already mentioned there is a lot of pretty decent extras in this, and also some easter eggs - which I surprisingly enough, managed to find, but that's cos they're pretty obvious, when you're moving around, they highlight! So easier than a lot of easter eggs out there! Included in these extras are: commentary by writer/co-producer Eleanor Bergstein; commentary by Kenny Ortega (choreographer), Miranda Garrison (assistant choreographer and actress Vivian Pressman in the film), Jeff Jur (director of photography), Hilary Rosenfeld (costume designer), and David Chapman (production designer); theatrical trailer(s); trivia track; Jennifer Grey DVD introduction; Jennifer Grey's screen test (so funny!); interviews with Jennifer Grey, Eleanor Bergstein, Kenny Ortega, and Miranda Garrison (overly long and boring); Emile Ardolino tribute; Dirty Dancing Live in Concert (this is an hour &amp; a half long, so get comfortable! It's really good, but I wasn't expecting it to be that long!); music videos: Hungry Eyes, She's Like the Wind, (I've Had) The Time of My Life; exclusive sneak peek of Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights and collectible packaging (which is pretty much annoying, until you figure out how to get into it!)My favourites out of the extras have to be the concert, and the music videos. And out of the music videos, my favourite is definitely the She's Like The Wind video. It is one of the most subtle, but romantic songs ever. And Patrick Swayze's voice totally suits the song. The video is stunning in black and white.I'm not sure what to think of the sequel to this - Havana Nights. I'll have to wait 'til it comes out, might see it, but the original is such a classic.The ultimate edition is definitely worth paying a wee bit more for. There's also an ultimate edition of the soundtrack out too - both of the soundtracks on one CD. So I have that my eye on that. But if you love these kind of films, and have some taste, add this to your collection. Now.	5.0	You'll have the time of your life watching this	2004-03-15	1	1	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2WQY1B8ZS7QRZ	"Mike Reed ""Mike Reed"""	Review no. 293. Even twenty years following it's original release, this heart warming well produced and well scripted drama is fun to watch. Heck, you could watch this movie with anyone. Someone special you're dating, a grandparent, your kids, etc. 'Dirty Dancing' is one of those films that take place in a more innocent time {circa, 1963 in the Catskill Mountains} that's a nice clean family oriented movie, YET hasn't at all become stale or out dated through out the harsh test of time. It's cast of well reknown actors and actresses, Patrick Swayze (this movie made him a star), Jennifer Grey, Jerry Orbach and Cynthia Rhoades doesn't hurt either. Some of the beloved oldies through out this flick will send chills up and down your spine. Best scene is the last ten minutes during the big dance's major finale.

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	AC1PG6J5IHKNO	"MKava ""Miranda"""	Movement and color aid in the identification of character's personalities because warm colors and motion represent Frances `Baby' Houseman's radiant energy and aspiration and because cool colors and stillness represent Lisa Houseman's insignificant, unsuccessful role. In addition, the physical appearance of each sister suits her character well.Contrary to the norm, I viewed the sequel, Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, before I had ever seen the original film, Dirty Dancing. I am basing this information on two occasions that I watched Dirty Dancing. The first time was on November 15, and the second on November 17, 2005. Both viewings were during the evening, in my home.As Frances `Baby' Houseman learned various dancing techniques, the upward motion of her body seemed soaring and free because it followed the natural tendency to move upward over a composition. Her movement in this direction indicated a strong sense of aspiration and joy as well as a position of power. During various dance routines, Baby often moved assertively toward the camera, reinforcing her confidence. This closeness also forced the audience to follow Baby on a more personal level throughout the film. The red, orange, yellow, and pink colored dresses that Baby wore were stimulating, attractive, and clearly portrayed her radiant energy.Cool colors, including blue, green, and gray, were worn predominantly by Lisa Houseman. Lisa played a much more subtle role than her sister, Baby. Her movements seemed to be choreographed with much less complexity that was hard to appreciate as opposed to the kinetic richness and beauty of Baby's dances. The relationship between the audience and Lisa was distant and rather impersonal because she often withdrew from the camera. Uncomfortable stillness upheld her role.In addition, the sisters' physical appearances suited their character well. Baby was a blue-eyed-blonde of medium height and had a bubbly personality. Stereotypically, this stood behind her successes in the dancing world, and her flamboyant relationships with the opposite sex. Even though she was beautiful, Lisa's pale skin, brown hair, and brown eyes, made her role much less memorable.Symbolic expressions powerfully reinforce each actor's character in the film Dirty Dancing.	3.0	Symbolic Expressions Powerfully Reinforce Characters (contains spoilers)	2005-12-13	9	0	9

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A34XU754HVA02N	M. Merawi	This is one of those movies that gets cornier and cornier every time you watch it, but I love it anyway.  The first time I saw it, I wanted to cry at the end, and it wasn't even sad.I would have to say that the best  things in this movie are not the acting (Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze  are attractive, and they have great chemistry together, but they aren't  Oscar nominees by a long shot); the music and the dancing are what make  &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; worth watching over and over.  It seems like  every time I watch it, I notice something else about the plot, the music,  or the dancing that had never occurred to me before.This movie is not  for everyone; if you're looking for action, or award-winning drama, or  slapstick comedy, look elsewhere.  But if you want a romantic comedy with  great dancing and music and a wonderful ending, look no further!	5.0	Corny, but still one of the best '80s movies!	2000-04-26	1	1	0

This movie is what made Patrick Swayze hot for me (I was a teenager when it came out).  I think what makes this movie so great is it's outstanding music.  It makes you want to dance!  I am puzzled, however, that it is in the future release section.  I already own the Collector's Edition version and have for some time.  At first I thought, &quot;Oh great, they are re-releasing a DVD I already own and they're putting other neat stuff on it-something which seems to happen ALOT (I.e.:  American Pie, The Mummy, Pretty Woman, etc..).&quot;  I'm happy to report that the copy I have is the same as the one being released in January, 2002.  The behind the scenes &quot;stuff&quot; makes switching to DVD's a very smart decision, indeed.	5.0	Future Release?	2001-12-31	1	1	0
0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A9JFSZ7AE7R9N	Monchel ( mya_99@webtv.net )	Dirty Dancing is one of my favoritest movie since I was about 1 or 2. I can remember it that well because I am 13 now and it is still one of the best movies I have seen. I really like the way it has action, romance, and  dancing in it. I think anyone who sees this movie will agree. I give it 5  THUMBS UP!	5.0	This is an awesome movie!	1999-02-22	0	0	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A228JH8V9Y700G	MortensOrchid	"When this movie came out it spawned a hype unlike anything I'd seen before or since.  Full of notable quotables (""No one puts Baby in a corner""), having not one but two successful soundtracks (one even featuring the one and only published vocal talents of Patrick Swayze the star of the movie!), and a semi camp classic that the famous 80s movies would go down in history for.  Looking back brings so many memories, and so much silliness.Jennifer Grey plays Baby, a nice Jewish girl who is vacationing with her family in the Catskill mountains.  I can't imagine, even in the times that this movie was set in, that any gal would tolerate being called Baby by her family, let alone be introduced and allow strangers to call her Baby as well, but I guess that was the point.  There she falls for Johnny, the sexy swaggering bad boy of the entertainment staff who dances his way into her innocent, sheltered heart.  Just a little idealistic, just a little far fetched, but just enough of a fantasy to keep things lite and airy.There werea plethora of subplots (the sister in her own infatuation with the waiter, Johnny's partner needing the abortion, the inevitable confrontation between Baby's father and Johnny, etc.).  The song and dance routines were spaced out in between enough dialogue and plot development to make it otherwise a musical, but not quite.  It's just cheesy enough to make everyone like it."	3.0	Not quite a camp classic, not quite a musical, but close enough	2008-08-14	2	1	1

This is one of my favorite movies of all time so it really meant a lot that I was able to share it with him.  After 7 months of horror flicks, a little change was nice (i love you honey).There's not much I can say about this movie that someone else hasn't already written.  I love the music, the dancing is awesome, and the story is well written.  For the longest time, I'd always cry at the end of the movie because, gosh darn it, I wanted my happy ending!  Finding it (my happy ending) with Mr. Bronson made me look at it in a completely different way.I'm done be mushy, I promise!

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2ZTKY4SAR20JT	mugirl113	"Dirty Dancing takes place in an era (the early '60s) where the rules of social engaging were completely different from the modern day. Frances ""Baby"" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) has been vacationing in the Catskills with her family for many years. Uneventfully. One summer, she falls under the sway of dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). Baby is a pampered pup, but Johnny is a man of the world. Baby's father, Jake (Law and Order's Jerry Orbach), can't see the basic decency in greaser Johnny that she can. It should come as no surprise to find that Baby, who can be as immature as her name, learns more about love and life--and dancing--from free-spirited Johnny than traditionalist Jake.I LOVE this movie!! The DVD itself is great and the bonuses are an even better treat. There are interviews, still photos, videos showing different scenes from different angles and lots of other goodies.If you love Dirty Dancing, I really recommended getting this DVD.

I can't remember, but at some point you remember that this isn't really the '60s. Oh, it was Baby's hair. Nobody puts her Aqua Net in the corner!I watched this flick for the first time ever, after having some weird compulsion that told me that everyone else in my generation had seen it. Now I know why I should have seen it when it came out - when I was in elementary school.Can anyone actually call this a good movie with a straight face? Now, I know I risk getting ""unhelpful"" votes because of my unpopular opinion, but you gotta realize that a 25-year-old man in 2004 may not have the same sort of feelings a 14-year-old girl would have in 1987.This movie is silly, unrealistic, and lacks any real conflict. I waited almost two hours to hear Swayze's most famous line. I was surprised that Baby was literally sitting in the corner. Maybe she likes to see everybody. I always sit in the corner in restaurants.Anyway, I'm giving it 2 stars for 2 reasons: 1)I respect a man who can dance without seeming a little light in his big black boots and 2)""Love is Strange"" is one of the sexiest songs of the '50s.Biggest Laugh: Patrick Swayze mouthing ""Owe it all to you,"" in a very dramatic number - right in front of Baby's parents!

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	&quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; is a coming of age fable, set in the Catskills. It's the film that made Patrick Swayze a household word, shot Jennifer Grey to the top of the world and had the entire country singing 'I've Had the Time of My Life'. The film tells the story of 'Baby' (Grey), a naive rich kid who goes slumming on the wrong side of the tracks with Johnny, a poor dancer (Swayze). The wrinkle; Johnny's actually a great guy. The cast also features Jerry Orbach - as his usual stoic self, as 'Baby's father.TRANSFER: A really nice update to the previously released DVD's. This one is anamorphically enhanced for widescreen television displays. Colors are fully satruated, rich and vibrant. Fine detail is beautifully rendered. There's a hint of film grain detected, as well as edge enhancement and the ever so slight hint of fine detail shimmering; but these are nothing to complain about. The soundtrack has also been remastered and cleaned up.EXTRAS: Lots - but oddly enough, none of them include either interviews with Patrick Swayze, or other cast members even talking about his contribution to the film.  It's like the movie happened without him! - Bizarre!!!BOTTOM LINE: Have the time of your life all over again. Great fun for the whole family.	4.0	Get Down &amp; Dirty with A Great Looking DVD	2003-12-21	2	2	0

This film along with its monstrous successful soundtrack seem like it would rule for eternity.  The love story between Johnny and Baby could not be denied.  and oh my gosh, they even took on the still much hot topic of abortion.  It's good dancing, a forbidden love story, and about a woman coming of age.  Did Johnny and Baby go one to live happily ever after-probably not...but boy, they had the time of their lives that one HOT summer.	4.0	I can not believe it's been nearly 20 years	2006-03-20	2	2	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	AVD0FQGZ6C0YX	noregrets4life33	I didn't use to love this movie. I found it to be overrated. But upon reviewing years later, all grown up, I find that it's not as bad as I originally thought. What gets me is the Johnny/Baby relationship. Whenever they aren't dancing or in bed, it looks like she's just a little kid pining for him and he doesn't want to actually be around her. It's a weird tandem, that actually ends up taking the viewer out of the viewing experience. Penny's character always kind of grated on me as well, especially the way she speaks.Overall though, it's a very interesting movie that is easy to watch, has some very sexy love scenes and great dance scenes. I'd say though that it's not appropriate for younger kids, although I think alot of young kids have been allowed to see this.P.S. The ending is just movie magic :)	4.0	A cute, time capsule look into love at a rich people's summer camp	2012-02-10	2	2	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2ODBHT4URXVXQ	"Peggy Vincent ""author and reader"""	When it was released in 1987, Dirty Dancing was a cultural phenomenon, and it hasn't faded in spite of the fact that it's dated and that the dancing, never really, really dirty, doesn't seem dirty at all, by today's standards.Patrick Swayze plays a dance instructor pretty-boy at the Catskills resort where Jennifer Grey is vacationing, as she's done every year, with her traditional family. They fall in love (or at least in lust), of course, and of course her father doesn't approve and sees to it that the guy is fired in order to denigrate him in the eyes of everyone and separate him from Grey.All this is predictable enough, but Grey and Swayze have chemistry, and boy, do they put on some sexy moves with their dancing. If you've never seen it, you're in for a treat. Just put your cynicism and modern worldliness on hold and let yourself be sucked into the spirit of the film. Enjoy it.	4.0	Iconic	2003-12-17	17	14	3

Her dad says that she is going off to college in the fall, so you should assume that she is 18.  Anyway, while the music and dancing are fun, that is not what this movie is about to me.

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	AWXPAJ7VG5D4Y	Philip Lochner	This isn't a review of the movie - the coming of age story about Baby, an uppity girl on vacation in the Catskills who learns about love, life, and how to dance while visiting a resort - but rather a review on this DVD's  ability to transform any non-DVD-believer to the new format.This DVD's  featurettes were recorded in 1987 - long ago enough that they realized the  marketing potential to have many Making Of and Extra Bonus Feature  abilities, and by including these original 1987 films on the DVD you can  *easily* compare the quality differences. This alone makes you realize why  you opted to buy the DVD over another VHS.It's fun to see the directors  and actors, in their full 1980's VHS quality, commenting on the movie. They  intercut the dance scenes as well as the dialouge without digital  conversion, and when you watch it, you notice just how much of an  improvement DVD is. Listen to the sound in the cutscenes and then replay  the same scene in the DVD, and anyone who hasn't switched to DVD certainly  will.The DVD contains all the music videos from the movie - again, in  relatively low-res VHS/MTV quality, as well as some animated backgrounds. A  great DVD for the simple fact that it's so easy to switch between what  you've seen on VHS for years (and even on at the theatres) and what is  available on DVD, quality-wise, today.	4.0	Average Movie, GREAT DVD Showcase	2000-05-14	12	9	3

This Blu-ray, it gets a 1 star (I wish I could give it less).  A common issue with early blu-ray discs are lack of qualtiy.  The color, graininess and ""WIDESCREEN"" on this Blu-ray are all a joke.  Talking to the people who did the work on this Blu-ray; if you're going to transfer garbage then all you're going to get is 1080p, hi-def garbage!  Whoever did the work on this Blu-ray release does not know what they are doing and most likely did not care.  The skin tones go from just OK to bright pink and even orange (we're talking skin tones that would make an Oompa-loompa jealous).  The transfer is also dark, lacking all the great details that the movie is known for, leaving those of us who watch this film with a less than full (forget about ""BEYOUND HIGH DEFINITION"") experience.  The graininess on every version of this film is bad and this Blu-Ray is no exception, it is very distracting.  Then, finally, the ""WIDESCREEN"" part of my review, the back of the Blu-ray tells us that it is 16x9 or 1.85.1 - DUH!  The thing is Blu-ray, of course it is widescreen!  Not to mention that they stretched the whole thing, the people look like they've all been on a mid-evil torture device.My advice is to stick with the ""Ultimate"" version of the movie on DVD and watch it though your Blu-ray player's up-converter feature.  You will end up with a much more enjoyable experience"	1.0	AVOID THIS BLU-RAY~	2010-01-18	12	5	7

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5	R. Kyle	"At the Oscars, they were predicting that musicals were going to have a resurgence.  It seemed like time to revisit some of my old favorites and see if they were as good as I remembered them to be. In the case of ""Dirty Dancing,"" I'm happy to report the answer is yes.The story's been told before.  A young girl, Baby Houseman (Jennifer Grey) goes to a summer resort and falls for Johnny Castle, the dance instructor (Patrick Swayze). There's a complication, John's partner Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) is pregnant by one of the college boys. Baby helps and ends up getting in trouble with her own dad, Dr. Jake Houseman. Johnny accepts responsibility, since the 'cad dad' won't. Johnny's from the bad side of town and the doctor just doesn't want his little girl messing around with a tough guy like him, particularly one who got his dance partner pregnant.The music's fabulous, including numbers by The Righteous Brothers, Mickey and Sylvia, etc.  The dancing is even better.  This is Swayze at his best.Well worth the time to watch and they've done a great job bringing this film to DVD, too.Rebecca Kyle, March 2009"	4.0	Still having the time of my life	2009-03-12	0	0	0

In our family, its taken on cult status -- we watch parts of it frequently, sometimes to end the evening on a happy note.  It is for us what The Big Lebowski is for our children.

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A1IPW0I8HOHGH2	R. Maynard	There've been some great ones, but to me, nothing can surpass &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; as the sweetest love story of the century.  The theme is age-old, a depiction of a maturing college-bound young woman, Frances  &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman (Jennifer Grey), who falls seriously in love with  her dance instructor, Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze).  So, what makes this  film so different?First released in the eighties, I loved it, but didn't  fully appreciate what Grey had gone through to pull it off.  Professional  dancers, instructors, recently told me that at the start of film  production, she was a good dancer --- but that's all.  However, through  intensive daily training and mind numbing determination, she became, in a  matter of months, a world class dancer --- a near impossibility.It's  Grey's personal attributes that come shining through as Baby depicts a  beginner who has exactly one week to master the elusive Mambo.  The scenes,  some hilariously funny, others poignant and touching, are accurate and  wonderfully portrayed.  I mean, it's not just the script that makes a great  film: where would Casablanca be without Bogart ---- or The African Queen  without Hepburn?You can't help falling in love with Baby, she's so  fresh, so vivacious, and, in the finale, dances so beautifully that your  heart is captured forever.  Everyone I've met who's seen the film loves it  and all own both the DVD and the CD soundtracks.If you haven't seen  it, do so now --- you won't regret it.  It's a film you'll watch over and  over, one love story that will never grow old.  (DVD)	5.0	Sweetest love story of the century	2000-07-19	0	0	0

This movie cameout in the late 80's and did fit with the time period, butnow feels so corny and lame. The plot, the acting, and justabout everything. Patrick Swayze always was an overratedactor, and how can you like Jennifer Grey? She seems likea big time whiney snob. The soundtrack helped improve themovie but couldn't save the cheese that this movie reaked.Honestly, the 80's was a cheesy decade and movies like thisand Footloose helped make that so.

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	AM2PV53UX1JEQ	R. Penola	It is awfully hard not to get swept up into the nostalgic heat and sentiment of this unabashedly, and well-done, teen romance.  It is, by turns, sexy, funny, melodramatic, jamming (what with that soundtrack chock  full of some of the best pop hits of the 60s mixed with a few great new  songs) and campy.  Yet the overriding feeling of melancholy and  wistfulness, portrayed with real talent by Jennifer Grey, as the perfect  Baby, transforms this movie into something lasting, something to really  love.  Cynthia Rhodes is absolutely riveting -- as usual -- in the second  female lead; she is a spectacular dancer and electrifying whenever she is  on the screen. The aching feeling of first true love/lust/whatever, here  directed at hunky Patrick Swayze, who is by the way an excellent dancer,  comes to full flower at a Poconos resort.  As all manner of soapy subplots  move through their predictable paces, we are treated to the transformation  of our young heroine and any number of delightful musical numbers, capped  off by the irresistably romantic Time Of My Life -- that feeling of moving  through a romance that has somehow changed your life is captured with a  rare sweetness, and it stays with you.	4.0	THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE	2000-01-06	94	86	8

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2BBQQT75F9G1Z	Ruby Marlowe	"Patrick Swayze 1952-2009. The year was 1963, Kennedy was alive and screwing, women's lib was on the verge of eruption, the summer of love was just around the corner, and the Houseman family are spending the last few days of summer at Kellerman's Resort in the Catskills. Dr. and Mrs. Jake Houseman are part of the more affluent middle-class who probably make their home somewhere in Long Island and are unabashed intellectual liberal snobs. Their daughters Lisa and Baby (real name Frances after Frances Perkins) couldn't be more of the cliched big sister/little sister polar opposites: Baby is an intellectual idealist who was more than likely forced into university (and don't you just love how Jake talks over his daughter as she suffers through a dance with the owner's nephew that she's going to be an English major when she tells him she's going for economics- get that MRS from a hotelier my dear!) and Lisa is an oblivious brushoff who is going to get hitched to the first Wall Street trader that knocks her up (interior design school be damned!). All of a sudden the roguish Johnny Castle bounds into the dance hall to samba his way into the gowns of all desperate housewives to sell dance lessons- all else verboten or it's your a$$, you working-class southern hick! Then baby carries a watermelon, pays for Penny's abortion, does a half-a$$ed performance with Johnny, he pops her cherry, and they dance to a Bill Medley classic bringing together rich and poor, opening the floodgates of freedom and love, and the rest history...Thank God I was 13 when I finally saw this saccharine-coated load! Now I distinctly remember the TV ads for Dirty Dancing back in '87, and I think it's a bit of false advertising. I was expecting something along the lines of 9 1/2 Weeks or Wild Orchid mostly because of the tight, grainy black and white shots of writhing bodies and the bright fuchsia title font. Who knew such a suggestive title could sell such an innocuous, and at times comical romance that revolved around rather intricate dancing. Dancing With the Stars my a$$! I think Eleanor Bergstein was going for a Pride & Prejudice spin on her romantic pratfalls when she was a teen mambo queen bumming around Catskills luxury resorts. I give this film three stars because the only thing that hooks me is the dancing, the soundtrack, and the realistic hardscrabble lives of undiscovered professional dancers who will do anything to survive.The cheap thrill for me (and I suspect many others) is Baby's initial descent into the dark side. Now she ""wanders"" into the staff quarters and sees one of the lackeys struggling with watermelons. Now he makes fun of her for dancing with his wannabe boss, but he's impressed with Baby's sass (as well as sincerity) and they cross the bridge (ooh, symbolism alert! Death! End of innocence! SEX! SEX! SEX!). I can't help but equate the scene where they approach this gigantic, dimly-lit barn-like structure with Joyce Carol Oates' Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been? where Connie plays pretend in the diner where the big kids hang out. So lackey butt bumps the doors open to reveal a rock n' roll orgy of fierce looking sweaty people grinding away to Do You Love Me as Baby muddles uncomfortably through the throng of sin. Johnny and Penny flash through the doors to the wild adulations of their fellow upstarts and take their place as the brother and sister king and queen of dirty dancing. Baby can't take her eyes off Johnny's tight abs and matching a$$ and Johnny gives her a once-over making her feel 2 inches tall before teasing her onto the dance floor. It all plateaus from there.All in all a distracting coming-of-age flick that could only get better with time or get wrecked with a sequel. And Dirty Dancing has weathered the storm of both gracefully."	3.0	Somewhere between a musical and a morality tale	2009-10-26	4	2	2

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2SM64C79TS70F	Russell W. Carrington	"The world did not need this movie. It has no redeeming social value. But if there must be a movie about a would-be Peace Corps idealist who gets swept into the earthy world of a brainless but hunky dance instructor, it might as well be as perfectly executed as this one.There are the characters.  Robbie the Creep, the self-centered waiter.  Neil the Nerd, who considers himself the catch of the county.  ""Baby, sometimes in life we see things we don't want to see.""  Johnny Castle, the dance instructor.  ""Nobody puts Baby in a corner."" And Baby herself.  ""I brought a watermelon.""  What gems.There are the different classes of society: the waiters, the rich clients, the low class dirty dancers.There's the goofy but perfectly constructed plot.  A pregnancy, need a dance fill-in, gotta rehearse so let's get dirty together, sorry daddy I lied, and to top it all off: I was wrong about you Johnny, and thanks for knocking up my daughter.There's even the pretense of a theme.  Some people are willing to stand up for other people, no matter what it costs them, particularly when their hormones have become involved.And to top it all off, a climactic dance number that includes every character, every theme, and every element of corn.  Johnny and Baby dance, Johnny goes and gets his dirty dancing chronies, Johnny and chronies dirty dance back to the stage, and everyone dances together.The perfectly constructed stupid movie.

My cousins would come over and bring their recorded-from-tv VHS tape and we'd watch and dance around together. Nostalgia is a big reason for my adoration of this film.Baby Houseman (Jennifer Grey) goes to a summer resort with her family just after graduating from high school. She is an idealist who intends on joining the Peace Corps. While exploring the resort grounds, she spots one of the staff, a dancer named Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). He is a rebel, but someone who has been stepped on his whole life. Baby lucks into meeting him, and the two become unlikely dance partners when Johnny's real partner (Cynthia Rhodes) becomes pregnant and needs an abortion. Baby's attraction to Johnny is soon reciprocated and the two begin a forbidden romance.The music is vital to the film, and without it, it wouldn't have a fraction of its fans. Of course, ""Time of My Life"" won an Oscar and is the most memorable. Swayze sings ""She's Like the Wind"" which provides additional emotion to an important scene. Also included are ""Hungry Eyes,"" ""Love is Strange,"" and ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow?""Men will dislike this movie, or at least feel a need to publically renounce it, but women will eat up every moment.

Full marks to the director and choreographer in an absolute master-piece - Emile Ardolino and Kenny Ortega. Great movie. Only one  observation though. While the movie is recorded 5.1 surround which allows  you enjoy it to the core, the addtional features, which are truly  collector's worth, have been recorded in Prologic mode, with the result you  are forced to listen to the songs in the main film so that you get the  theatrical feeling. In any case, since they are a bonus to the collector, I  guess one can't get too wishful. The DVD is an absolute must buy for all  music and dance lovers......	5.0	EXCELLENT EFFORT	2000-05-19	0	0	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A3UP1DFLMYIBGJ	"Sarah E. Oliver ""biogirl50"""	This is my all time favorite movie. If I could give it 10 stars, I would. The DVD features on this Ultimate Edition are quite good, but not superb. I truly enjoyed the interviews (including Jennifer Grey, Kenny Ortega - the choreographer, and many more). Did you know that Patrick Swayze brought his dog Derek to the set and he was normally perfectly behaved... until Patrick had to shoot a love scene. Then his beloved pooch would sit off the set and cry and howl (cute, huh?). There are several anecdotes like this within the interviews. I also enjoyed the music videos included on the bonus disc. Let's face it, the music of Dirty Dancing is part of its greatness! There are two separate audio commentaries, but I was disappointed that neither Jennifer Grey or Patrick Swayze, nor any other of the film's cast participated.I also own the Dirty Dancing: Collector's Edition DVD, and thoroughly enjoyed the making-of featurettes on that disc. So if you are a real Dirty Dancing fan, check out both versions.	5.0	5 stars for the movie; 4 stars for the DVD extras	2006-09-30	8	8	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	AC744LW4D4U9G	Shemogue	"I bought this DVD for Christmas & watched it again last night - more than a decade after I had packed away my old video. It is just as wonderful as I remembered and certainly remains one of my all-time favourite films. At the risk of sounding repetitious after the 281 other reviewers I will explain why.Dirty Dancing is set in a summer resort in the Catskills in 1963, a gentler, simpler time when the world (or at least the North American middle class part of it) was innocent and nave & hovered on the cusp of vast social change. It was before the Kennedy assassination & the morass of Viet Nam, before student riots and feminism and The Pill, before the Beatles, and just as Motown music was hitting our consiousness.In 1963 swear words did not appear in print, let alone on TV. Movies and books told a story with a ""moral"". The good guys always won & the bad guys got their just desserts. Pregnancy out of wedlock was the greatest disaster that could befall a young girl, usually solved by her family sending her ""to visit an aunt"" out of state for a year, putting the baby up for adoption & drawing a veil of silence over the episode. (This actually happened to a school acquaintance of mine in 1963: everyone knew, but it was never, I repeat, NEVER, spoken of again).The film has a particular resonance for our generation who came of age at that time. The heroine was 17 years old in 1963, exactly my age then. I worked at a summer resort & knew someone just like Johnny Castle, played by Patrick Swayze in the film. I think most women have a Johnny Castle one summer in our youth.In 1987 it was mothers who dragged their protesting daughters to see the movie. It has spawned a host of imitators & remakes, the best of which is probably the Australian-made ""Strictly Ballroom"". There is also a recent remake ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"", set in Cuba which has a following among a new young generation although I have not seen it. Now, a new DVD of Dirty Dancing is being issued for the children & grandchildren of the original fans.Dirty Dancing bears its age well. It is well worth seeing again, besides hearing that wonderful music that threads through the film: Cry to Me, Will You Love Me Tomorrow, In the Still of the Night, Soul Man, Hungry Eyes and the finale piece ""I've Had the Time of My Life"" sung by one half of the Righteous Brothers duo, the golden-voiced Bill Medley.(originally submitted Jan 3,2007)"	5.0	As wonderful as I remembered	2007-02-05	0	0	0

I have watched it thousands of times and don't know many people who haven't seen it.  I've always loved Patrick Swayze, but when he started moving the way he did in Dirty Dancing I loved him even more.  I've even started dancing lessons since seeing this film.  It's so good the way he picks Baby in the end to dance with him at the final show.  Her dad was so proud of her and that brought a tear to my eye.  As for the quote ""nobody puts Baby in the corner""....it'll never be forgotton!!!  Well recommended viewing.

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	AHM34T08NODD2	"""steendean"""	As a young child (born in 1980) I loved this movie, though I wasn't allowed to see it in its entirety until I was a young teenager. Filmed in my home state of NC, Dirty Dancing is a splendidly romantic film about a time (the early 1960s) and a place where life was much simpler by today's standards. The music is fantasic (this movie introduced me to Otis Redding), the dancing is even better, and Patrick Swayze absolutely makes the movie! He is not only an incredible dancer, but a fine actor as well. Though he was in his mid-thirties when the movie was made, he convincingly plays the somewhat older, jaded bad boy dance instructor with panache. Jennifer Grey is lithe, talented, and beautiful as Baby, the idealistic rich girl who falls in love with Johnny. Jerry Orbach is great as Baby's dad, and the other, lesser-known actors are great as well. Yes, sometimes the dialogue is corny, and the good-girl-loves-bad-boy plot is both unrealistic and familiar, but it is the way in which the actors portray these characters that they become memorable. This is the perfect girls' sleepover movie; in fact, I like to show a trilogy of romantic &quot;girl&quot; movies at my sleepovers: most notably Dirty Dancing, Shag, and School Ties. Sometimes I show Pretty in Pink, too. Watch this movie one hot summer night with one of your best gal pals!	5.0	FORBIDDEN FRUIT	2004-03-29	1	1	0

But besides that crap it was fairly good. I mean any movie with my main man Patrick has got to be good. But that one lady that is like like 11 and is named Baby, she is like a big minus. Ok she lugs watermelons around as a hobbie. Then she like trys to be cool by danceing in a dark coner by herself. Then Patrick kidnaps here and leaves here in a forest in the rain. GOOD JOB PAT.

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A26A8T38C2GQD7	Taheen Lopez	"The Summer of 1963 innocent 17-year-old Baby vacations with her parents at a Catskill's resort. One evening she is drawn to the staff quarters by stirring music. There she meets Johnny(Patrick Swayze), the hotel dance instructor, who is as experienced as Baby is naive. Baby soon becomes Johnny's pupil in dance and love.As with GREASE (1978) and FOOTLOOSE (1984) before it, DIRTY DANCING was a cultural phenomenon that now plays more like camp. That very campiness, though, is part of its biggest charm & if the dancing in the movie doesn't seem particularly ""dirty"" by today's standards--or 1987's--it does take place in an era (the early '60s) when it would have.Frances ""Baby"" Houseman (Jennifer Grey, daughter of ageless hoofer Joel Grey) has been vacationing in the Catskills with her family for many years. Uneventfully. One summer, she falls under the sway (as it were) of dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). Baby is a pampered pup, but Johnny is a man of the world. Baby's father, Jake Houseman(Law and Order's Jerry Orbach), can't see the basic decency in greaser Johnny that she can. It should come as no surprise to find that Baby, who can be as immature as her name, learns more about love and life--and dancing--from free-spirited Johnny than traditionalist Jake.DIRTY DANCING spawned two successful soundtracks, a short-lived TV series on CBS, and a stage musical.It may be predictable, but Grey and Swayze have chemistry, charisma, and all the right moves. It's a sometimes silly movie with occasionally mind-boggling dialogue--""No one puts Baby in a corner!""--that nonetheless carries an underlying message about tolerance and is filled with the kind of exuberant spirit that's hard for even the most cynical to resist. Not that they'd ever admit it.This drama flick also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 14 going on 15 years old and a Freshmen in high school during its theatrical release in the Summer of 1987."	5.0	Dirty Dancing Rocks!	2013-12-18	1	1	0

Yeah, the story is lame, that acting barely O.K., but who cares? Nothing makes us feel better than that last dance. The rest of the music is top notch and fun and the dancing fantastic. No one, but no one, would be caught dead dancing like that these days tho'or so it would seem. But again, who cares? It's also kind of fun watching the other dancers. Take a close look and watch them ham it up. It's hilarious. Also, having watched it several (who knows how many?) times, I finally noticed a young girl and boy who seemed to be showing up also in several key scenes. The producer's kids maybe? Bottom line, it was Swayze at his absolute best, gorgeous, hunky, sweet, perfect hair, beautiful shy smile. That's why we loved him in this movie and 'Ghost', I guess, and that's why we will miss him.	5.0	Who can resist?	2009-11-02	2	2	0

One of the biggest hits from the late '80's ( the film has grossed so far 213 million dollars), ""Dirty Dancing"" stars Jennifer Grey (Joel Grey's daughter) as a young girl who falls in love with a good-looking dance instructor (played by Swayze) in 1963 much to the chagrin of her father. The movie is notable for its amazing soundtrack and the fact it won the Academy Award that year for Best song for ""(I've Had) The Time of My Life"". The film would be the first ever sell a million copies on home video. Kenny Ortega, most famous now for choreographing ""High School Musical"", got his start in ""Dirty Dancing"" creating the dance steps.

I mean, let's get right down to it - it's RUBBISH, OK? Everyone knows it, yet mention it to a certain demographic of empty-headed girls and they all cluck and sigh and say how much they love it etc. Fools.For the record, The Curmudgeon is not some stony-hearted macho man. Hey, probably my all time favourite movie is Wizard Of Oz. But we're not here to talk about the good stuff, remember (read my profile) - only the bad. And oh man, is this ever bad.It's not the dancing I resent - I don't mind that. It's some of the stupid plot devices that really grate on me, and they're the ones that usually get the girls all gooey and resting their cheeks on their hands.Plot device one - Patrick Swayze blubs at the end of this movie because of all the sex he gets. Yep, he's actually UPSET about the amount of MILFS he manages to pull in the job he has. ""They just use me"", he sniffs. OH BOO HOO - Poor you. Sorry, we're supposed to FEEL for this character?  Did those women FORCE him to bang them all? Give me a break.Plot device two - one of the girls gets pregnant sleeping around. Whoops, well, that's what happens. Nothing wrong with a bit of a moral in the tale here and there. But - girl gets abortion, so - abortion girl crys, the lead girl crys, Swayze looks ""deep"" - alright. But - NEXT SCENE(!!) Swayze and lead girl are in his house dancing - cue romantic music - cue first kiss - cue sex scene. Yes, nothing like an abortion to get you in the mood for more casual, pre-maritial sex. JUST the sort of thing we want to shove down the throats of the impressionable 12 year old girls watching.""Nobody puts baby in the corner"", quothe old plasticine face at the end.

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A1TDA1H21GLT0N	The_Lawyer	"Even though I was 11 years old when this movie came out in 1987, I knew there was something magical about the story.  What a glorious time during those ""Wonder Years"" of the late 80's. So, here you have a movie that takes place in the 60's but uses 80's music during the pivotal scenes.  That is the first strange aspect of this film. This movie proves one thing, and as a white suburban male I can say this with experience and accurate observation: The suburbs are overly predictable, boring, and  the birthplace of aesthetically bland and mind numbing activities as shown in the recreational activity scenes of this movie.As a political scientist college graduate, I appreciate the outright class prejudice that this movie teaches us about. You have the White suburban family lead by the following characters: a physician father with all the expectations and prejudies that typically characterize most wealthy suburbanite males , the passive, somewhat attractive but emotional mother, the dumb sexually active sister, and of course Baby, the liberal, soft spoken, and sexually frustrated ""daddy's girl"".Then you have Patrick Swayze in his breakout homo-erotic role as a bus boy who is the gigolo for Westchester County Socialites who crave slumming with the blue collar crowd. Swayze's character is both the alphamale (as a dancer) and the lost mamma's boy in search of Baby's characer who will fill the void in his life left by the stagnancy of his own lower class existence.So what ultimately is the point of this movie?? Well, rich liberal suburban girls love to dance with blue collar men who make them hot and bothered in ways the country club set could not possibly do on any given Sunday. I love this movie as a guilty pleasure because I am elated when the class lines are blurred and conventional stereotypes are deflated by people with honest emotions and sincere intentions. If Patrick Swayze's character was Black, well then!!!, this would be the movie to beat in all genres because as is well known, the greatest fear of white suburban parents like those portrayed in this movie is that their innocent little girl will get corrupted by the black man with rhythm. So if Swayze's character was black, this movie would not have been the success that it is... thus proving that back in 1987 we were still 1,000 yrs away from meaningful racial tolerance.

I was very young at the time, and my mother says that if she even attempted to pull me out of the t.v. room when it was on, I would go balistic. I have had &quot;eyes&quot; for Patrick Swayze ever since. He did an outstanding job in this film along with Jennifer Grey. You feel their every emotion, and you tune into what the dancing means spiritually to their characters, and start to feel it yourself. By far, as I said, this was, is, and will always be one of the best movies in cinimatic history, and will forever always be my favorite.	5.0	The best film known to me through out movie history!	2003-11-11	7	4	3

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A1O0TOFN85RIPH	T. Lewandowski	Dirty Dancing is a favorite of mine, and I'd rate the movie as 4-stars.  The HD presentation, however, is only, fair.  Even the blu-ray version of this film isn't on par with high-def standards.  I've read the original film transfers are at fault, and not a lot was done to clean it up.  However, I had rented this film from Amazon Instant Video in the past, and the HD quality was no better than SD.  So, Amazon has taken steps to improve the stream as it does look better than standard definition, but still not as clean as most of the other HD streams I see with AIV.	3.0	New and Improved HD stream?	2014-05-01	0	0	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A3E0QQAGOVRZAU	tndowney	I've seen this movie more times than I can remember.  It's just so well done, with a great mix of family angst, young love, social commentary on the &#34;classes&#34;, and a setting perfect for the story.A family oriented resort provides a great back-drop for this coming-of-age story.  We get to see many points of view, and a thorough behind the scenes look at all that goes into running a place like that.What the movie is really about for me though, is the dancing, and there's plenty of that to go with the excellent sound track.  There are direct scenes, and excellent montages of Francis learning to dance with Johnny Castle, the lead dancer of the entertainment crew.  We also see of course many other dance scenes, but that is the heart of the movie.If you've never seen this, please do.  It just might end up in your collection of movies you watch over and over again.	5.0	Can't get enough of this classic!	2014-05-19	0	0	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A1XOQOW2HJSOIV	"Trekkintheplains ""Take a sad song and make it..."	"As other reviewers have said, this movie is timeless. It was made when I was about 5 years old but when I first saw it at the age of 16 I fell in love! And no, not over Patrick Swayze's six pack and pecks (although they are added bonuses!) but over the heart and humanity of the story. The story takes place in the summer of 1963 ""Before President Kennedy was shot, before the Beatles came"" as Baby, the heroine, says. She and her Mom, Dad and sister are on their way to a family vacation spot. Baby is sort of a wallflower, she has her own ideas and ambitions but no spark to her life. Then, she sees Johnny Castle, a tall, rebellious dance instructor. When Penny, Johnny's dance partner, finds out she's pregnant and decides to get an illegal abortion, Baby becomes involved in the struggles of the teens and twenty-somethings barely making a living among the ""elite"".Baby then makes a deal to learn how to dance so that both Johnny and Penny can keep their jobs. I love these scenes when she and Johnny are arguing over the dance steps. The scene with ""Hungry Eyes"" is one of my favorites! In the course of this, we see Baby's evolution from dowdy clothing to great clothes and makeup! And once she shows some spirit, the story really begins. Johnny learns to respect her and she sees the true person hidden behind the tough exterior.Of course, there has to be conflict. When Penny's abortion threatens her life, Baby again saves the day by bringing her doctor father in to save her. Johnny takes the wrap for the pregnancy and at the same time, Baby makes a bold move!Penny's pregnancy and Baby's automatic assumption that the child is Johnny's is typical of the wealthy's view of people considered ""low"" class. The fact that it is Robbie's, the med. student waiter, shows the truth of life. Appearances are deceiving. This movie is a lesson for anyone willing to automatically lean on stereotypes. Baby's Dad was sure Johnny was the bad guy and was all ready for Lisa (his other daughter) to marry Robbie!If I say any more, I will give away the whole plot. But believe me, it only gets better and better! Dirty Dancing is all about having fun, giving people a chance, not falling in to stereotypes and not being afraid to fall in love! This rings true for any generation. This movie is a MUST WATCH for anyone!"	5.0	This is the Time of ANYONE'S Life!	2004-06-17	3	2	1

Attempting to make the best of the situation, Baby attends the organized classes on merengue dancing and wig demonstration. Suddenly, all of that changes when she meets Johnny Castle, the resort's dance instructor. With Johnny, Baby learns the steps to a new dance--a dirty dance--that allows her to discover new strengths and new talents in order to define her place in a rapidly changing world. Under the influence of Rhythm and Blues, Baby can now express herself and her love for Johnny. It's very romantic and heart warming movie. Not only that but it makes you want to get up dance through the most of the movie.	5.0	Dirty Dancing	2010-01-05	2	2	0
0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2HRJM7G0Z4WF2	T. Waller	Dirty Dancing is up there with just a few dozen films, the Classic Love Story which has taken us from the 40's and 50's (Brief Encounter/Casablanca)to An Officer and Gentleman, Ghost and Pretty Woman.The Music is great too, a collection of late 50's and early 60's hits that spanned the World.Such is the appeal of this classic film it has crossed over to the Stage with the London West End production a sell out, soon it is to open in Toronto, and I am sure the live versions will be every bit as good as the flim, for the Dancing will be a stage production dream.If you have never seen Dirty Dancing, then live a little and buy it now, you will not regret it!

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A18758S1PUYIDT	Viva	Would you believe I'd never seen this movie till this year?  Yep, it's true.Anyway, Dirty Dancing is a relatively simple story, with quite a few scenes where there is no dialogue, and many scenes of practicing for a dance or really dancing.  The cast is not fantastic but perfectly decent, and this is a very watchable and enjoyable flick for a rainy afternoon or an evening at home.  Patrick Swayze truly was a great dancer with a marvelous body, may he rest in peace.  Jennifer Grey made a good partner for him as Baby, the girl from a well-off family who falls for a guy who came from the streets.  It's a familiar plot, but it is pulled off well here.	5.0	Simple but effective story with great dance scenes	2010-01-09	2	2	0

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	AD4FRVD8ZJ9JU	"Walter D. Tanner ""Walt"""	Hi,This is one of the best films of the 80's. Seen it on a date, As a guy I thought going in another chick flick, but its more then that. Myself I come from a similar working class background as Johnnys character and always enjoyed some of the classic dancing done in the film, but in the 80's and a guy you were considered gay for wanting to dance like this, but the movie changed this for all guys who dug ditchs in the day and wanted to dance at night, it was okay to dance. Hell the women of the time wanted you to dance like this after this movie came out.The DVD itself is the best transfer I have seen every and the sound is excellent, throw your other disks and vhs tape in the garbage this is it. And finally a Patrick Swazyie interview to boot. The reason I got it early was due to my winning a contest for the pre-release DVD and one night showing of the movie. To say that my wife was thrilled to bits would be an understatement. (Not the same girl on date, new and improved)This is definately a sleep-over movie for girls of all ages, the theatre showing enforced this concept. And Guys take your Girl to this movie or buy it for her on DVD, they will be smiling at you for days to follow.(You sensitive Man you).	5.0	Excellent Transfer, Cultural Iconic Movie	2007-05-03	9	8	1

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A2J9QBVH149J29	Wayne Minge	I bought this DVD on the day it was released and I must say this is a very extensive and the BEST DVD release ever of Dirty Dancing! I am so glad it is in widescreen and not stupid fullscreen (which is very annoying). You can defenitly tell that the sound has been remastered..I could not believe my ears. And all the special features is mind blowing. Throw away all your other versions of this film as like I said this is the most extensive and best DVD version ever released. The film is presented in a widescreen format of 1.85:1 with tons of new features including all new interviews with Jennifer Grey, writer Eleanor Bergstein, and others. Along with Deleted, Alternate, and Extended Scenes and very funny Gag Reels/Outtakes. Just take my word for it..BUY IT NOW if your a true Dirty fan! I do not think this movie should EVER be released in fullscreen format because if so then it will be taking away some of the picture in the film and the movie would just be terrible if it was in fullscreen as you do not get the full effect of it in fullscreen like you do in widescreen.

0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A34IO99RV6PLSM	William	The film is about Frances Houseman (Jennifer Grey), nicknamed Baby, a pretty middle-class teen-ager who finds her adult identity in her first love affair - with Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), the hotel's dance instructor. For a girl of Baby's conventionally liberal, Jewish background (she's planning to study ''third world economics'' in college), Johnny, a young man from the wrong side of the tracks, exemplifies the freedom expressed through a new and as yet socially unacceptable form of dancing. This ''dirty dancing,'' a phrase used only in the film's title, features a lot of steamy body contact and pelvic thrusts, which unleash emotions supposedly left withered by mambos and cha-cha-chas.Taking a formula that is itself creaky of joint and infirm of body, Eleanor Bergstein, the writer, and Emile Ardolino, the director, have made an engaging pop-movie romance of somewhat more substance than one usually finds in summer movies designed for the young.I suspect that one's responses to ''Dirty Dancing,'' to its period details, even to its state of mind, will depend on the associations one brings into the theater. What is undeniable, however, is a basic decency of feeling, shaped, in part, by the film's obligations to its optimistic genre.Baby, as written by Miss Bergstein and played by Miss Grey (''Ferris Bueller's Day Off''), is no bubble-brained teen-ager, but a bright, inquisitive young woman who's on her way to being her own person. Miss Bergstein is much better on creating character than in re-imagining formula events. Baby's liberation comes through her forbidden association with the womanizing Johnny Castle, after his partner, Penny (Cynthia Rhodes), becomes pregnant and Baby agrees to substitute for her in a mambo demonstration at another hotel.There's a really quite awful subplot about Penny's abortion, financed by money that Baby has borrowed from her conventionally liberal doctor-father, and about the arrogant young Ivy League fellow who is responsible for Penny's condition.Given the limitations of his role, that of a poor but handsome sex-object abused by the rich women at Kellerman's Mountain House, Mr. Swayze is also good. He's even convincing when he must admit, in one of the film's lesser moments, that ''the reason people treat me like nothing is because I am nothing.'' He's at his best - as is the movie - when he's dancing.The movie makes a lot of good use of period music, to which some not very evocative new songs have been added. The dancing itself, especially the dirty dancing, choreographed by Kenny Ortega, looks very contemporary, or, at least, as contemporary as ''Saturday Night Fever,'' but it has a drive and a pulse that give the film real excitement. Though the film takes place in 1963, just a year after the twist was all the rage, the twist itself seems already to have come and gone at Kellerman's Mountain House. The women's clothes also look surprisingly mid-80's and, in 1963, would anybody have used the term ''wimp''?These anachronisms aren't especially important, except that Miss Bergstein has been so specific about the film's period. She seems to want ''Dirty Dancing'' to be seen as a fond goodbye to a comfortable, liberal American way of life before the country was radicalized by the assassination of President Kennedy and by the increasingly bitter anti-Vietnam War movement. That's loading a small movie with rather more than it can carry without a lot of highly detailed program notes.''Dirty Dancing'' works best when it's most direct and unpretentious. It has the kind of sweet simplicity that somehow always eludes John Hughes (''Sixteen Candles,'' ''Pretty in Pink,'' ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off''). Mr. Ardolino, whose background is in theater and in television dance films, doesn't clutter the film with extraneous, sentimental detail, nor even with too much colorful (and familiar) detail about life in your usual Catskill resort hotel. He also obtains excellent performances from his cast, which, in addition to Miss Grey, Mr. Swayze and Miss Rhodes, includes Jerry Orbach, as Baby's father; Jack Weston, as the owner of Kellerman's, and Lonny Price, who is especially funny as Mr. Weston's arrogant, wimpish grandson.''Dirty Dancing,'' which has been rated PG-13 (''Special Parental Guidance Suggested for Those Younger Than 13''), includes some vulgar language and a lot of dancing that is comparatively erotic. Watch Your Step DIRTY DANCING, directed by Emile Ardolino; written by Eleanor Bergstein; director of photography, Jeff Jur; choreography by Kenny Ortega; music by John Morris; edited by Peter C.

Also you have more commentary tracks that you could have anticipated with Feature Length commentary by the writer/coproducer, another commentary where coreographer, her assistant, cinematographer, costume designer and production designer all drop in their two cents to share every detail of the dance moves to the wardrobe selection.There is a third commentary track by others involved in the production.But if instead of several hours to watch the movie with their commentary tracks all you got is a few minutes to enjoy additional stuff, try the original Jennifer Grey screen test... yes, the audition she did before selected to star in the movie!  To satisfy your curiosity, there is an interview with Jennifer and the production team.But the most important things, IMHO, are the exclusive sneak peek of Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, to satisfy your curiosity about the ""sequel"" which is only a new and different movie with a similar story line and the same title.  Plus, three music videos: Hungry Eyes, She's Like the Wind, (I've Had) The Time of My Life.For Patrick Swayze fans, unfortunately, there is nothing new of him here... besides the aforementioned music video."	4.0	Ultimate Dirty Dancing Experience	2003-12-07	1	1	0

Leibowitz	"I can watch this movie again and again, and not only because the dancing is wonderful and sexy, but because it bravely tackles many difficult issues, from family relations to abortion to class differences to (unspoken) racial and religious issues. I watched this movie with a friend who vacationed in the Catskills (those were the only resorts that allowed Jews) when she was little.  She said the movie brought back many memories for her--it caught the atmosphere of that time very well. There are unspoken racial issues, too, as the band leader was black (and the music, Cuban and black).I even watched it with my boyfriend, who attended Cornell University and instantly picked up on the guy who attended Cornell's hotel school! (""We used to look down on those guys,"" he said.) So, so much in this movie. The relationship between the father and daughters alone has more to it than most films. The elder, obnoxious daughter is usually overlooked, but she is so well acted.I am thrilled that the DVD has extras. This movie has much to teach us, still."	5.0	Fascinating snapshot of people and times on verge of change	2006-02-15	3	2	1

Since those days, we've played the CDs incessantly and watched and watched the video, in widescreen. We couldn't wait to see the DVD version ( We pre-ordered for safety) and now we have it we can savour it all over again and again with a myriad of extras due to the capability of the new format, in perfect audio and video. My suggestion ? - BUY!!!	5.0	Well worth waiting for	2001-02-14	0	0	0
0784010218	Dirty Dancing	A3O536E2YOKK4Y	Wuchak	"I finally got around to catching ""Dirty Dancing"", which was the hit romantic-drama of 1987. The two main cast members are a highlight. Patrick Swayze is in his prime and Jennifer Grey is cute & nimble like a fawn.Patrick plays Johnny Castle, a working-class dance instructer at a mountain resort in the Catskills in 1963.  Grey plays ""Baby,"" a 17-year-old daughter of an afluent Jewish doctor vacationing at the resort. She takes the place of Johnny's dance partner after his partner gets pregnant, albeit not by Johnny; Baby naturally develops a crush.The story keeps your attention but you'll roll your eyes at the classic misunderstanding (Baby's father assumes Johnny got his partner pregnant) and the sexual union of Johnny & Baby is both premature and unfitting to that time period and Baby's upbringing. In addition, the fact that Johnny is having sex with the doctor's daughter, a minor at that, can't win any points in his favor. Hence, even without the misunderstanding there's little reason for the father to warm up to Johnny.But I did love the lush Appalachian locations, filmed at Mountain Lake Resort, Pembroke, Virginia, and Lake Lure, NC. Gorgeous!GRADE: C+ or a strong 3/5 Stars"	3.0	1987 hit	2010-06-05	2	1	1

I love the story, the dancing, the clothes of that era which was a real time of change in this country. I miss Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray's face - she was &#34;beautiful in her own way&#34; as her sister in the movie said!	5.0	Always good!	2014-03-25	0	0	0
