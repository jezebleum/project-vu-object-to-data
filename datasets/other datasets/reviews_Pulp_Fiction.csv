1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2WL8401W82OTA	1957GoldTop	When people ask what my favorite movie is, I almost hate to say it's Pulp Fiction.  The reason I hate to say it is because people think &quot;whatever&quot; as if I'm just jumping on the Pulp Fiction bandwagon and following all the people that say it's such a great movie.  I don't think that's as much of a problem any more since there's probably more Tarantino/Pulp Fiction backlash than anything else now days.  But, in all honesty, I thought this was an amazing film long before I knew what people would be saying about it (I saw it the day it opened and knew nothing about it... see below as to why I saw the movie in the first place)I'm sure there isn't much that needs to be said about this movie that hasn't already been said.  I'm sure most people have seen it and most people know what its about.  But I can say that this is the first movie that made me realize movies aren't just some people standing in front of a camera talking.  I had always watched movies as pop entertainment.  I never really thought about them as far as artistic matters are concerned.  But, after I saw this move (again and again and again) I realized that there was more to movies than just some people standing in front of a camera and talking.  I started to realize that things were done for a reason.  The camera movement, camera angles, the editing, everything was done with a purpose.After seeing Pulp Fiction I became fascinated with movies.  Now after all the years since its release I've learned a lot about movies and can appreciate them on another level.  I see things that, until Pulp Fiction got me interested in movies, I would have missed.  So, thanks to Pulp Fiction I have a great appreciation for movies... as entertainment and now as art as well.  Now, when I re-watch movies that I had seen before, I can watch them with a new appreciation and understanding.Just to illustrate how little I knew about movies and how I only viewed them as pop entertainment and nothing more... the only reason I went to see Pulp Fiction movie when it first opened was because Bruce Willis was in it.  Not that there is anything wrong with Bruce Willis, but I'm sure you know the type of movie he is known for (heck, it was even mocked by Robert Altman and Bruce himself in &quot;The Player.&quot;).  Those were the movies I liked because they had a lot of explosions and excitement.  I didn't know what a truly great movies was before Pulp Fiction.So that is why Pulp Fiction is my favorite movie and one of the best movies I've ever seen.  If you haven't seen it... which I doubt since I think everybody has seen it by now, then you need to see this movie.	5.0	In a word, Amazing!	2001-12-08	3	1	2
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2OPX6SFRKRLWA	24fan957	I enjoyed this movie- it was unpredictable and exciting throughout.  The end was my favorite part- but I liked the &quot;miracle&quot; and Bruce Willis scenes too.  Unlike a lot of other movies, violence in this film is  not comical; it's always to an end.  That's why I was quite horrified when  people laughed at Jules and Vince as they blew the guy with the .44 away,  and at the subsequent car death scene.  Fortunately, the use of guns as  overly powerful extensions of will is well-played.  For instance, Pulp  Fiction is actually less violent than your typical James Bond movie.  The  difference is that Pulp Fiction brings the reality of murder to light as a  horrific act, while Bond goes around randomly killing fools and hooking up  with attractive nuclear physicists.  I have to say that I enjoyed Pulp  Fiction more than The World is Not Enough.	5.0	excellent film, but be careful combining violence &amp; comedy	1999-12-11	10	8	2
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1ALOIPRR8Q06J	"2 cents ""meaningless memes"""	"If somebody pointed a gun at me and said,""You gotta have an opinion -about what the best movie of the 90s is"" I'd tell them to point that gun away from my head before it accidently goes off. And then for lack of a better answer to this impossible question, I would answer PULP FICTION. In anycase, anyone crazy enough to point a gun at somebody while asking their opinion about what the best movie of the 90s is might not like other answers I might come up with as much.I think it is the funniest movie I've seen that actually doesn't go in the comedy section at the video store. There are no flaws in it. It's perfect. Quentin Tarantino cannot ever top it and will probably never even come close. When he dies they will refer to him first and foremost as the director of PULP FICTION. His place in history as one of the great directors of cinema is secured with this film."	5.0	A Freak Occurrence	2008-04-15	1	1	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3L2856DIMUXJY	&#34;Belgo Geordie&#34;	Having last watched it on release in 1994, I went back to see how it stood up in 2013. Samuel L Jackson remains the stand out and some of the dialogue is still very, very funny. It is the &#34;Violent Misadventures&#34; which exploded in 1994 which now just come across as graphic, cartoon violence and like the genre they are based on, serve no purpose but to titillate. 148 minutes is a big ask but there is enough still in the film for it not too drag. This time I was not so impressed by Ms Thurman and Mr Travolta's twist scene but still shuddered at the adrenaline shot to the heart. Tim Roth still had the ability to take the dialogue out into the weird and Bruce Willis was, well Bruce Willis. I would watch Mr Jackson again as he remains for me, a superb actor, but not the movie in full.	4.0	More pulp 'n fiction with a bit of crackle	2013-12-25	0	0	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3GM4AA744X74H	777	As I read over these reviews, two things bother me in particular. The first is the tendency of the 5 star ratings to glorify and idolize Pulp Fiction as if it were the greatest artistic achievement ever. The second is  the tendency of the low reviews to trash the movie on so-called  &quot;moral&quot; grounds. Pfft. The content of the movie is trash? Go  figure, because that's basically what all pulp fiction is. That's the  *concept* of the film. And in any case, I think it's absolutely ludicrous  to judge a film on your own personal moral grounds. To me, a movie like  Independence Day is far more immoral and sick than this. Even certain  Disney films. Onscreen violence and a lack of a socially  &quot;relevant&quot; message does not mean that the said film is a work of  Evil, and certainly does not make it a bad piece of cinema. Pulp Fiction is  a vital, energetic, unique (I know Tarantino borrows a lot of his ideas,  but so does everyone, and I'll argue with anyone who says his usage of them  is not original), and unflinching film. As for accusations of Pulp Fiction  trying to be &quot;hip,&quot; well -- let me just say I found the dialogue  and camera-work in this movie a LOT more entertaining than in any of the  post-Pulp Fiction imitations that've come since 1994, and there have been a  lot of them. Personally I like this movie a great deal, it just bothers me  to see it worshipped and/or treated like it were the work of Satan.	5.0	.	1999-10-15	13	11	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1LBAC84TLIGAX	"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF"""	Pulp Fiction is still regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made, and why should it change from that rank? This movie is basically a crime drama that follows the stories of different gangsters and what happens to them throughout the movie. The movie can be really funny in certain areas while giving you the classic drama feel, along with a recreation of how people seem to live. There is drug use and a lot of language, so parents shouldn't let there kids watch this movie, because it's an adults movie, and plus most kids don't know how to appreciate something this good(Stupid High School Musical!

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A6NJ1GAUXC1JW	A Customer	"I don't have enough things to say about this excellent collector's edition DVD.For starters, people will love the transfer.  They actually took the time (and the money) for full wrap-around arthroscopic hi-res 5:3:9 ratio.Second, the special features are choice.  As some of you may know, Michael Jackson actually tried out for the part that was eventually given to Samuel Jackson.  Well, as we all know, Samuel Jackson got the part - and the rest is history.  However, apparently MJ's performance was intense and his screen tests are available in the extra features of this Collector's Edition.Also a little known fact is that Jonathan Winters was to have a cameo in the film, but became ill during the shooting.  His scene and part were eventually cut from the film, but you can see this on the ""deleted scenes"" features.  Cool stuff!  (This is why when John Travolta's character is talking about ""Green Man"" it doesn't make any sense - Jonathan Winters was Green Man, but his scene was cut).Another deleted scene is an extended scene of Scientologist, John Travolta taking a dump in Bruce Willis' bathroom.  All we see in the theatrical release is Bruce returning to his apartment, finding Travolta in there, and then blowing his scientologist @ss away with his own gun.BTW, the fact there are all these ""Kid's Reviews"" of this movie here is disturbing.  And we wonder why Columbines happen..."	3.0	Bring Out the Gimp - Tarantino, that is...	2005-05-04	8	6	2
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A30MC3GLA7U5JB	ADAM M LENHARDT	Overhyped? You bet, especially in late ' 94 when this movie was all the rage. Unfortunately, that may turn off some people who have never seen this movie. One of the best films of the decade, this thing started a wave of ' gritty/cool, pop culture/guns-blood-drugs-sex ' movies, all of whom pale in comparison. Completely, totally entertaining, this movie has quite literally helped to define Generation X. Anyone in 2002 between the ages of approximately 25-43, probably has a soft spot for this movie..Like alot of people, I saw this thing about 5 times in the theatre and it was always a great experience..the audience was electric, caught up in the rush of this movie..and that's something I've rarely felt since, if ever. I'm not going to get in to what this movie is about, because if you've seen it, you certainly know, and if you haven't..I envy you! It's one of those movies I'd love to see again for the first time. Forget the hype, forget the notoriety that this film has, just sit back and experience it..I doubt you will not enjoy it. As for the DVD version..well, they better get a collector's series out soon, because the stripped-down DVD is the one reason I haven't bought it..in fact, my only copy is one that I taped off of pay-per-view in like 1995, so I am eager to once again see it in its widescreen, dolby-digital glory..but I refuse to pay for this lousy... DVD. Come on guys, let's get a real version out there ( 2-disc set? please? ). My advice? rent it..and save your green for the eventual collector-type DVD version.	5.0	Movie Great DVD Not	2002-03-01	3	2	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2S166WSCFIFP5	"adead_poet@hotmail.com ""adead_poet@hotmail.com"""	"Pulp Fiction has often been hailed as one of the greatest films made-certainly one of the best in modern times (along with Fargo, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the Star Wars trilogy). And it is easy to see why. Beside being a great film, it catapulted Tarantino into the public's eye, revived the dead career of John Travolta, introduced us to Tim Roth, reminded us of Harvey Keitel and Ving Rhames, gave us so many catch phrases, and ingrained itself into American pop culture. This is arguably Tarantino's best film (only Reservoir Dogs can compete with it) and after watching it, there is little room for doubt about the greatness of the film. As a film, volumes can be written on it, and I can't say enough of it here.Now, on to the dvd... We've waited 10 years for a special edition. But has it been worth the wait? I think so. It is a 2 disc set, in an attractive slipcover case. Disc 1 contains the movie and an enhanced trivia track. No, there is not a commentary track, but the trivia track fills in (somewhat) nicely. I do wish Tarantino had chosen to include a commentary track. There is also a section called `Soundtrack Chapters.' Anyone who has seen Pulp Fiction (or any Tarantino movie for that matter), knows how important music is to the film. This option allows you to jump to the various music selections in the film. Disc 2 contains deleted scenes, a behind the scenes montage (weak), a documentary (""Pulp Fiction: The Facts""), the Independent Spirit Awards (where Pulp Fiction won), the Palm d'Or Acceptance Speech, a production design featurette, Siskel and Ebert's ""At the Movies"" segment on the `Tarantino generation,' Tarantino's appearance on the Charlie Rose show, as well as trailers, tv spots, stills, and articles and reviews. And it is loaded with dvd-rom extras. The dvd was worth the wait (even without a commentary track), and it is finally nice to see dvd worthy of the film."	5.0	a fine piece of storytelling	2003-01-09	4	1	3

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	ADLVFFE4VBT8	"A. Dent ""Aragorn"""	Pulp Fiction, besides (arguably) being the best Tarantino movie so far,Pulp Fiction (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)was/is one of the best packaged DVDs ever. I didn't hesitate for one second when I noticed that the poorly packaged Blu edition was selling for about eight dollars. I placed the order, the plan being to simply replace the DVD's movie disc with the Blu and get the best of both.It was a gamble because not all Blu re-issues are noticeable improvements over the original DVD releases but this edition of Pulp Fiction is. Very much so. Anyone who's watched the Blu issues of '2001' or the Blu James Bond Collection or The Godfather probably knows what I'm talking about. Its like someone washed the camera's lens and everything that was to be sharp is even more so and all shades are nuances are now perfectly rendered. Add to that the spectacular Loseless DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio soundtrack and, especially at this price, the Blu Pulp Fiction should be a must buy.As for the extra content, this one-disc release carries almost everything (DVD resolution) that the Collector's edition has, minus the DVD-ROM features and adds 2 new featurettes containing more recent interviews with the cast and some critics discussion on the movie's role in the history of cinematography.The presentation is in line with this edition price: done cheaply: cheap looking blue plastic case with cutouts to reduce the costs by a couple of pennies and... nothing else. But, again, my intention was from the beginning to take the Blu disc and place it in the beautiful DVD case.I am happy with my purchase.	5.0	Blu release - significantly improved video, spectacular sound, poor packaging	2011-11-27	5	4	1

This is pure genius and Tarantino pulled out all the stops in his second movie. He beautifully crafted a modern day masterpiece, interweaving multiple story lines and characters. Tarantino is the king of interesting dialogue. In this movie, he shows a side to the crime world we aren't used to seeing. In Pulp Fiction, there are two hitmen sent on a job. In any movie you have seen up til Pulp Fiction, the hitmen are straight-faced, get the job done, and get the heck out with perfect precision. In Pulp Fiction, on the way to a hit, the two gunmen engage in random conversation about the Quarter Pounder and French McDonalds. They then get to the hit too early and have to hang out before they go shoot some people. They kill all but one and take him with them, with no intention on hurting him. However, do to the stupidity of one of the gunmen, the man is shot by accident in the face. To show the genius of Tarantino, he takes this situation which is in any other circumstance would be dead serious, and he makes it funny.This movie is perfect in everyway. Don't even waste your time renting it first. Buy it immediatly. It would be the best decision you have ever made.	5.0	It Doesn't Get Better Than This!	2006-07-27	5	1	4

I can see it over and over again and I always laught.Well I'm not a good movie reviewer, but this one is by far the best Tarantino's movie.There are so many reasons that make this movie a masterpeace that I can't tell them all as I don't want to write a 4 page review.So I resume all in this: I'm sorry if there are famous that already said that, but I like this def. A picture is a masterpeace because you can see it over and over again and there is always something that appear to be new, fresh, you don't get tired in front of it as you always can be looking at details that makes it unique. The same happens in music with Mozart or Bach etc...You see this movie over and over again and there is always something new that you show or notice about it. I think this movie can pass generation over generation and always will cause an effect to it's public. Maybe we can show things that even Tarantino never got in mind as the creator of this masterpeace.just in case: Sorry about my english	5.0	Tarantino's best movie!	2012-04-16	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AKHJQT49F82DJ	"Alejandro Castro ""Hip-Hop Poet"""	So many people claim Chinatown has the greatest screenplay (some even say that honor goes to Good Will Hunting) but the true great is, was, and always will be Pulp Fiction. No film has ever come close to the quirkiness and wit scattered throughout the dialogue in Pulp Fiction.Hitmen that talk about eating p***y and what burgers are called in France, a couple that robs anything and everything and how restaurants are the way to go, and a cab driver thats obsess with how it feels to kill a man. Besides the clever and unique dialogue, the situations these characters get into also ooze creativity (I.E. cleaning a car after a man gets his head blown off, a lady needing an adrenaline shot from ODing, saving LA's most notorious man from a rapist, etc,etc,etc...)In my opinion, Pulp Fiction is a film that goes unparalleled.

A terrible audio presentation that begins and ends on the lowest volume I've experienced on any UMD. Even with the UMD volume set to +2 and on maximum, it's no-where near what it should be. It's trouble with the mastering. It's lacking on both the high ends and low ends. Lacking sharpness in the gushots that usually scare the hell out of me at the start, to the bass and richness of the infamous soundtrack...it lacks all.Score: 1/5Extras:None, zilch, even the terrible menus were ripped straight from the DVD.Score: 1/5Overall:One of my fav films, and one i was looking forward to all month, is below scratch.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A27QGA6O78ISRH	Al Goehring	Wow. Pulp Fiction amazed me in a way I didn't think was possible in a movie of it's kind.John Travolta plays Vincent Vega, a somewhat dimwitted hitman who is works with a fellow hitman, a somewhat smarter assassin named Jules Winfield. They have snappy conversations back and forth, ones just like I have with my brother so often. Bruce Willis is Butch Coolidge, a down on his luck boxer who is on the run from Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), a violent crime boss. Uma Thurman is his wife, Mia, and Harvey Keitel is the problem-solving Winston Wolfe. Christopher Walken has a hilarious cameo as a former POW who delivers a special watch to Butch, and Quentin Tarantino portrays the only non-tough guy in the film, Jimmy, with amazing authenticity.Jackson is thunderingly powerful when he quotes Ezekiel 25.17, and Travolta generates laughter with his bumbling mistakes and volatile attitude. Thurman is oddly sterile in her conversations for reasons I can't figure out, and Rhames always talks annoyingly slowly, but the rest of the actors, expecially Keitel, shine brightly. The redeeming of Jackson's character at the end of Pulp Fiction is almost heart warming.If there is a downside, it is the part of the movie centering around Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames. It is really boring, and is also the most adult part of Pulp Fiction. I wouldn't mind if it was all cut out.The realism in Pulp Fiction is just wonderful. This is a very adult movie, only for the mature. It isn't particularly graphic (at least, the version I saw wasn't) but it has tons of f-word vulgarities. It portrays the underworld with surprising gritty realism.	5.0	An unbeleivably addictive and fun movie!	2001-08-30	0	0	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1BUCV02GV7GVO	Allan Hunter	Yes, this is a gangster film.  Yes, the level of bloodshed and carnage is enough to make the average American housewife run from the theatre in horror.  But this is more than those things.  Underneath a violent veneer  is a very moral movie.  It is a story about a dedication to the human  conscience.  But if morality is one thing you could care less to see in the  movies, then you will surely enjoy the dialogue and interactions between  the film's unique characters.  Enjoy.	5.0	This is not your traditional Pulp.	2000-06-18	1	0	1
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3UVKFCZOL8QTX	Alvin	How could you not like this movie?  If you can sit through the first hour or so (despite a brief kill-scene, this is basically just various characters talking), it becomes a never ending cycle of pop-culture references; borderline random violence; language; awesome, jaw-dropping dialogue; and scenes that shock you, catching you completely off guard.  Characters that you learn to love will be killed in horrible ways, major screw-ups that shouldn't have happened will set whole plot lines in motion.  It's an amazing movie, truly worthy of all of its recognition.	5.0	Greatest Movie ever made	2013-02-26	0	0	0

Tons of quotable lines, mystery, intrigue, action, and a good resolution (for most of the characters).  It is quite violent though, and has lots of language (including the n-word multiple times).  It isn't overbearing, but it does push the line a few times.Samuel L. was awesome, John Travolta was pretty good, Ving Rhames was great.  Umma Thurman was only ok; I liked her better in the Kill Bill movies, but she wasn't terrible.Overall, this is one of the instant classics for me.

Everything about this movie was spot on. The sets, the costumes, the actors, the production, etc. What really set this movie into the stratosphere was the soundtrack. An all-star cast was joined by a phenomenal song selection from a variety of artists from the 1970s and 1980s.Pulp Fiction was criticized by politicians for being too violent but in reality the violence was tame compared to what we see in horror movies all of the time. I'm the 798th person to give this film a Five-Star review and the 1071st overall to rate it. It sas something when 900 people out of 1071 give a film a glowing review. Only 111 people gave it a One or Two star review; and many of those people were complaining about the DVD formats, not the movie itself. This is a film for the ages!I won't go into the multiple conterminous plots. I will, however, discuss something that I really liked about the movie. The streets! Here we have a movie where the characters are either criminals or people on the very edge of society. Marginal, they are the ignored, struggling to make something out of an extremely difficult country. Thus we see why everyone involved is amoral. There are no moral people in Pulp Fiction, only the immoral although mostly they are amoral. I also loved the fact that there were no cops to be found anywhere in this movie! That was innovative and something very rare in Hollywood at the time. Usuually a movie with such violence and gunplay would have had a boy in blue somewhere to be seen sticking his ubiquitous nose where it should not have been. But instead we see these characters from the streets dealing with their problems. No cops, no shrinks, just the streets!Mia Wallace (My Namesake) recounts her years as an actress to Vince Vega in a retro diner. She says the show she was on was called ""Fox Force Five."" That was a take on an actual short-lived TV show of similar plot called ""Code Name Fox Fire."" The two shows as described by Uma Thurman's character are basically the same, save for  a few differences. Tarantino is a master of weaving the past with the present and refining things to such a degree that they are an art form. The man knows his stuff. I next need to by Inglorious Basterds.Buy this movie and you won't be disappointed. There are a quarter score different versions on DVD. I have the Pulp Fiction (Two-Disc Collector's Edition). I have yet to see the disc with the extras, but I do plan to get to it soon and I will also buy the Special Edition of the Soundtrack.A.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	"Few films are as imbedded in our culture as `Pulp Fiction' is.  Even people who have never seen the film (yes, there are a few) know what the film is, have a general idea of what it is about and know the name Quentin Tarantino BECAUSE of this film.  Yes, `Reservoir Dogs' came before it, but nothing really compares to the power and presence (and power OF presence) that Tarantino created for himself with his sophomore hit, `Pulp Fiction'.Now, I've stated since 2009 that Tarantino has one-upped himself.  `Inglourious Basterds' was, in my opinion, Tarantino's crowning achievement and is a film that will be hard to beat.  Still, it may never reach the beloved state that `Pulp Fiction' has earned.  This film will forever be remembered as the birth of a true auteur filmmaker, and man who takes nothing for granted and who gives of himself stylistically as well as substantially with each and every film.Watching `Pulp Fiction', it's easy to see why.With `Pulp Fiction', Tarantino underscored his own love of film with a tapestry film (possibly the BEST tapestry film, in its current format) that weaves through a cascade of characters and delivers a breathtaking and heart racing glimpse at how these lives intersect, interconnect and ultimately combust on the screen.  Because of these connected plots and sub-plots, it's really hard to review or even discuss the film, especially in such a limited setting.  That being said, these characters have become staples, truly memorable pieces of pop culture.  From hitmen Jules and Vincent, to their boss Marsellus to his wife Mia and a boxer, some druggies and a man named Pumpkin (you won't soon forget him either), `Pulp Fiction' cycles these characters in a way that feels complete and rightfully connected.Tarantino's spitfire dialog is insanely inspired and really develops from scene to scene, and the way that the actors handle those words speaks volumes for their talent.  Thurman has never been better, Jackson is top notch entertaining and Bruce Willis is astonishingly complex as the boxer who turns his back on a deal and winds up on the run for his life.""Zed's dead baby..."""	5.0	The simple fact remains; this film is a masterpiece!	2013-09-26	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2I17T9XB6LSGW	Andrew McCaffrey	PULP FICTION is one of those movies that can't help just oozing with coolness.  Back in the mid-90s this film was synonymous with hip and brought John Travolta's career back from the dead.  For years after the release of this picture it was impossible to go into a fast food restaurant without some joker massacring the film's dialogue at you.For all of its influence, it's still one of the most entertaining films to come out of the 90's.  The action frequently slows down enough for the actors to rapidly fire off one-liners at each other, but those never slow down.  These talking scenes are the real meat and potatoes of the film; everything else is just padding to bring us from conversation to conversation.  The characters are almost uniformly excellent, with only one or two exceptions.  Harvey Keitel nearly steals the entire movie in his smallish role as the wonderfully unrealistic Mr. Wolf.The DVD is nice to look at but contains very little in the way of extras.  This is strange, as it does not contain the extra, cut scenes that are featured at the end of the wide-screen video release.  Still it's worth it to have this film on the clearer, longer-lasting format, and for that reason alone this is a great DVD to own.  Stick this into your player and sit back to experience one hell of a fun ride.	4.0	A lot of fun	2001-07-20	4	3	1
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	"Well, I've finally seen Pulp Fiction.  After weeks of being asked to see it by a friend of mine, I finally sat down and watched it.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the movie, although I'm not sure how anyone can watch this more than once.There really isn't ""a"" story; it's more about a group of people who's lives intersect through a mob boss named Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) in four short stories.  While most of the characters overlap into different stories, there is usually one or two core characters in each tale.  One of the stories is about two robbers (played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) who plan on holding up a diner.  John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson play hit men working for Wallace who screw up a job.  Later, Travolta's character Vincent Vega (brother of Michael Madsen's Vic Vega in Resevoir Dogs) has to take out Wallace's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) when Wallace is out of town.  Then, there is a bit about Bruce Willis as Butch Coolidge, a down-and-out boxer who is going to take a fall in his last fight.The way the stories are told is done very well; things are not completely chronologically, which leads viewers to wonder how different characters got into certain situations.Now, about what I was saying earlier.  This is a really good movie, but its replay value is severely limited.  This is definitely a movie that can only be fully enjoyed once by most people (people who are die-hard Tarantino fans will probably be the ones doing multiple viewings).  But don't let that comment stop you from checking it out at least once, as you'd be doing yourself a disservice."	4.0	Good, Yet Little Replay Value	2005-03-21	3	1	2

They don't want you to watch it because they are scared it will corrupt you.  The thing about it is this:  by the time I walked into the mess that was going on, there were things in this movie that I needed to know.  That does not mean that everything I did was right.  I do not claim this.  What I do think is that some folk had some of what happened to them coming to them.  It does not make violent acts right, but this situation is really screwed up.  That is why people need to come forward to the police and federalis more.  Yea, I know they're crooked, but faith and some honesty can really screw wicked men's plans up.  Samuel L.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z	Annie Van Auken	"PLEASE DON'T READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU HAVEN'T YET SEEN THE MOVIE!PULP FICTION (1994) is an intentionally fragmented religious allegory.The movie starts in the story's middle, just after its most crucial scene has occurred. The ending reveals this moment: the conversion of a bad man into a true prophet of God and not a false one who liked quoting Biblical verse before killing his mark, also the doom of this converted man's partner, a non-believer who continues on an evil path until he's struck down.You may remember early on that John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are shot at from close range and the bullets seemingly pass through them without harm. Jackson correctly recognizes this as both Divine intervention and a message that if he doen't change his ways he will surely die. In the diner, Travolta dismisses this as bunk, goes on to try and ""hit"" Bruce Willis, a boxer who was supposed to take a dive but didn't, and ends up dead when Willis uses Travolta's own automatic weapon to shoot him down.If I were to put the film in correct order it would be:Travolta's and Jackson's recovery of a briefcase filled with who knows what, the early morning murder of two men who had the case and the miracle.The accidental killing of the third man in Jackson's car.The scene at Tarantino's house with ""fixer"" Harvey Keitel.Jackson's revelation in the diner about becoming a righteous wanderer and Travolta's rejection of the miracle message, an act that seals his doom.The diner being robbed by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, with Jackson now demonstrating his newfound holiness: he lets them both live.Travolta's non-date with Uma Thurman that almost ends in her OD death.During this same evening, Bruce Willis wins a fight he's ordered to lose, then tries to escape the wrath of mob boss Ving Rhames.The next morning, Willis goes to his apartment where he recovers his wristwatch and kills Travolta.Immediately after, Willis encounters Rhames on the street; the two of them end up prisoners at a s&aacute;distic p&egrave;rv's gunshop.Their narrow escape from death here is the story's actual end. There's a grudging truce between Willis and Rhames, but Willis must leave town. Jackson has gone off to be a prophet, Travolta is dead..Supporting cast includes: Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Kathy Griffin, Julia Sweeney and the film's producer, Lawrence Bender.Trivia:At the 1950s retro burger joint, Buddy Holly is played by Steve Buscemi."	5.0	"Jules: ""And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee."""	2010-12-17	1	1	0

Upon opening you will find a soundtrack cd which is barely held in by a cheap plastic molding. Not only that, but the soundtrack is nothing but an 18 minute ""sampler"", featuring only 6 songs! This is NOT the same soundtrack (2 cds) which was recently reissued to coincide with the dvd rerelease. There are no descriptions of the special features in the accompanying booklet; the tray which holds the 2 dvds (on a single spindle, making them susceptible to popping out loose and getting scratched) easily falls out of the box.

An all-star cast of John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Bruce Willis that each play to their best.  Samuel L. Jackson has some of the best lines in this movie, including his Ezekial speech.  This movie clinches Jackson's title as &quot;Coolest Man on Earth&quot;.  Christopher Walken, for as little as he is in this movie, delivers one of the most hilarious monologues I have ever heard.  Tarantino's attention to detail is at its best here and the pop culture references are abundant.  As far as the violence factor, most of it is inferred or it happens of camera.  Some of the violence is also diffused by some comedy immediately following.  The intermingling of the stories bookended by the restaurant scene really keeps the movie together.  Tarantino will have a tough time topping this film.	5.0	Greatest Movie since the Godfather	2004-02-23	3	1	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1534MBU6VJXYN	"Anthony Nasti ""Tony"""	"Quentin Tarrentino is truly great. At a time when movies weere starting to become formulaic and unoriginal, Tarrentino all of a sudden burst on the scene with 1992's ""Resevoir Dogs"", a sprawling, intensely violent crime drama that was the most groundbreaking and original movie to come out in years. Next came ""True Romance"". Though Tony Scott directed it, the film would not have worked without Tarrentino's excellent screenplay, which featured some of the best dialogue ever commited to film in addition to some bitingly funny humor and nonstop action. Those first two films were excellent, but nothing could prepare Hollywood for tarretino's next film. ""Pulp Fiction"" was indeed a unique movie: rather than have a plot revolving a central character or characters, ""Pulp Fiction"" was four films in one. In addition, Tarrentino loaded the cast with A-listers that normally wouldn't take a role in one of Tarrentino's independent based films, then again, when you have a project like this thrown in your face, how could you refuse?Well, ""Pulp Fiction"" turned out to be a smash with both critics and audiences around the world. First, it won the Palm d'or (a foreign film award) as best pciture, than it won over critics around the world with its unique storytelling and excellent cast. Finally, the $ 8 million movie grossed over $ 100 million at the box office, got Tarrentino an Oscart for best screenplay, and rescued the careers of former Hollywood heavyweights John Travolta (who received an Oscar nomination) and Bruce Willis (whou should have received an Oscar nomination).""Pulp Fiction"", as I said earlier, is essentially four films in one. One deals with two hitmen, Vincent Vega (Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson, who chews the scenery like a steak every chance he gets). Vincent and Jules make small talk about religion, animals and McDonald's in Paris and Amsterdam. Meanwhile, down on his luck boxer Butch Coolidge (Willis) has been ordered by crime boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) to throw a fight while Vega take his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) on a date, which leads to a dance-off and disaster. Next thing you know, Coolidge wins the fight, kills Vega, and him and Marcellus are held hostage in a weapons shop (the best scene in the film). The last sequence involves Winston Wolf (Harvey Keitel) helping Jules and Vega (in case you're wondering, this film is not in chronological order) disposing of a body with the help of Jimmy (Tarrentino himself). To cap things off is a showdown at a local dinner between Jules and Vincent and two crime loving lovers (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer).A little confusing, hah? Well, if the plot is a little too much to handle, than you should just watch it for the wonderful cast assembled for it. Some members (Travolta, Willis, Jackson, Thurman, Rhames) are focal points who dominate the film, while others (Christopher Walken, Rosanna Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Plummer, Roth, Keitel, Maria De Medeiros) hardly appear at all. The point is, when they're onscreen, they command it. If this film had thrown Nicholson, Pacino and De Niro into the mix, than I'd consider it the rgeatest cast of actors assembled for any film. If ""Pulp Fiction"" had nothing else going for it, the cast would still shine through with their wondeful performances.However, ""Pulp Fiction"" has a lot going for it. It is perfect. And this special edition two disc dvd just adds to that perfrction. The extras are outstanding. One of the best se's ever. However, even if this film had no extras, it would still be worth it for the film alone."	5.0	"""Do You Know What A Devine Intervention Means?"""	2005-08-30	4	1	3

I think the best things of this movie are Sam J and John T just talking. If the whole movie was just the two of them talking in character, then I would rate it 4 and a half stars for the dialogue. Quentin Tarantino's talking was comedic to me than it was probably supposed to be. You can definitely see the comedy context in the movie, so I thought that was clever mixing with the darker context. It was a little strange seeing Uma looking the way she did compared to Kill Bill (personally my favorite QT movie). I guess I'd recommend since its such a well known movie...but if you don't like most of Tarantino's work then you might not like this film.	3.0	Hmm...The Dialogue Is Best	2005-06-29	6	3	3

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1QSNRNP6WL5XU	ARAJAGOPAL	My favourite movie of all time.  Quentin Tarantino has reminded us what a powerful art medium the celluloid could be by making a bold, chronologically ripped movie which mesmerises you with its characters,  dialogue and music.  The story is about Ving Rhames and his hit men, wife  and sundry other partners-in-crime.  The film though is not for all tastes  - I have not met a person who 'just liked it'; they either love it (the  lucky ones) or hate it (have mercy on their souls). The dialogues are sharp  and witty and every character is perfectly cast.What do they call a  quarter pounder with cheese in Paris?

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E	"Archie Mercer ""Archie"""	"Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of the most addictive movies I have ever watch. The acting is great. The plot, while being a little strange, is intriguing. And the sequence of the film, starting in the middle of the story, going back to the beginning, reaching the end (with a flashback thrown in) and then arriving back at the middle for the final scene in the movie was unique and inventive. It's also interesting to note that Tarantino tried the same concept with hisKill Bill, Volume 1&Kill Bill, Volume 2films but with mixed results. It just wasn't original any more and became somewhat annoying at times.The problem that keeps me from rating this movie a ""5"" is that it's also a very sloppy movie. I understand that being a relatively low budget ""Indie"" flick will have it's drawbacks but no movie I have ever watched has had as many goofs & bloopers left in as Pulp Fiction. These include:* Seeing the reflections of camera operators in windows* Seeing the shadows of the booms & cameras in many scenes* Many Continuity's issues, like the magically moving ketchup bottle that roams all over the table at Jack Rabbit Slims* And my favorite: When Jules and Vincent are in the car discussing the ""Royale with cheese"" you can see the reflection of their vehicle being towed on a trailer.All movies have a few instances like these but one website has tracked over 50 mistakes. Does this make Pulp Fiction a bad film? Of course not. In fact, once you know how sloppy it is it's actually quite fun to see how many goofs you can pick out. But I would hope, and expect, a much smaller list of screw-ups for any released film, even a low budget independent one.But all that being said, this is a great film. I can only imagine the cast, including John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth,& Ving Rhames, to name a few, must have had a blast making it. A truly intoxicating film!"	4.0	A Great, Great Film, but............	2007-12-28	9	7	2
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	ADUFO9YYBBXTU	Ariel A. Rodriguez	"Everyone who's ever heard of Pulp Fiction knows that it's one of the greatest films ever made (I've never heard it discussed in any context stating less).  But not everyone is sure why.  I'll explain:Pulp Fiction is an excercise in storytelling via film.  It shows rather than tells.  This is first illustrated in the opening scene where Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are talking.  There is no character devlopment, rather we simply see them in full character swing and come to know them that way, like we do with our own friends.  The casual use of profanity helps this notion as well.  The three stories that come thereafter each follow a pattern, each one using the profane language effectively:""Vincent Vega & Marsellius Wallace's Wife"" - when does the excessive profanity start here?  When Uma Thurman OD's, which is exactly when the conflict of the story starts.  This story had the weakest redemption, in which John Travolta brings her back by injection and the two come to a mutual understanding not to talk about the night.""The Gold Watch"" - the excessive profanity/conflict starts when Bruce Willis realizes his watch is missing.  The redemption here is most obvious, that he decides to save Ving Rhames, the boss he double-crossed.  Once more, they develop a mutual understanding.""The Bonnie Situation"" - my favorite of the stories.  The excessive profanity/conflict begins when Marvin is shot.  Again, the story ends with a mutual understanding between Sam Jackson and Tim Roth.  The redemption theme is highly obvious in both Jackson's speech and in his decision to quit the life opposite Travolta's decision to stay (which is ironic as we all know how he will die)There is so much genius to Pulp Fiction, most of it exerted in making it so enjoyable."	5.0	Why this is a Good Film...	2002-07-31	8	6	2

In many ways, it doesn't matter; he has made a masterpiece here.  Quentin's films are always a subtle balance of the disturbing and the great.  This film is almost as disturbing as it is amazing.  Here as in his other films, music is an important element.  The music is inspired and compliments the action on the screen, of which there is much.  John Travolta has never been better than he is here as a burned-out hit man.  Bruce Willis as the washed-up boxer is at his best, without a doubt.  The only problem I have with this film is the character of ""Esmeralda Villalobos,"" the Colombian taxi driver who gets Willis out of harm's way after he kills a man in a fight.  Villalobos has a Russian accent and is supposed to be Colombian.  I don't know if Tarantino was just confused about accents or what.  That said, it was a small detail and doesn't affect the overall tenor of the movie.  I would highly recommend it to anyone 21 years old or over.

I definitly think this movie is worth seeing and owning. The first time I saw it, and only saw about half of it, but I still love it. Another great thing about this movie is the jumpiness of it.

Pretty much everything about Pulp Fiction defines the word ""awesome."" It's a roller coaster of a ride for me. At first, it can be quiet and straightforward. Then, suddenly the momentum is pumped up so high that a single incident rolled onto a fury of speed in an energetic form before it calms down. The performances, those who gave the best of the best were: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Rosanna Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Amanda Plummer, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, and Ving Rhames. I personally think John Travolta and Uma Thurman are the most outstanding with Samuel L. Jackson and Eric Stoltz a close second behind. Three of the best scenes are: the stab onto Uma's heart, the bible quote by Samuel L. Jackson, and the reminiscence of Saturday Night Fever with John Travolta, especially when he does the V sign across his face. It's a very exhilarating moment when John Travolta does that. Anytime Pulp Fiction is mentioned, too often this dance is imitated to convey the feeling of what they remember the best about Pulp Fiction. Oh yeah, what a ride. Pulp Fiction is the most explosive film of the 1994 and completely changed the standards of how new movies are thought to adhere by. Of course, Pulp Fiction contains profanity, violence, rape, bizarre situations, drugs, and more profanity, but one thing that is undeniable about Pulp Fiction: it's a work of art. It's a film buff's paradise. It's an everyday man's delight. Pulp Fiction is a culturally significant flick, and it's purely American. After twelve years, Pulp Fiction has repeatedly passed the test of time and remains fresher than ever. Another reason why Pulp Fiction is thoroughly a masterpiece is because no one, I mean no one, can duplicate the feel that it has created since then. Absolutely there is no motion picture that has the stroke of genius in conjuring up the trashiness found in Pulp Fiction and making itself a masterpiece out of it. Yes, Quentin Tarantino establishes himself a master of stealing stuff from other films but did anyone do it well as he? All in all, Pulp Fiction is a film that is regarded to be in a class of its own.6/11: Deciding to drop its rating from `10' to `9', I feel Pulp Fiction is a bit overrated flick. Sure, it has its famous moments and brand of conversational style which we label it as Tarantinoesque. Since 1994, many films have tried to copy and imitate Pulp Fiction and have painfully failed in a corny way. And since then, there hasn't been a film like it with a possible exception of Snatch which was wonderfully directed by Guy Ritchie. Rewatching Pulp Fiction, I feel the dialogues are losing its appeal and are becoming a bit stale. Even worse, the shock value, especially during the outrageous moments, is appearing to be done in poor taste; it's just gang related beef, sodomy, violence, and popcorn junk. What I am drawn to the film is the performances by John Travolta and Samuel Jackson, but now, I feel Samuel had his own 15 minutes of fame and hadn't been relevant over the years. John is still brilliant in Pulp Fiction; he really steals the film, but I have to say, his legacy remains in Saturday Night Fever. That's the most I can say for Pulp Fiction excluding for the memorable moments, mostly from the scenes with John and Uma Thurman. It doesn't help matters any that Quentin Tarantino has become an inferior director over the years and has never been the same since. All in all, Pulp Fiction is losing its timeless quality and is almost bordering on ridiculous."	5.0	Great Film but Is Losing Against Test of Time.	2011-06-12	24	2	22

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2XX6RRHTQ9TTR	Balisani	It can be reasonably said there are two 20th century cinematographic masterpieces: Citizen Kane and Pulp Fiction.  Quentin Tarentino wrote, and intertwined, three stories, with characters in common.  He revolutionized film making by dispensing with the pretense of time: the movie ends with the second middle part, starts with the first middle part, and everything else in between is, well, not exactly in chronological sequence either, but this gives it great momentum and contributes to building excitement and anticipation of the next scene(s).  The second sequence that introduces John Travolta and Samuel Jackson to the audience is groundbreaking: there is no cut in continuity (there are visual cuts of course, but the dialogue is uninterrupted, much as you and a friend would start a conversation in a car, continue up the steps, in the lobby, in the elevator, down the corridor, and in front of a door).  To my recollection this was the first such occurrence in the history of cinema, but such was not the only innovation: the entire movie is bursting at the seams with Tarentino's talent and encyclopaedic knowledge.  All the actors are amazing, including Tarentino, who, while not a great actor, delivers here a very convincing performance (with just the right amount of nuance). I could go on and on. Don't trust me: check out the 20th anniversary article in Vanity Fair, or google it and inform and see it for yourself!	5.0	20th Century Masterpiece	2013-04-04	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AY7P9BVGV4347	Benjamin Ellsworth	Quentin Tarantino has shown time and time again what's missing in our &quot;special effect&quot; happy movies of now. What makes his movies special surely isn't the effects... Tarantino gets it done like the classics of old.One: Dialogue. Interaction of characters by using everyday small talk, believable attitudes, and great sequences of emotions experienced by the characters.Two: Plots and Settings. Coffee shops, pawn shops, warehouses, and apartments. Everyday places.Three (to me, the secret weapon): Soundtrack. Most of these songs are either past hits, or old songs made into hits by Tarantino's movies. Most of his songs chosen before the script is started.And last, but certainly not least Four: Choice of actors. Who would ever have imagined Eric Stoltz as a heroine dealer or John &quot;Disco&quot; Travolta as a &quot;heroine user/hitman?&quot;Tarantino combined Samuel L. Jackson, who at the time was little known, and another actor John Travolta, who I will forever see as &quot;Vinny Barbarino&quot;, and created some of the best in-movie conversations ever. I want to order a &quot;Royale with cheese&quot; at McDonalds every time I go. I like giving foot messages now, but ONLY to women. And I now know why...Both actors' careers skyrocketed after the movie's release. Bruce Willis shows an outstanding performance as a has-been boxer who steals an opportunity set in his path. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer also chip-in with some great scenes as armed robbers. Every scene is some crazy scenario with a handful of on-point actors, who pull you in with the greatest of ease.I could go on and on about this movie and others (Resevior Dogs, Four Rooms, Jackie Brown, and Natural Born Killers, for example, but a purchase of Pulp Fiction is sure to start any &quot;REAL&quot; movie lover off to a long relationship with Quentin Tarantino and his &quot;Masterful Creations.&quot;	5.0	Instant Classic by 'the' movie genius of our era.	2003-08-06	0	0	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AT54Q2ERA4PBR	Ben J Korgen	Watching this film about two relaxed and matter-of-fact hit men named Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is likely to be a confusing experience, but one that becomes rewarding for those patient enough to learn why Quentin Tarantino's efforts to make it an outrageously violent and hilarious success won for him an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.  Confusion comes from superimposing forward and backward time shifts on the events that take place within three different plots.  Some viewers might be annoyed when they see likeable hit man Vincent Vega brutally murdered, then alive and well later in the movie.  Events like this are not accidents.  They come together in a surprise ending that would not be a surprise if viewers knew exactly what was going on throughout this unusual and memorable film.  It cannot be described well in words and must be seen to be believed.	5.0	Quentin Tarantino Directs John Travolta And Jules Winnfield In Violent, Twist & Turn, Hilareous Gem	2013-11-01	1	1	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A64DU3GWFNAU7	"Beth ""The Best Person Ever"""	"After only one film, 1992's breakout success Reservoir Dogs, director/screenwriter/actor Quentin Tarantino made a name for himself, and with that name is associated a certain filmmaking style.  Pulp Fiction (1994) reinforces his signature style: it is a blood-soaked, fast-talking, pop culture-savvy fusion of three interwoven stories, each a take-off on a clich&eacute; situation everyone has read before in the pulps.For stories that are supposed to be low-brow stereotypes, the movie comprised of them was a big success.  The impressive cast plays off each other extremely well, the dialogue snaps, and, of course, the guns fire all the way through this movie.  Pulp Fiction won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and as a relatively low budget film, grossed much more for Miramax than it took to make.The stories are tried and truisms that have been around since the dawn of time: a hitman is asked to take out the boss's wife, but he'd better not touch her; a boxer is supposed to throw a fight, but doesn't; a pair of robbers stage their next job on the wrong day.  The crucial difference, however, is that Tarantino revives these played-to-death characters by making them human.  He shows what they do with the rest of their days, what they talk about, and puts them in normal situations.  John Travolta's and Samuel L. Jackson's characters, Vincent and Jules, ruthlessly kill any man their boss pays them to, but the audience can't help but see them as lovable when they talk about foot massages and what burgers are called in Paris.  Bruce Willis's character, Butch, the past-his-prime boxer, is a tough-as-nails badass to anyone he comes across, but then playfully calls his little French girlfriend ""lemon pie.""  Tarantino himself plays a character, Jimmy, Jules's sometimes-partner, who is not at all phased by the nearly-headless corpse Jules and Vincent bring to his house, they'd just better get it out of his garage before his wife comes home.By putting each of these other-worldly characters in typical, everyday situations, Tarantino lets the audience consider them as human, and therefore able to be identified with.  All the characters also have a distinct level of decency and dignity, despite their language.  For instance, when Butch escapes his restraints and the pawnshop, he could have just left Marsellus to his fate; however, he knows no man deserves what Marsellus was suffering, so Butch risked his life to go back and save the man who, minutes earlier, had been trying to kill him.  Likewise, after Marsellus is rescued by Butch, he lifts the price from his head.  Also, Jules sincerely feels he has felt divine intervention, so instead of blowing away the robber Ringo in the diner, he tries to be the shepherd he believes God wants him to be and lets ""Pumpkin"" leave with his girl.As for the special ""collectors' edition"" DVD, it's definitely worth it.  The deleted scenes are just as great as the ones that made the cut, the interviews with Tarantino are priceless (no matter how goofy-annoying he may be), and it even comes with a menu for Jack Rabbit Slim's!Within the three overlapping, interlocking stories of this movie, a playful energy courses throughout.  The actors deliver their lines with a tongue-in-cheek banter full of little jokes and pop culture references.  With its big-name stars and sharp dialogue making the film, Pulp Fiction is an amazing movie, and is quintessential Quentin."	5.0	The Facts About Pulp Fiction	2005-04-10	4	3	1

I for one do not generally fall into the whole ""star-power to sell a movie"" trap, but this movie definetly backs up the stars with a unique set of sub-plots.

This film is loaded with everything from great performances to great music. I liked the fact Tarantino infused real people into the story and showed conscequences for their actions. Drug abuse, murders, and everyday actions show conscequences. Everyone scrutinizes this movie because of so-called graphic violence and showing of drugs as cool. But in reality, the film shows how these things are bad. murders are shown offscreen and drugs are used only in the beginning of the movie. The film includes great dialogue though. i like the way the story moves along on dialogue, but it's not the boring stuff you hate. Just the stupied things the characters talk about is in a way interesting because you don't know who they are.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AREYMJ0BWVIAE	Bill	"""Butch, what does that mean?""""This is America baby, our names don't mean...""This quote is one of many remembered in the Quentin Tarantino classic. Using a fantasicly amazing blend of modern urban-suburbian style with classic film noir style, the movie has a feel like none other I have ever seen. Wearing black suites with white shirts and thin black ties, Vicent Vega (John Travolta)and Jules Winfield (Saumel L.Jackson) are half-cent hitmen hired to kill a guy by their boss Marcelles Wallace (Ving Rhames).Using a suberb rotating plot that can only work in a movie like this, it jumps around from a diner scene staring Honey Bunny (Amanda Plumber) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth). Like Kenneth Branagh is to Shakespeare, Tim Roth is to Tarantino. Only he can transform into one of his characters.Later on, Vega has to keep his bosses wife company while he is out of town. The wife, Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) is a drug addicted, hipster hottie who ends up getting Vega into alot of trouble.The troubled boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willace) finds himself on the run from Mr.Wallace after he kills a man in the ring. Probably my favorite part of the movie, it ends in the basement of a pawn-shop, with a sword and and a perverted cop named Zed.The best movie of the 1990's, Pulp Fiction is imortalized by its sick, hip, scarey, funny, emotional, and realistic themes. I know people who say that it is evil, but I beg to differ. Didn't people say that Mark Twain was evil in the 1800's?"	5.0	In my top 5 movies of all time.	2002-04-16	6	5	1
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1PT528VO1Y5CM	BILL	This has to be one of the most overrated films in history. I believe that most people who said that they liked this piece of garbage only did so because they wanted to sound hip and cool. Many did not see Tarintino's  previous films but were told how hip and cool these films were and so by the time Pulp Fiction was released they went to see it so that they could &quot;jump on the bandwagon&quot;. Tarintino is trying to make mindless violence &quot;trendy&quot;. There is no real plot to this picture and the characters are all obnoxious. It seems that for a film to be considered a masterpiece nowadays, it must contain weird situations and violent obnoxious characters.

Video is great, sound is great, features are lacking. Aside from the movie, there's not much to play with. I  realize that a lot of studios want to get their bigger movies on DVD, but a commentary from Tarantino and a few members of the cast would have been divine. Go to sum up, great movie, great cast, great video/audio, no features.

From the opening dialogue between Pumpkin and Honeybunny, this film taught us a different way of watching film; instead of looking for the explosions and kills, we started listening to watch those thugs and assassins had to say. I know some say that ""Reservoir Dogs"" is the better film, but I think that's nonsense.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1GMVDZNU3N5HX	B. Reifman	There is very little that you can find wrong in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Everything from the acting to the dialogue to the cinematics makes &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; one of the greatest films, if not the greatest film, of the '90s and in Hollywood history. It set the standard for what a great movie is, among the many realeases of senseless, one-lined and &quot;big-budget action&quot; flicks that are now found in theaters every other week.Each of the three stories told is a movie on their own, all having some of the best scenes and dialogue ever incorporated into a movie. Even though the movie as a whole might take a while to explain, there's no complex theory or great desperation to make it into an artsy flick. Just pure moviemaking at its best.Mentioning the acting, Samuel L. Jackson has established himself as the greatest badass of all time. This is proven in the apartment scene at the beginning of the movie. Truly a memorable scene in movie history.If you consider yourself a movie buff, but haven't seen &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, stop kidding yourself. Go rent yourself &quot;XXX&quot; or any other mindless flick and miss out on one of the greatest, if not the greatest, movies ever.	5.0	A movie in its purest form	2003-04-15	2	1	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AWQSHRGVWKGXY	brent	Pulp Fiction, although one of the most imitated movies on it's time, is the real deal.  It is exciting, funny, and original.  Tarantino follows &quot;Resevior Dogs&quot; with this innovative film.  The film is divided up into three stories, and a prologue.  The stories are all interrealted and very entertaining.  The stories are about two hit men, a boxer and his girlfriend, the hit men's boss and his wife and two very funny robbers.What is so clever about this film is that it isn't moved along by the action.  There are plenty of action scenes and violent seens in the film, but what keeps the film interesting was what would have been cut by a big time producer.  Tarantino's independent approach to the movie helped it maintain its originality.  The movie is fueled by dialogue.  In one scene, the two hit men delay arriving at their tagets place by discussing hamburgers (Ryale with Cheese) and foot massages.  It has it's share of other funny lines (&quot;Zed's dead baby, Zed's dead.&quot;)I loved this movie, and it is in my top five.  It is outrageously original and strikingly funny.  It is the perfect film of the 90's.	5.0	I wish I could give it more than five stars!	2002-08-25	3	2	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2ZHDCYYP1PL2K	"brewster22 ""brewster22"""	What more is there to say about &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot;  Released in 1994, the film was an adrenaline shot to the heart of the film industry.  Though the movie payed homage to a variety of film genres and styles (film noir, gangster film, French New Wave), it managed to be unlike anything seen before.  Whether you love &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; or hate it (and I, for one, love it) you can't deny the impact it had on filmmaking moving forward into the 21st Century.  While watching &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; for the first time, I knew sitting there in the theatre that I was seeing something that would immediately influence movies forever, and it has.I won't bother to summarize the plot, since plot in this movie is only of incidental importance anyway.  I won't bother to single out individual performances, since the performances are uniformly excellent.  I will save my praise for Quentin Tarantino's audacious attempts to show us something original, daring and experimental and for giving us a welcome break from the stale products Hollywood studios have been churning out for years.If you're one of the handful of people in the world who haven't yet seen this film, run out and see it now.  I can't guarantee you'll like it, but I can guarantee that you'll have a definite opinion about it, and even that is refreshing these days.Grade: A	5.0	Where to Begin?	2003-08-11	2	1	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A14LIZKKA7WYT9	brigsbmc@cs.com	Quentin Tarantino's amazing movie which he wrote and directed as well as played a cameo role in,  is one of the best movies ever made.  I mean it!  The film feels like it was written and directed in a white HEAT,  showing how truly great a talent Tarantino really is.  Peppered with outrageous humor,  characters,  and situations,  PULP FICTION is a masterpiece.  The movie revolves around several characters whose own personal stories finally interweave with each other.  John Travolta is unbelievable as Vincent Vega! Superbly played,  he can be despised and loved at the same time.  Equally incredible is Sameul L.  Jackson's performance.  In one mesmerizing scene where he is pointing a gun at a guy who has messed with the wrong man, he recites a passage from the Bible,  the camera never leaving his face and his eyes never blinking.  I nearly fell out of my seat! Uma Thurman is great as the beautiful but drug-addicted wife to Marcellus Wallace(Brilliantly played by Ving Rhames).  One of the best performances in the entire movie is that of Bruce Willis,  who finally shows that he is truly much more than just an action star.  Harvey Keitel astounds as The Wolf,  the man you call when you've got a problem.  Although he only has a few minutes on screen,  he is awesome.  Christopher Walken provides a wonderful cameo in which he explains to a younger version of Bruce Willis the way his father died.  Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth make a dynamic duo as bank robbers,  and Maria de Medeiros is very effective as Fabienne,  Willis's girlfriend.  Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette are very good in their small but important roles,  as well as Steve Buscemi in his very small and unrecognizable role as the Buddy Holly waiter.  Tarantino won an Oscar for his screenplay,  and he definitely deserved it.  Go out and rent it or buy it.  Worth it!	5.0	Simply Incredible!	2001-04-04	2	1	1

This is Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino's undisputed masterpiece. Simply put, a genius rollercoast ride from beginning to end. With a large list of stars, including Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Christopher Walken, Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman in some of their greatest performances to date.The movie is broken up into three stories, all revolving around two hitmen (Jackson, Travolta), a mob boss's wife (Thurman), a boxer planing on retiring (Willis), and a mysterious breifcase, this fast paced film is probably one of the greatest action films EVER. The dialogue is what you would expect from Tarantino, with plenty of funny but memorable lines that you will remember forever.With a die-hard cast, a chaotic but focused storyline, and an unbelievable soundtrack, including the classic ""Miserlou"" by Dick Dale and the Del-Tones, this film is definately Tarantino's funniest, most violent, and most fun romp to date, and one of the top ten greatest films ever!

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2PSB6TTB33M5L	"Bruce Campbell ""destroyer_of_false_metal"""	"I was reading some of the reviews on here for this amazing movie, an equal number of good and bad, and I'd have to say the majority of the reviews missed the point. Most of them rambled on about all the characters and the story, which was not necessary. Now, either you are one of those people who pretend to be cool and hip and pretend like you know what's going on, but i reality you're lost soul seeking attention. Either that or your just completely ignorant. The people who gave it bad reviews complained about it being boring or whatever, and that's where i come in.This movie is not for everybody. It's long and there's a lot of dialouge. So for the impatient movie-goer who needs explosions and fighting in order to keep your attention, go watch ""I,Robot"" or ""AVP"" or something. This movie is about great dialouge and a combination of several styles of moviemaking, and that's what Tarantino does (and does very well), so if you don't like it, don't watch his movies. The movie is not about a bunch of characters who are all connected some how, it's a story about redemption among criminals.Each character is set up and you watch as they met their end, an end that is appropiate for them. Each story has some revelavence, showing that even in the minds of these evil men they still posses the morality of a person who is good, I saw someone mention how Uma Thurman's role in the movie seemed pointless, which is exactly what I was talking about. Vic (Travolta) starts to falls in love with Mia (Thurman) but because he is LOYAL to Marsellus (Rhames) he controls himself. He is a druged up criminal with no care at all for life, but yet he still respects Marsellus as his boss and will not do anything to upset him. I mean come on, did you hear what he said in the bathroom?The same applies to Butch (Willis) and Marsellus (Rhames). They hate each other and Marsellus is out to kill Butch since he crossed him, but despite that, Butch saves Marsellus from Zed and then Marsellus lets him go. The two are cold blooded criminals, but still have that sense of morality. It's not right for Marsellus to get raped by some rapist redneck and so Butch saves him and then Marsellus lets him go. They realize what the right thing to do is, no matter how much they hate each other.If you still don't get the point, just lok at Jules (Jackson) at the end in the resturant. He thinks he experinced ""Divine Intervention"" and now he's a changed man. When he sits Pumpkin/Ringo (Roth) down and tells him, ""But I'm trying Ringo. I'm trying real hard to be the shepard"" it shows that, even though his job is to kill people he thinks God is still watching out for him. He goes on to quit his job and live his life the way he thinks is right. Redemption.In summary, the point is: Even in criminals, who seem completely heartless, there is that morality, and that they do care about other people. That's it morality, redemeption, and respect among those who are ""evil"". Take it or leave it, i just think a movie this perfect should get more respect then it has been."	5.0	I think you missed the point.	2005-04-01	9	7	2

I could name a thousand movies that are more violent than this.  Second, this is a very religous and spiritual movie. The main theme of the movie is redemption. The purpose of this movie is to show that everyone is capable of redemption, whether they are killers, drug dealers, etc. They are normal people just like you and me, even though their professions are questionable. I realize that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and that they can put this movie down for it's violence and profanity; but whatever you do, don't call it distasteful.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AKV2BGUT50B1X	Carl Robinson	Pulp Fiction is the Magnum opus of film-maker Quentin Tarantino.  It is a film that is centered upon the lives of criminals, dope dealers, sadists, and other colorful characters.  The movie is rich with detail, with references tomarijuana culture among other things.This movie is filmed in the hum-drum early 90's style of Los Angeles.  The characters go to working class diners, working class apartments, and buy drugs in a modest house.  Only the top gangster's house is sheik. Through these settings dialogue is maximized, where every emotion is expressed in colorful, but vulgar terms in several different but interesting and novel ways.There are many reviews on this movie, it is perhaps one of the greatest films ever produced-easily the best film of the 1990's decade.  What then makes this movie so powerful?  There are many reviews about this film, there is also an equal number of speculative meanings.  Perhaps this ambiguity, or multiple layers of meanings is what makes the film so powerful.If there is a central theme it is atonement.  The three major characters, Butch, Vincent, & Jules each have an experience where they can alter what they are doing and thereby seek out the transcendent and honorable.  Butch and Jules both do so, Vincent does not and he is killed by his own gun, his body left hunched on a toilet.The rest of Tarantino's movies lurch from wordy, snore fests, to wordy, cruel slasher films.  This film is his greatest work.  It is not only above Quentin Tarantino's normal fare, it is above most other movies.	5.0	Tarantino's Magnum Opus	2013-07-12	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2S9IG3Q8GF23B	Carol A. Wolf	Pulp Fiction is one of the most successful movies of the 90's. With Tarantino's breakout film Reservoir Dogs, this young director showed potential. Pulp Fiction was an even better film, and garnered even more respect.It's a movie in which there are seemingly random short stories, but by the end they all tie in. The movie starts off with a random scene in a restaurant that isn't mentioned tell the end, and halfway in between Bruce Willis is on screen, and by the end, you think to yourself that it all made sense.Tarantino really shines in his script and directing style. The script is fast paced and pretty mainstream, but its not dumbed down, like the word mainstream suggests. It has some pretty amazing and even intellectual lines. The sets look great, there is some great cinematography, like random camera angles at the opposite end of the hall, with the characters on the other end. Things like this makes the movie unique.The acting is great, and the roles were picked perfectly. This is a movie you can not miss, and is entertaining, but has a very great plot too.	5.0	Pulp Fiction Review	2011-04-08	4	3	1
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3EU6P17Q7868S	"Carol Frome ""Carol Frome, Author, Watermark &..."	The first time I saw this film, I left the theater and said, what the heck was that?! Tarantino's editing intersperses different storylines, while at the same time juggling the time line. So the scene you see in the diner near the beginning of the film is not the beginning of the story. You can also break the film down into couples (who are sometimes composed of one white person and one black person): Jules and Vincent, Mia and Marsellus, Jimmy and Bonnie, Hunny Bunny and Pumpkin, Lance and Jody, Butch and Adrian, Zed and Maynard.The film is violent and at points, bloody. Yet, immediately after one of the two most shocking scenes, you laugh. And then you say to yourself, I shouldn't be laughing at this. But you did. Why? In fact there's something comic about the whole film. The music and the editing contribute to this mood, but also the attitudes of the criminal, violent characters--who frequently discuss proper etiquette--and a Warner-Brothers-type cartoon motif that runs through the film. The most obvious moment arrives when Mia tells Vincent not to be a square, and as she draws a square in the air, it appears in animated form. Other cartoon moments are less obvious--people who spring back to life after devastating assaults to their bodies and a chase through the streets that very much takes on a roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote feeling, for example. So what is Tarantino trying to say? That real violence is disturbing, shocking and not funny? I think this may be the purpose of the non-linear editing, which takes episodes of violence and threat out of context. It makes the violence all the more shocking than it would be if you saw it in the usual linear format.It's a great film. Watch it on a big screen with big sound, if you can.	5.0	Excellent, Groundbreaking	2013-04-12	0	0	0

It would not fit so perfectly if the stories weren't out of order.  Travolta and Jackson play two hitmen, Vincent and Jules, Vincent takes Mia, their boss' wife on a date that goes horribly wrong. While on the other hand, jules decides to stop doing hits and live his life pure.  Then thurman plays Mia, Marcellus Wallace's wife, their boss. Bruce Willis plays Butch a boxer that was payed to throw a fight by Marcellus Wallace, but doesn't.  Harvey Keitel is the wolf an expert on disposing of dirty little secrets. Confused? Don't be. Quentin Terrantino did a great job of writing as well as directing. The directing although unorthodox is superb.

I am confused how Quentin Tarantino can simply glorify these social ills in a perveted fantasy, and then be annointed as a cinematic genius.  I can not appreciate how this trash can be put on film and still be mistaken for &quot;talent&quot;.  The vulgar lifestyles of the main characters are sickening.  Two common thugs murder while mocking religious scriptures, then they accidently murder another and are more concerned about the stains in the car upholstery?  What kind of story is this, and why is it considered entertainment?  I'm no prude and I'm certainly not a saint, but this is the kind of rubbish that give the US and Hollywood a black eye.  This is a distubing film and a sad commentary on the decline of the audience values.  One of the year's best films???  Sorry, I don't get it.	1.0	Garbage	2001-02-27	72	28	44

Quentin borrows much of the film ideas from other films he must have  watched countless times while working at video a store. It disgusted me the  first time with crude and often dump jokes, many things thrown in just to  be thrown in like gay rape, drug use, and a near overdoes of violence. In  fact, if you took all this out of the movie, it would be a blank tape. I  would prefer the blank tape.

It was a great movie, but I guess I wasn't prepared for PULP FICTION. It went so far out my boundaries that for almost half of the movie I was covering my eyes! I'm a big fan of action and vignette movies. Thought the 'action' was WAY too intense.NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART.After the brutal scenes of violence I was left thinking if I should laugh or be shocked at the way the sequence was shown. The scene that came to my mind immediately (and one of my favorites) was when Samuel Jackson and John Travolta was in the car driving with a man on the backseat. WOW!! I'm sure the people who saw PULP FICTION know what part I'm talking about.I guess the strong performances of the cast made it possible to make this movie what it is A VERY DARK ACTION/DRAMA/COMEDY	3.0	Violent &amp; Daring	2001-12-28	3	0	3

Of course, the non-sequential story-telling may make it difficult for some to tell where the start and finish are located. The way the scenes are all connected makes it difficult for me to pick out a favorite one, but I loved the final diner scene. Great roles for John Travolta and Bruce Willis, but Samuel L.

Why should you buy it when you have the DVD version? Well I have the DVD version, and I figured that a $3.99 gold box deal during black Friday week would make this a good value purchase.First, the film is truly gorgeous, for better or worse.  The transition to 1080p is wonderful.  There is very little technically unsound.  I noticed no overly sharp pixels, no dithering, no slow down, no bars... just clean and crisp resolution.  Seriously, this film is so sharp that I could see each and every pore on Samuel L Jackson's face.The extras are why you should buy this!  There are several mini-documentaries about the film and its effect on the film industry.  There are also interviews, award shows, making of, and a fun trivia pop up game.  And the usual deleted scenes (that were also on the DVD release), like the Elvis vs Rolling Stones conversation that never made it into the theatrical release.  Commentary is also nice.So even if you or someone you know has the film on DVD, this is an excellent gift for yourself or that person who truly enjoys the film and wants to get the most from it.	5.0	Wow!

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	ASU5IH3CM6XXE	ChrisTyrrell	Egads, this movie is a horrible, horrible film that you will find insufferable if you are an intelligent, thought-provoking filmgoer like myself.Number one, it's the worst editing that's ever been done in the history of the world of movies.  There are some characters that are killed off, but then appear in later scenes!  Uh...hello.  How sloppy can you be?!Also, John Travolta is a lot of delicious fun in this movie with Uma Thurman and Samuel Jackson, but there should have been a lot more scenes with him in it.  And many more with him dancing!  That's what people pay to see.  John Travolta should be dancing and romancing, and Samuel Jackson should be saying F-words, and Bruce Willis should be smirking while he walks on broken glass.  This movie employs some of that, but not nearly enough.I liked the music fine although it was too loud at times.  Also there was a bit too much druggy scenes and violence for my liking.  That's just not my cup of tea.  But I wouldn't hold that against them too much.  It's just that the story didn't make any sense and it wasn't very believable that all of this really happened.Harvey Keitel was not very good, and neither was Tim Roth.  And there is a lot of dialogue that seems unnecessary to the storyline, so they probably should have cut that and they would have had a nice, 90-minute action flick that any of us would have enjoyed.As it is, I think Director Quentin Tarantino may have finally made a stinker!!!Sincerely, Chris	2.0	Plop Fiction	2007-07-05	10	1	9

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A4WEZJOIZIV4U	"Chuck Bittner ""Disabled comedian & gamer!"""	"This is my favorite movie and down it's a classic and one that's worth watching multiple times! And I think that is a true testament of a classic and excellent movie, can you watch it more than once. And I think Pulp Fiction stands up to that challenge easily.Now I think the best part of this movie in my opinion is the dialogue. This movie help me to truly appreciate Quentin Tarantino's ability to make funny and interesting banter among his characters. For example just a funny way in which Vincent Vega convinces Jules Winfield that a foot massage mean something and Tony Rocky Horror should've known better. And in the way that Jules comes around to appreciate maybe it was semi-justified. With that in mind when you watch the scene with Vincent and Mia at Jack Rabbit Slim's where she makes Vincent see how ridiculous it would be for Marsalis to do that over a foot massage... it's just classic.It's little things like that that make this movie so awesome and fun to rewatch. Another scene that I totally love which is only about 30 seconds is when Vincent Vega and and Jules Winfield show up at the bar in the beginning of the second scene. The bartender welcomes them into the building and says "" what's up with them clothes?"" to which Jules replies ""you don't even want to know."" And once you watch the movie the gravity of that statement is so poignant and classic.Another one I told you love is the scenes with Lance and Vincent they are awesome. To me Eric Stoltz just crushes it is Lance and his demeanor and presentation is amazing. I love the scene where Vincent drives Over two Lance's is just so funny on so many levels.So I can say is you need to watch this movie and fall in love with it because it's so worth your time and money.So thanks for reading.PS I find myself constantly saying ""that is a tasty burger!""

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A7A1VNPVK4FLB	"""cinemajunkie"""	Not since Speilberg has a director been put on the map as quickly as Tarantino.  With only two films, Tarantino established himself as a fresh new talent.  Following up his cult classic Reservoir Dogs, he grilled up a kind of movie that only comes out every five or ten years.Pulp Fiction follows a handful of dark and eccentric figures over the course of two days.  There's Butch Coolidge, a prize fighter with a price on his head, played by Bruce Willis.  There's Vincent Vega and Jules Winnefield, two hitman played expertly by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson.  And of course, we also have the [pretty] Mia Wallace, a cocaine-fueled trophy wife, played by Uma Thurman.The film is told all over the place, with the beginning, middle, and end all mixed up in order to add tension to the audience.  The structure of the film is so well crafted you just won't believe it.  What makes this film so special is the humor.  At one point, Vincent and Jules are talking about God and divine intervention, which quickly ceases when Vincent accidentally shoots a guy they have in the face.  It is a moment that is so brilliant, nobody could copy it.This is, without a doubt, the most electrifying gangster film ever made, combining elements of Blaxploitation, Kung Fu, Film Noir, even Spaghetti Westerns.  The only flaw in this film is a few moments of superficial dialogue (Royale w/Cheese).  Some of it I just plain didn't believe, but it still had the power to make what is a long movie seem really short.  In the end, you feel so excited, you wish the movie wasn't over.I would continue, but I don't want to ruin for you what is a spectacular achievement in cinema.	5.0	An American Masterpiece	2003-02-17	12	4	8
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AZ5250G2U795I	C. K. Ogi	I will admit to being a huge fan of Pulp Fiction from my first 10 minutes into the theater and getting yanked by my shirt colllar into the story and not being released until the final credit rolled. OK, so I'm biased.BUT...it's not without well-earned bias. This movie easily qualified as an instant classic. The story is top notch, even though it comes in several different, smaller packages, Tarantino earns his directing stripes in effortlessly taking these seemingly random tales and believably weaving them all together. The acting/casting doesn't leave any stone unturned (It's Uma Thurman's best performance to date, Samuel Jackson WAS the best supporting actor winner that year, even if they didn't give him the trophy. Even Willis demonstrates some wicked acting chops in a beautifully understated performance.

Frothy but insubstantial may appeal to some but half the scenes went on and on and rest appeared to be  pointless.there was a culpable lack of tension, surely a reasonable element  for any crime picture. This was like a bad Elmore Leonard on an off day A  couple of days after the release, the fact that someone who hadnt seen the  film was telling me (who had seen it)it was greatest ever made, neatly sums  up the ridiculous hype that surrounded this nonsense.	1.0	Overated	1999-01-13	39	13	26

It's very hard to explain this movie because the movie is so odd and it's just hard to explain all of it. At the beginnng it shows Mr.Orange (the guy from RESEVOIR DOGS) except he is not Mr. Orange, he is somebody else with his girlfriend and they are robbing a diner. Then the movie goes through this whole story and you'll then understand at the end of the movie why they put this scene at the beginning. Anyway the movie is very bizarre but great. I myself am desperate for this DVD but can't get it quite yet. This definitely a must-must own DVD. GET IT.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3OEECMCM2T4KQ	C. Middleton	There is a very good friend of mine who has memorised the entire script, the whole dialogue of Pulp Fiction. This individual has the entire screenplay planted firmly in his head, quoting, explaining and ready to perform the entire film for nothing. Why he loves this film is easy to understand...it is a well written tale, the content is interesting, and the acting and soundtrack set a new precedent in American filmmaking.American Black Comedy and Tarantino had arrived.But did the American public understand that this new film, new in various technical innovations, and inventive in the standard storytelling model, the circular plot,and studiously criticises the industry of filmmaking and American life in general?Tarantino and Roger Avery won the Oscar in 1994 for best original screenplay, the actors, however, with the likes of Jackson and Travolta, received only nominations and nominations well worth it.There are many scenes in this film that deserve mention.Why I'm writing this review is that the film finally, after many years, has hit a time which is affordable. In Australia, at least, without steeling, of course, I could not buy this DVD under $30, and never, even during the affluent times, was this price acceptable.Well it is now.My good friend and I spent the afternoon viewing this film and laughing, feeling the tension, knowing, (because we have seen it so many times) every line, waiting for that one very cool line, to then laugh again.Well written, certainly, but the dialogue, makes the film.Jackson and Travolta are astounding; the repartee between these gangsters is a natural exchange between intelligent hit men, and something we had never seen before.I love this film and certainly recommend it to die-hard fans and to those people who have never seen before...Pulp Fiction was the turning point in 20th century American film.	5.0	An Enduring American Black Comedy	2006-10-29	7	4	3

I know this movie has been trashed by self-proclaimed moralists, but the film is a vivid reminder that the world  is not the way we want it to be.John Travolta stole the spotlight; his  portrayal of Vincent Vega is, by far, the best work he's ever done. Samuel  Jackson was also great. I also enjoyed Bruce Willis as the boxer -- his  performance was quite impressive. I also enjoyed Uma Thurman and Rosanna  Arquette in their supporting roles.I recommend Pulp Fiction. The acting,  the incredibly witty script, and the way it was put together is a piece of  work!

There is an earfull of swearing, sexual content, excessive violence, and loads of drug abuse.  But this movie is fantastic!!! If you like Bruce Willis or John Travolta films, you will enjoy this.  This is a film separted as different stories, yet at the end they are all connected.  Tons and tons of stars.  Bruce Willis plays a struggling boxer, John Travolta & Samuel L. Jackson are hitmen, Ving Rhams is a mobster, Uma Thurman is the mobster's wife, Christopher Walken palys a war hero, Harvey Keitel is a specialist of some kind that gets rid of evidence of murders, Tim Roth is a robber, and many, more stars.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A26N27LJVQNVI1	crank	The color tone of this film, supposedly okay'd by Tarantino, is too oversaturated compared to the original. A foreign PF has the right color timing and I suggest people go there. I'm not sure what to make of it but when you look closely and compare the two there is something definitely wrong about  what they have here. Things are just too saturated.It looks ugly whatever it is. My solution: get one of the international versions. I don't really know what else to do. I can't stand when people fiddle with little things like this and make the picture appear completely different than it used to be. Keep in mind this is NOT simple drift of colors like in Aliens or Blade Runner. Those films look fantastic to me despite some not liking the teal or whatever, it certainly fits their mood and tone. This is different. This is oversaturation and it looks nasty.If you okay something like this for your best film I think you would okay it for other versions if you were concerned? Well, frankly, it doesn't seem like a huge deal to Tarantino. So, you know, until they fix this I'd pay less if you can for this version or spend a little more for an international one.	3.0	Color timing issues on the Bluray.	2013-11-29	0	0	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3D3GKLLZO2VC9	"""crashdog9"""	To call &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; ingenious would be an understatement. Everything about this movie just seems to be perfect, from the acting to the directing to the dialogue to the soundtrack to the storyline--well, the  list goes on and on. Just the style, the atmosphere, the environment  surrounding this fascinating group of people, draws you in and keeps you  enthralled until the very last line (&quot;I think we should be  leaving&quot;) is uttered. Though the characters do perform technically  &quot;illegal&quot; acts, one must look beyond the acts themselves and see  people who struggle with justifying these acts. This is what makes this  movie simply brilliant, its endless shades of gray infusing a vividly  colorful film.	5.0	The most clever, witty movie of the 90's	2000-06-29	2	1	1
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AHCLXISLLYW7X	crock921	This movie resides in my Top 5 list of all-time favorite movies, so there may be some bias in my review since I am such a huge fan. I did not see this movie when it came out in 1994. I did not become aware of it for sometime after that. I was not a Tarantino fan, so I went into this movie with a completely open mind. What I saw over the course of the film was not only mind blowing, but I would go as far as to say life-altering. The way the scenes are shot, the use of music, and the incredible dialogue and mastery of the human language sets this movie apart on a level with the classics. On top of the wonderful cinematography, the acting is superb as well. Seeing people like Sam Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, and Ving Rhames in a film before becoming superstars shows the brilliance of the casting.If you are not offended my violence and profanity, I would recommend you buy this film immediately as you will want to watch it over and over to appreciate all of the nuances of this modern day masterpiece.	5.0	Top 5 List	2009-07-04	0	0	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A347ARHIMXRD5I	Crystal Edmonds	As one who was only 12 when Pulp Fiction was first released, and therefore, too young to appreciate it's significance, I have a great appreciation for the extras on this edition.  There are the usual items; director commentary, trailers (in multiple languages for international audiences), but there are also deleted scenes, each of which start with an explanation by Tarantino as to why each scene was cut.  And to sweeten the deal, the second disk also includes an episode of Siskel & Ebert from 1994 where the pair discuss the popularity and the significance of the film.  They compare and contrast Pulp Fiction with Resivoir Dogs, which at the time, was the only other film Tarantino was known for.  There is also footage from the Cannes Film Festival that Pulp Fiction won with ease.  Anyone who likes this film needs this edition of Pulp Fiction, not only because it is such a good movie, but because it carries with it all the proof anyone could ask for that this film is an achievement in pop culture history, and deserves a place among the classics.	5.0	Fun and fascinating.	2005-01-26	0	0	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A39PE7YSCTA4TK	Crystal	If you said Quentin Tarintino then &quot;Disco&quot;(a line delivered by Uma Thurman as Mia). I love Quentin Tarintino's films he has a unique twisted touch that no other director has in the film industry. Never before  have I seen a film like Pulp Fiction, a funky collection of differnt goings  on all involving a cast of very diverse characters. This film has  action,comedy and some revival of catch phrases from past generations. One  of my favorite scenes would have to be the dance contest, and then the  scene in the car where the gun accidently goes off. So if your a fan of  twisted anything is possible films and Tarintino than pick this up.	5.0	Who's one of the best directors in Hollywood?	2000-06-11	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1FZ5G3ACIE5AT	"""cwnewyorker"""	Much has been made of PULP FICTION's loopy narrative structure, graphic violence, pop culture dialogue, and far-reaching influence.  But what about the emotional fervency of Samuel Jackson's performance and the film's extraordinarily moving conclusion?  Quentin Tarantino's work here is incredible: he keeps characters, situations, jokes, and motifs in the air like an expert pizza thrower.  The dialogue is rich, funny, and hip.  The performances are terrific and a sense of dangerous fun keeps the picture spinning.  A vignette in the middle of the film involving a drug overdose and a terrifying method of resucitation bounces off the walls with kinetic energy and a lengthy monologue delivered by Christopher Walken ends with a punchline so unexpected, you're doubled over with laughter.  But the film takes a thoughtful turn at the end, countering this joyful mayhem with a powerful monologue, delivered with brio and furious concentration by Samuel Jackson.  It's about religion.  It's about redemption.  The rogue's gallery of lowlife characters we've just spent two and a half hours with are searching their souls.  And underneath the bloodshed lies a deep humanity.  Plus, the soundtrack's a killer.	5.0	Le Big Mac	2004-01-04	3	1	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A33D09LM3O34Y	Dale Rhines	What I find interesting about this film is the strong reaction so many people have to it.  I mean people who have never even seen the movie have strong opinions about it.  This movie was a major release in 1994 and got seven Oscar nominations, and looking back at it now, one has to wonder why Forrest Gump was named Best Picture over this amazing movie.  This is not to bash Forrest- hell I like the movie, but if I had to have just one of them on a island I would take Pulp Fiction- and I suspect Tom Hanks would as well.  The movie is great- full of wonderful dialogue and a terrific cast (Samuel Jackson not winning the Oscar in 1994 for Best Supporting Actor is one if the worst decisions by the Academy in the 1990's).  This movie hums along with a terrific soundtrack.  The movie consists of three different, yet related, stories set in Los Angeles and I won't cover the plot details here- you have either seen the movie and know it or you haven't, in which case I don't want to spoli it for you.  Buy this movie.  It gets better with each viewing and you pick up little details that may have been missed in the first viewing.  The 2 DVD set is outstanding with great extras including a commentary, a making of featurette, and deleted scenes.  This is all good stuff.  The movie can also be watched with a enhanced trivia track that provides interesting tidbits on the bottom of the screen.  I really liked that feature. Also, there are a number of reviews and articles about the movie reprinted on the DVD, including a real good one by Rober Ebert that breaks down the film in detailed fashion.  The new edition of Pulp Fiction is a huge improvement over the previous DVD release.  The sound is terrific as is the color print.  AFI named it one of the 100 best films of the century and they were right.  This is a fun ride and don't be put off by all the talk of gore.  Plenty of films are more bloody and much of the violence in this film is implied. This is two hours of sitting on the edge of the seat waiting to find out what happens next.  Sit back and let Jules, Vic, Pumpkin and Mr. Wolf take you on a roller coaster ride.  This is one that belongs in any film lover's collection.	5.0	Meet me at Jack Rabbit Slim's	2003-01-05	6	1	5

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	'Pulp Fiction' is and will always be remembered as one of the defining moments in cinema today.  Upon it's release it opened eyes and paved the way for films to come that will continue to draw from this masterpiece of a film, never being able to capture what made this so brilliant in the first place.  With his second film, follow up to 92's 'Reservoir Dogs', Quentin Tarantino solidified his Hollywood status as a brilliant director/writer.  The story behind 'Pulp Fiction' is one we've never seen, and one that will never be seen again, at least not to the original brilliance here.The film opens with a conversation between Pumpkin (Roth) and Honey Bunny (Plummer), lovers who are about to knock over a restaurant.  This whole film is about conversations, conversations that may or may not pertain to the events about to occur but which add depth to the characters you're watching on the screen.The next scene introduces us to hit men Vincent Vega (Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Jackson) as they are about to make a hit for mob-boss Marsellus Wallace (Rhames).  The conversation that ensues is fluent, natural and not what you'd expect.  It's called a brilliant script coupled with brilliant acting.  Besides being ordered to make this hit, Vincent has also been asked to tend to Marsallus's wife Mia (Thurman) while he's out of town on business.  After hearing that Marsellus is quite the jealous type (having just thrown a man from a five story building for allegedly rubbing Mia's feet) he's a bit edgy about tending to her needs while Marsellus is away.Marsellus is also taking care of some business with boxer Butch Coolidge (Willis), a prizefighter whom Marsellus has just paid to take the fall.  When Butch decides to renig, winning the match and attempting to split town with his girlfriend Fabieene (de Medeiros) Marsellus hires Vega to take him out.These three stories get interwoven in not so chronological order giving us three great stories that make one really awesome movie.  Uma is stunning and captivating, Travolta is o top of his game and Jackson is scene stealing in his best role ever.  Willis and Rhames feed off each other perfectly and add a side story that is both hilarious in it's own seriousness.  Great film most everyone can enjoy.  There's a reason this film is considered legendary!	5.0	"""Zed is dead..."""	2006-08-07	8	3	5

The Travolta-Thurman sequence seems especially forced and tedious now, and the set-up of the Bruce Willis-Ving Rhames showdown is shamefully flabby. And the closing diner sequence is beyond anticlimactic.Tarantino seems so determined to display his own prodigious cleverness that he refuses to impose any economy on the story or how it's told. As a result, what might have been a fast-paced, dizzying thrill ride with some judicious editing is instead a leaden, 160-minute valentine from Quentin Tarantino to his own perceived genius.	2.0	Overlong, overstuffed, overrated	2003-07-07	28	18	10

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1R8AO9XASQ15C	Daniel A. Marsh	&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is a drunken romp through almost every conceivable film genre. In its &quot;chapters&quot; one can detect Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns, Kurosawa's Samurai epics, John Ford's manly action dramas, the New Wave, 70s schlock, blaxploitation, and, of course, &quot;Saturday Night Fever.&quot;It is the definitive Tarantino film and the definitive film of the 1990s, and is far more than just a genre piece, but a commentary on cinema itself. Not a moment of QT's spectacular stunt would have worked without the healthy doses of irony and humor injected into the script, which is one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century.This movie is burned into my brain. I don't need to watch it, as I can quote the dialogue along with the characters. &quot;PF&quot; is not for everyone; it is profane and violent. Either you love this movie, as I do, or you hate it. There is no in between. I don't think Tarantino would have had it any other way.	5.0	The definitive film of the 1990s	2004-04-28	5	3	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2PDC6SESC021Q	Daniel	"Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. His new movie ""Pulp Fiction"" is a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations.Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst. Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes ""Pulp Fiction"" crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night.The screenplay, by Tarantino and Roger Avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it - the noses of those zombie writers who take ""screenwriting"" classes that teach them the formulas for ""hit films."" Like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Pulp Fiction"" is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next. It doubles back on itself, telling several interlocking stories about characters who inhabit a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses and loud desperation. The title is perfect. Like those old pulp mags named ""Thrilling Wonder Stories"" and ""Official Detective,"" the movie creates a world where there are no normal people and no ordinary days - where breathless prose clatters down fire escapes and leaps into the dumpster of doom.The movie resurrects not only an aging genre but also a few careers.John Travolta stars as Vincent Vega, a mid-level hit man who carries out assignments for a mob boss. We see him first with his partner Jules (Samuel L. Jackson); they're on their way to a violent showdown with some wayward Yuppie drug dealers, and are discussing such mysteries as why in Paris they have a French word for Quarter Pounders. They're as innocent in their way as Huck and Jim, floating down the Mississippi and speculating on how foreigners can possibly understand each other.Travolta's career is a series of assignments he can't quite handle. Not only does he kill people inadvertently (""The car hit a bump!"") but he doesn't know how to clean up after himself. Good thing he knows people like Mr. Wolf (Harvey Keitel), who specializes in messes, and has friends like the character played by Eric Stoltz, who owns a big medical encyclopedia, and can look up emergency situations.Travolta and Uma Thurman have a sequence that's funny and bizarre. She's the wife of the mob boss (Ving Rhames), who orders Travolta to take her out for the night. He turns up stoned, and addresses an intercom with such grave, stately courtesy Buster Keaton would have been envious. They go to Jack Rabbit Slim's, a 1950s theme restaurant where Ed Sullivan is the emcee, Buddy Holly is the waiter, and they end up in a twist contest. That's before she overdoses and Stoltz, waving a syringe filled with adrenaline, screams at Travolta, ""YOU brought her here, YOU stick in the needle! When I bring an O.D. to YOUR house, I'LL stick in the needle!""Bruce Willis and Maria de Medeiros play another couple: He's a boxer named Butch Coolidge who is supposed to throw a fight, but doesn't. She's his sweet, naive girlfriend, who doesn't understand why they have to get out of town ""right away."" But first he needs to make a dangerous trip back to his apartment to pick up a priceless family heirloom - a wristwatch. The history of this watch is described in a flashback, as Vietnam veteran Christopher Walken tells young Butch about how the watch was purchased by his great-grandfather, ""Private Doughboy Orion Coolidge,"" and has come down through the generations - and through a lot more than generations, for that matter. Walken's monologue builds to the movie's biggest laugh.The method of the movie is to involve its characters in sticky situations, and then let them escape into stickier ones, which is how the boxer and the mob boss end up together as the captives of weird leather freaks in the basement of a gun shop. Or how the characters who open the movie, a couple of stick-up artists played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, get in way over their heads. Most of the action in the movie comes under the heading of crisis control.If the situations are inventive and original, so is the dialogue. A lot of movies these days use flat, functional speech: The characters say only enough to advance the plot. But the people in ""Pulp Fiction"" are in love with words for their own sake. The dialogue by Tarantino and Avary is off the wall sometimes, but that's the fun. It also means that the characters don't all sound the same: Travolta is laconic, Jackson is exact, Plummer and Roth are dopey lovey-doveys, Keitel uses the shorthand of the busy professional, Thurman learned how to be a moll by studying soap operas.It is part of the folklore that Tarantino used to work as a clerk in a video store, and the inspiration for ""Pulp Fiction"" is old movies, not real life. The movie is like an excursion through the lurid images that lie wound up and trapped inside all those boxes on the Blockbuster shelves. Tarantino once described the old pulp mags as cheap, disposable entertainment that you could take to work with you, and roll up and stick in your back pocket. Yeah, and not be able to wait until lunch, so you could start reading them again."	5.0	Royale with Cheese...	2003-05-14	5	2	3
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A13RM1AWD1C5ZR	Daniel K.	"Pulp Fiction, the 1994 film which stunned the world.  Critics hailed this film as ""the film which has redefined motionpictures in the 20th century,"" and it surely did.Quentin Tarantion followed up with Pulp Fiction after his superb debut, Reservoir Dogs, infact it's hard for me to say which I liked better, because they're equally phenomenal.  Pulp Fiction also led many actors on the road to stardom including John Travolta who delivered a great performance, but the real star here is Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield.  Jackson just has a presence on screen which is fantastic, his portrayal of anger is displayed so realistically and whenever he recites a certain passage from the Bible, it makes you quiver in a sense.The film revolves around three different stories, one involving two hitmen, Travolta and Jackson another involving a boxer (Bruce Willis) and the 3rd involves a couple planning on robbing a restaurant (Tim Roth and Plummer).  Also features nice performances from Ving Rhames who plays the manager of Willis who soon gets involved in a huge dispute with him, Uma Thurman who plays Mia Wallce, she's the girl John Travolta has to babysit.  Eric Stolz as Lance, Harvey Keital as Mr. Wolf, Christopher Walken and Quentin Tarantino also show up in some cameo performances.  Tarantino along with Roger Avary won the oscar for Best Original Screenplay in the 1995 Academy Awards and it's easy to see why.  This is one the best films of the decade, and still remains to be, it's a cult classic.Pulp Fiction is rated R for Strong Graphic Violence and Drug Use, Pervasive Strong Language and Some Sexuality.  The violence is graphic, and you're obviously going to be expecting that, I mean come on it's a Quentin Tarantino film.  Violence includes bloody gunplay and fisticuffs.  The profanity is excessive and non-stop essentially and it's also quite strong.Drug Use and sexual innuendo, there is a nasty and unpleasant rape sequence, but not exceptionally explicit.  There's also implied nudity, specifialliy when Bruce Willis gets out of the shower and we really don't need to see, well I'll leave that to your imagination.  All in all, a fine picture and definetly is worth owning on Video or DVD, specifally the Collector's Edition on DVD, it's packed with special features.  Add this to your collection and check other Tarantion films: Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown, Kill Bill, Vol. 1 and soon to be released Kill Bill, Vol. 2. (April 16, 2004)."	4.0	Pulp Fiction- No One Does It Like Tarantino Can	2004-02-08	1	0	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A14KBUQPYKMZYL	David A. Brown	I saw Pulp Fiction when it first created such a buzz in the theaters.  The soundtrack is one of the best of the 1990's.This movie is just fun, there is so much thoughtful dialogue to chew on.I saw part of the movie on TV a few weeks ago and decided to get the DVD to add to my collection.When I watched it the other night, something occured to me-- when Mia (Uma Thurman) and Vincent (John Travolta) arrive at Jack Rabbit Slims for their dinner, she comments to him that an Elvis man should love this place.  I distinctly remember on TV a few weeks ago that they had a discussion before they reached Jack Rabbit Slims about how some people were Elvis people and others were Beatles people.  I don't remember that scene in the DVD though.  I might have to watch it again to be sure it's really missing though.The movie has violence, drug use, and lots of profanity, but I think the great story telling still makes it a fun movie.  There is lots of humor in this movie, in a twisted sort of way.Want to watch it in chronological order?  Watch the chapter (3?) right after the main titles with Vincent and Jules riding in the car.  Then jump to 22.  (scene 1, with Pumpkin and Honey Bunny happens concurrently with the restaurant scene) After that, I think it goes to 4 (the scene where Butch (Bruce Willis) is talking to Marsellus Wallace about fixing the fight) and then watch straight through till he rides off on the chopper.I give it 4 stars only because of the lack of goodies on the disc.	4.0	Entertaining, but not for the politically correct	2001-01-11	1	1	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	David Anderson	Quinton Tarantino produces, directs, and writes &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; wonderfully, giving it a unique 70's funky vibe.  His quality deserved him the Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay for 1994.  The movie combines three different stories that brilliantly connect one another by editing.  John Travolta makes a triumphant comeback, making this his best performance since &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;.  Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and he are well-deserving of their Oscar nominations for their acting roles.  The Travolta and Thurman dance club scene is unforgettable.  Thurman's next scene is when she shines more than anywhere else(can't say how).It may have to be watched a second time to fall in love with &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.  After that, it's addictive.  However, the only complaint is that one may have &quot;Girl, You'll Be a Woman&quot; stuck in their head for a couple days.  This movie will be a classic for years to come.	5.0	Back to the 70's gracefully	2003-07-20	0	0	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"I remember seeing ""Pulp Fiction"" in the theatre back in 1994.  It was during the scene where Jules(Samuel L. Jackson) was berating Brad.  A group of older moviegoers were squirming in their seats.  After a few more minutes of Jules' tirade the group walked out of the theatre in disgust.  It was then that I knew I was watching something great.  Only a director of consummate skill could get that kind of reaction from an audience.  One has to go back to the seventies when Scorsese, Spielberg, et al. emerged on the scene to find a truly original voice in American cinema.  Tarantino re-wrote the rules on how to structure a film.  He structured ""Reservoir Dogs"" in a similar fashion but not on the scale that he did in ""Pulp Fiction"".  His dialogue, interspersed with profanity and pop-cultural references, is priceless.  The use of pop music, probably records in his personal collection, to comment on the action is superb.  The actors he recruited for this film(John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames) had their careers either jump-started or revived because of this project.  I remember at the time it was predicted that Tarantino's brand of film-making would be copied by others.  Some tried, but the only master of this style is Tarantino himself.  This is an important film in the scheme of American cinema because it shows that the rules for making a film can be changed and for the better.  This is not even my favorite Tarantino film (actually the more conventional, linear ""Jackie Brown"" is) but it is the film that introduced him to the ""mainstream""."	5.0	Tarantino Arrives	2004-09-25	7	4	3

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1QXN22NDLTQTS	David	"Although this movie is built on a reasonnably solid foundation, the true genius of Pulp Fiction lies in it's eyepleasing exteria!!!!! Dan Brown, writer of the best selling book, the Da Vinci Code, thinks that what QT has done is very innovative and will have impact on all films to come!! CAN I GET A REWIND? ""Presenting a film with such an eyepleasing exteria was always considered to have capitalistic overtones,"" says Dan Brown, writer of the Da Vinci Code, ""It was considered a tried and tested method. IT came to be known, therefore, that such films were seldom creative or original because of their commercial nature.""Since QT was arguably the king of independent movies, it was hard for Dan Brown, writer of the best selling book, the Da Vinci Code, to apply a capitalistic tag to QT's new film: ""Although the genius of the film lies in it's exteria,"" says Brown, ""it cannot be considered shallow or inferior because it's interior is abnormally strong aswell."" And so, a new generation of cinema was created: Trainspotting, Kill Bill, Fight Club, AHX, Power Rangers, Kevin and Perry do America. These films certainly had no commercial overtones.Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction is the most sexually captivating woman in movie history! She holds all the quintessential female qualities that make men happy. She's intelligent, beautiful, slim, eager, cute, sexy, doughty, fearless, oblivious, assertive (but not arrogant or obnoxios), dangerous, adorable, blissful, delicate, and powerful. The clothes that QT dresses her in are interesting too, they cling to her body showing off her beautiful, slim feminine shape! The contrast in colours of her clothes! The vibrancy of her make up. The Vincent\Mia dance scene was probably the best sex scene in movie history..

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A103KNDW8GN92L	David Hugaert	"With excellent timing and precision, I might add. ""Pulp Fiction"" is one box office blockbuster that certainly doesn't compromise on principle, as it features four uniquely interwoven,  well-written and well-thought-out storylines, which will leave the average viewer baffled and bewildered by their outcomes. ""PF"" is unique in its' premise, in that this picture's scenes, in a way, were shot backwards, instead of in one continuing sequence, to leave the viewer free to come up with his or her own theory as to how each of these separate plots came to their respective introduction and conclusion. It is also funny and ironic that both opening and closing scenes were shot at the same locale, with the same exact sequence, too, creating a bunch of loose ends left for the viewer to tie together, as noted above, leaving the viewer to use his or her imagination here. Director Quentin Tarantino lets the audience participate in this upstanding masterpiece, and doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence in the process, which is only part of the beauty of watching a movie of this caliber. The other part, is watching ""PF""'s all-star cast add their individual perspectives and talents to each of the characters they portray, with both John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson portraying savvy and suave hit men, Bruce Willis portraying a tough-guy boxer and Ving Rhames playing a near-accomplice who's out to get Willis, among other performers featured here, including a cameo by Tarantino himself. All in all, ""Pulp Fiction"" is Quentin Tarantino's absolute best directorial study in contrast, and is a real eye-opener, with not one boring moment, whatsoever. The VHS Special Edition also features some added trailer footage at the conclusion of the film, narrated by Tarantino himself - another outstanding reason why ""Pulp Fiction"" is a must-see, must own motion picture that belongs in every movie buff's video library!"	5.0	Tarantino Brings It All Together!	2002-07-29	4	3	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A38EQCXYMH63QX	David Slicer	Pulp Fiction, in my opinion ,is truly the kind of film that really has all  the elements of a great film that I will probably never forget.Director  Quentin Tarentino directed this well deserved Academy Award winning film  that delivers everything a moviegoer would expect.Great acting,story and a  really cool soundtrack make this film worth seeing.The film is violent at  times and there are some scenes that are really graphic.John Travolta and  Samuel L.Jackson both play hitmen.Bruce Willis plays a down on his luck  boxer.Vinge Rhames delivers a really great performance as a crime boss.Uma  Thurman,his wife.Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer as lovers who get off on  robbing people.Christopher Walken and Harvey Keitel both appear in  hilarious appearences.A group of stories all connect into one terrific film  that really took me on a trip.I forgot to mention Eric Stoltz and Rosanna  Arquette.Both of their performances are well written.The entire cast was  well written.The scene where Samuel L.Jackson recites a bible passage  before killing Frank Wayles has to be the coldest but most impressive  scenes in filmmaking to date.If you havent seen Pulp Fiction,give it a  try.It deserves to be seen.	5.0	One of the best films I've seen in years.	2000-09-05	12	8	4

The first time I  watched the movie I wasn't a bit confused about this movie's un-cohesive  plot.This movie is reminiscent of the Pulp comics and magazines from  yester-year, with it's high octane violence, graphic depiction of drugs,  and of course...sex.What I personally liked about Pulp was that  characters can enter or exit the movie at anytime without much explanation.  One minute you see John Travolta...next minute he is blown to bits by a  M-16 machine gun. No questions asked.Quentin definitely establishes that  he knows what he doing, with unique camera angles, sparkling script, and  wonderful acting...some of it done by the master himself!I reccomend  anyone watch this movie. It's completely awesome if you can handle the  content.oh yeah. &quot;saved by a miracle of God&quot; refers to a  memorable line by Samuel L Jackson who plays a hitman that is convinced  that the reason he survived near death is beacuse God's mighty hand came  down and stopped the bullets. He soon quits his profession while on the  other hand John Travolta stays...and we all know what happens to him! heh  heh heh heh heh heh	5.0	&quot;Saved by a miracle of God...&quot;	2000-09-08	3	0	3

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2HS7RBQ02BUO6	"D. Barr ""Too many movies"""	"Friend PricesFor all its reputation of hard-hitting action and  harder sexuality, ""Pulp Fiction"" contains some of the sweetest moments  between men and women that have ever been filmed.  In its own way, this is  one of the best of the Chick Flicks.  Not only does Travolta's  character not take advantage of a woman to whom he is deeply attracted,  when a terrible crisis arises, he stands by her. True, if he violates her  very formidable husband's trust, his only alternative is to cut and run and  hope her husband never finds him -- a lot of people are on the run from the  guy, anyway -- but Travolta's character hangs in there.  By the end of  their scenes together, Travolta's and Thurman's characters are best buds,  with the kinds of secrets that buddies keep.  Bruce Willis may rant and  rave at his own girlfriend -- the actress is obviously playing a woman who  grew up with a lot of abuse -- but he takes responsibility for his own  mistakes, and instead of blaming her, he actually apologizes to her.  He's  polite and pleasant with the bloodthirsty cab-driver.  Plenty of tension in  these relationships, but no harm.  When Thurman's character is alone  with her husband, she is obviously completely happy and at ease.  Her  husband and she never talk to one another -- but we receive the clue to  their relationship when she says,""Don't you hate those uncomfortable  silences?""  She wants a man she can be silently happy with.  Somebody she  can just sit and enjoy life with.  Maybe she is a trophy wife, maybe she  just wants her husband for his money.  Who knows?  It doesn't harm anyone.  They're both happy and comfortable and stable with each other.  Her husband  has trouble with other people, but not with her.  The pitiful little  robber couple in the restaurant obviously adore one another, and will stand  by each other, come hell or bad robberies.  Theirs is probably the sweetest  relationship in the movie.  And if we want to observe the Perfect  Couple, we have Travolta and Jackson.  They literally cannot live without  each other, at least not as long as they remain in their world.  Harvey  Keitel and his girlfriend are the picture of great pals.  Everybody should  go to breakfast like that.  When the characters do favors for each  other, they remember the favors, and reciprocate.  In a way they reflect  the natural gratitude of predators -- do something good for a predator, and  that animal will never forget.  Aesop got it right.  Nobody forgets who's  done right by him or her.  These are Friend Prices.  The only time the  Couple goes wrong is with Christopher Walken and his prison buddy.  They  hang together, but Walken's character is boiling over with resentment.  He's been handed a Fairy Tale that shines in the past, and tried to pass it  on.  But the closer you get to today, the more true and the more mean the  Fairy Tale always gets.  Could be it was because Walken and his buddy  didn't -- so to speak -- Watch Out.  The characters in ""Pulp Fiction""  are as good and honest and true as their lives allow them to be.  Hats off  to Tarantino for giving us these thoroughly sympathetic rats and runners.  We couldn't imagine ourselves, in the same situations, acting any other  way.  It's a lesson in How To Be Nice To Your Girlfriend -- or your Buddy  or Pal or Boyfriend, for that matter."	5.0	Friend Prices	2000-05-29	2	1	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1FCC7YWBAHLRD	Dennis Gabriel	"Pulp Fiction is the ultimate playground for the mind of Quentin Tarrantino. The movie is a blindingly repressed spewage of pop culture, brilliant setup, drug excrement, softcore porn, and a magnificent mixture of philosophy, religion and violence. The movie's mood almost has us as tied to a chair as Ving Rhames and Bruce Willis are in the excruciatingly painful gimp sequence. Thus retrained, we are blasted on a whirlwind tour of the hippest of the hip. So hip, in fact, that we want to blow our brains out after it is over. Samuel Jackson gives the performance that will undoubtedly mark his career. It is a performance that is disturbed, hysterical, deadly, funny, compassionate, smart and scared (yes, scared.) He's a quote dynamo and is given more great things to say then possibly any character in movie history. Travolta is slick, slimy and stupidly sharp in his role. He's one of the few guys who comes off as an actor in this movie and not a lost soul in the new wave beat generation of the mid-90's. The cast is a who's who of the best cult actors of the mid-90's and Tarrantino gets them to deliver stunning performances. And why not? The dialogue is possibly the best written verbage for any film ever made and is a Holy Grail for fans of offbeat and subculture cinema. From ""the holiest of holies"" to ""correctamundo"", the movie is the masterpiece for a guy so immersed in pop culture that he needs an oar to navigate it all. Roth is dynamic in a relatively small part and Ammanda Plummer is like a shrieking little wicked witch. Uma Thurman is a thinking man's dream. She's vulnerable, demonstrative, and most of all, playful. The dancing sequence is priceless and needs no further discussion. Eric Stoltz is like that cool guy that everyone knew in high school that no one really paid much attention to but everyone liked. Bruce Willis is also in his zone as Butch the boxer. Willis has a nice blend of sensitivity and brutality. Any more or less probably would not have worked. The movie also rips on all cultures virutally equally with a burst of fresh air. The movie is more sympathetic towards blacks and not at all towards Southerners but that is par for the course in the civil rights revival in the 1990's. Shooting a movie of this length out of sequence was a tremendous gamble but the dialogue holds it together and it is, doubtlessly, brilliantly creative. The movie's weakness, like other Tarrantino movies, is it's obsession with believing that the drug subculture is somehow right about life and most other facets are somehow less then right or flat out wrong. Tarrantino evolved this idea slightly by the end of the movie and continued it in one of the best B-movies ever made, From Dusk Till Dawn. However, Tarrantino's glorification of radicalism gets old at times and falls flat by the end of the movie due to it's length. All in all, this movie is an all time classic for cinema junkies and pop culture nuts and will pop like champagne in circles away from the power players and the mainstream."	4.0	Insightful	2009-09-21	1	0	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	ABN5K7K1TM1QA	Dennis Littrell	"It rocks.  It jumps.  It moves.  It's flashy and clever.  The acting is excellent.  The direction is interesting...  I could write a book, but what I kept thinking was how much the audience worships not just the violence, but the power.  How much they love the Fascist criminal, the mob boss who must be obeyed and shown loyalty to.  Uma Thurman is just decadently sexy.  John Travolta is amazingly lovable as a ""low-rent"" hood and Bruce Willis is believable as a prize fighter who turns the tables and wins the fight instead of throwing it (and, in an up-to-date spin, bets on himself-seems right!  How come they never did that before?  They probably did, I just missed it.).  Samuel Jackson is interesting as the Bible-quoting black hit man.Naturally they make us root for the bad guys; indeed the bad guys are almost always the heroes in the modern Hollywood.  We can really explore ourselves only as bad guys.  The pro-mo's for cigarettes, heroin, cocaine, booze and decadence are getting a little thin, however.  A Hollywood movie, a commercial flick, is always a clich&eacute;.  The art part comes from doing spins on the clich&eacute;, in putting a new twist on the old BS, on the old standards.  Ironically interesting was the sensuous indulgence of dinner for Travolta and Thurman.  He's shot heroin, she's done a few lines, they smoke some pot, they smoke some cigarettes, but they really get off on milk shakes and vanilla cokes, steaks and hamburgers.  Poor Hollywood.  They've done it all and now must find real indulgence in fat, salt, sugar and meat, which for the stars really is an indulgence.  If your life span is only sixteen to about thirty-five, then the forbidden things really are fat, salt, meat and anything else that puts on the weight.  Cocaine and cigarettes can't hurt you because by the time the ill effects kick in, your career is over anyway."	4.0	We can really explore ourselves only as bad guys	2005-03-03	3	1	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2OFSDJB3MVQ16	Dennis W. Wong	"The year this landmark film came out another off-beat film matched it in box office power or perhaps surpassed it, ""Forrest Gump"" which swept the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay but Tarantino's film has influenced many films thereafter like ""Lucky Number 7"", ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" plus many other Guy Ritchie's films.  So which is the better film, I would be reluctant to say since everyone in ""Fiction"" is perfectly cast from Travolta to Willis, there's hardly a non-memorable moment in the whole 2 hour plus running time.  So all I can say at this point it's a matter of taste between a comedic dark film noir and a fable expertly done as ""Forrest Gump""."	5.0	Pulp looking good in Hi-Def	2011-10-24	4	2	2

Pulp Fiction is the 2nd film by Quentin Tarantino, who also made the entertaining Kill Bill movies.SPOILERS AHEADThe story tells about a crime gang and their adventures. The first story is about one of the hitmen, Vincent, taking care of the boss's wife, Mia, while he's gone. [Mia is played by Uma Thurman, the same person who played The Bride in KB. She looks WAY different in this movie!] But, oops! Mia takes some strong drugs and passes out, with halarious results!The second is about a boxer who betrayed the crime boss and is now hiding from him. Later, the boss and the boxer run into two Michael Jackson like rednecks! Uh-oh!!!!The third has to do with the hitmen accidentaly shooting a person in their car and now they have to take it up to a friends. After cleaning it up, they go to a coffe shop, and run into two robbers!A little note: I think the order of the stories are this: 3, 1,2.END SPOILERSThe stories are SLIGHTLY out of order, mostly the third story. The swearing, well, lots! F words all over! Even the N word here and there! Pretty violent too.The dialouge, BRILLIANT! Lots of spicy discussions and topics. Like candy. The acting is great too.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AFTEDMW813PAW	D. Gorman  &#34;Crystalline Structure Moon&#34;	"I am even disappointed about being disappointed by this movie because I loved Quentin's ""Resevoir Dogs"".  But this flick was so painfully contrived, poorly written and conceived, and so dependent on transparent cheesy ploys to get attention that it is just totally unwatchable.  The pretty girl just because you need a pretty girl (especially on commercial posters and DVD covers), the John Travolta dance scene because they needed to exploit the popularity of Saturday Night Fever, the overdose scene just to show we can film such a thing, the buggery scene just for shock value....and on and on....all very transparent ploys to get attention, shock the faint-hearted and draw in the gullible masses that'll watch anything that shocks the faint-hearted and righteous types.  Everything was poorly glued together with a weak, unbelievable plot unworthy of a major film producer/director.  The lack of time chronology, the jumping back and forth between scenes wasn't even done well, which is disappointing from Quentin T.  He knows that jumping back and forth in time during scenes can be very effective.  And Quentin knows how to do it very effectively...again, I refer you back to Resevoir Dogs, a brilliant flick where he used devices in a very effective and stirring way.  RD is one of my all-time favorite movies, which is why I am so utterly disappointed by this very cheesy follow-up.  I think QT was even trying to ""give the audience a message about redemption"" when Travolta's little gangster buddy (played by Samuel L. Jackson) 'found God' after all was said and done.  This only drags the film further into the gutter of uselessness.  Resevoir Dogs gave no messages.  It displayed the characters as they were, let you taste the lives of these dirtballs and left you to draw from it what you will.  This flick was riddled with poor writing, unbelievable glitzy plots, unnecessary characters and scenes that served no purpose other than to transparently get certain intended reactions from certain people, the time chronology jumps were poor and not as effective as QT is capable of when he does a good movie.....there are many reasons to wish this flick was never made.  There is some decent acting by some of the involved actors, given the undesirable script.  Harvey Kietel, John Travolta and Bruce Willis all gave decent performmances under the circumstances.  It almost made the movie worth 2 stars, just about, almost.  But, the movie was just so bad!  If you like lots of gangster-related violence, swearing and shock-value fluff with no plot, just a bunch of poorly constructed movie devices haphazardly glued together, you might enjoy this film.  Otherwise.....the hype didn't match the final product.  Sorry, Quentin.  I know that you know how to make a brilliant movie.  This flick was just not up to what your standards should be.  Better luck next time.(I'm adding this after my initial review because I can see I'm already getting negative votes that are obviously coming from people who have already seen the movie and disagree with my assessmemt.  If you haven't seen this fick, don't let these people sway your thinking.  As I said, if you like mindless shock value or are turned on by anything at all that would get a rise out of the faint-hearted or righteous types, you may like this film.  But if like me, you think shock value is great, but only if it is well done, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this film.)"	1.0	utterly disappointing and worthless!	2008-08-27	26	5	21

This movie is sooooooo cool that other people just don't get it. They don't get just how much of a genius Tarantino is. Good God the world is full of so many dumb people! How could they possibly not like 'Pulp Fiction'? I find if impossible that anyone with a brain cell to possibly not like this movie. What is this world coming to? Look at me, I am a Quentin Tarantino fan! I also like other masterworks such as 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', 'Fight Club', and 'Lost In Translation'. What? You say that those movies are boring and pointless too? Man you people are so dumb. You just have no taste of anything meaningful or worthwhile. You people have no use in this world and I feel sorry for you. How could you not possibly sit around and watch a movie and think that it is cool, hence making you hip and cool in the process. You must lead very sad lives, watching movies that are nowhere near as awesome as 'Pulp Fiction'.Look at me, I am a Quentin Tarantino fan. Quentin is going to do an interview on television tonight. I am going to tape it watch it over and over again. Is is just me, or is Quentin the closest thing to GOD on this planet Earth? I am also going to watch 'Pulp Fiction' for over the 50th time tonight.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3PRE5BUL6UZ3A	"""dillhead005"""	This is one brilliant, amazing and well thought out movie in which has everybody interested! Quentin Tarantino impressed us with 'Resevoir Dogs' but Pulp Fiction stunned people. With Tarantinos second (and best) film as a director, he focuses amoung the criminal lives of several stars, such as John Travolta, Samuel l. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Bruce Willis, Eric Sholtz, Rosana Arquette, Ving Rhames, Christpher Walken, Steve Buscimi, and many many other of todays top stars. The main focus is on Vince Vega (Travolta), and Jules (Jackson),in out of order scenes, their hell of a day is shown. In this day blood, sex, drugs, violence, and guns are seen tons of times. And with a Tarantino Film, you never get tired of it. Tarantino himself even played a cameo. This film is stocked with pop cultural references such as what they call a quarter pound with cheese in Amsterdam. But what stunned most people about this film is not its ruthlessness, not its introducing famous stars without a blink, not its drugs, but its unique and exelent filming and story line. If you are one of the 5 people in America who have not seen this masterpiece, go out and rent it...NOW!---Dylan M.	5.0	Pulp Fiction:  Quite possibly the best film ever made.	2002-03-05	0	0	0

Starring * John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken, and Bruce Willis * to name a few. Quentin Tarantino, this is your best work. Almost everything you've done since this has been on the lame side... I'm starting to think you blew your entire load on one movie, and this was it. Great cast, great scenery, great cinematography, great plot, great great great movie. If you haven't seen it, buy it. If you own it, sleep with it.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A24EFU7LU947WL	dimitriweb [this reviewer has been added to t...	The film is supported by an excellent soundtrack . This is a good tip for a little talented director .It is not that the scenes are so poor. They are generally quite fun , and what music!The worst is actually when you try to understand what all this heap tends to prove. People should not engage in banditry because of the real professionals ( who recite bible when they murder other amateurs. )Basically, it would have made a good movie if we just had taken into consideration the first five minutes.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2ILJIPMJXB2L4	DJ JD	This film was entertaining at best. However, it just lacks something that most great films have. Hmmmm.......I wonder what that is......Could it be CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT?Oh, and don't even TRY to tell me that the whole 'Divine Intervention' part with you-know-who is character development. It was just a cheap way for Tarantino to brainwash audiences into thinking there is an actual moral message in the movie. Yes, it was cool that the beginning and the end scenes tie the story together, but think about it......Do you think that a few bullets barely missing a notorious killer are going to convert him into a peaceful man just because he took it as a miracle? If it REALLY meant that much to him, he wouldn't have killed the person who just attempted to kill him. That moment was pretty funny, though. Kind of reminded me of Harry's bad aim in 'Dumb and Dumber'.Now I'll probably have a bunch of crazy Tar-Heads (Tarantino Heads) yapping at me about this movie and that it's a piece of art. Define 'Art' you morons. All most of you can do is call it a masterpiece and leave it at that. Just because something is DIFFERENT and FRESH doesn't make something a masterpiece. There were some extremely dull and dragged out moments in this movie. Perhaps Tarantino should have replaced these scenes with some 'comfortable silence'.However, there are some strong points. Sameul L. Jackson gives an incredible performance in this movie, although the flaw I mentioned earlier lies in Tarantino's stupid idea, not Samuel's acting. There were also some very funny parts, like when Bruce Willis's character is searching for a weapon and keeps on finding a better one until he finally rests his eyes on a samurai sword. And I love how rape victim says he's gonna go 'Medieval' on the rapist. Funny stuff.So is this movie worth a watch? Of course. You'll be entertained if you're not a Tar-Head. However, if you are a Tar-Head, you'll declare this movie as the greatest thing since electricity. And that's just the way it is. Some things will never change.	3.0	Well, I'm sorry Tar-Heads......SPOILER ALERT	2005-10-12	10	2	8

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3ODVYRIERNB4O	D. Marvin	&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is one of those films that is meant to be as much an expression by its artist (Quentin Tarantino) as it is for entertainment. What makes this film unique and not BAD (as some people label its  unorthodox methods) is that it doesn't have to be in perfect chronological  order and doesn't have to waste yards and yards of film on scenes that  explain the story in monotonous detail. It features superb acting, and the  character development is so wonderful that we find ourselves CARING about  drug-addicted, gun-wielding henchmen. This film is best viewed when one can  throw their film prejudice aside and take the movie for what it is: a  classic.	5.0	More art than entertainment	1999-12-02	8	6	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3LWYN3V20KJJA	D McPixel/Vectors	Pulp fiction is one of the best movies ever made, period. The story, the sequence, the characters, the setting....what more could you ask for? Pulp Fiction, like the Godfather series, Scarface, Goodfella's and the Sopranno's deals with the underberlly of society, which is so compelling, and makes most normal people feel good that we don't live the kind of lives portrayed here, but wished we could to some degree experience the sordid scenarios that is the reality of these movies/tv shows, yet be able to walk away unscathed. Pulp Fiction has bad people, good people and bad people that redeem themselves. It shows a cross section of society that is on the outer fringe, yet those who are also out there that are still not beyond redemption, and those willing to stand up to the evil elements that are able to escape what could be their pitfall.The storyline is so rich, the characters so intriguing, that this movie is not only good, but worth 10 viewings to catch some of the subtlties you might miss the first few times. The only reason this film doesn't have a 5 star rating is because some people review it that don't understand it, and therefore slag it, which is unfortunate.	5.0	one of the five best of all time	2003-11-15	2	1	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AORLF6SCDMAUA	"Donovan Reese ""Wunfevteane"""	"First of all, I will not deny this fact for one second: Quentin Tarantino is an ingenious writer. The dialogue he creates is witty, cool, cutting, and incredibly raw. Some of the things his characters say include words you haven't heard in years, words that you discarded back in high school before you went to college because you thought you'd grown up. And yet, even then, it's far from juvenile.His directing style is not glamorous; there's no special effects or pyrotechnics in this film. All Quentin needs is stripped-down camera angles, extended scenes that pan behind walls, shielding the main characters from view, at times (which seems like it's breaking a cardinal rule of filmmaking itself), and fake blood (LOADS of it). Still, even with such little at his disposal, Quentin delivers; in fact, the comparatively basic style of directing fits Quentin's style of storytelling rather well.There, that's my positive. Now, my complaints.While I respect Tarantino's body of work quite a lot, I am, I'm afraid to admit, a bit too traditional when it comes to my favorite films. That's not to say I'm traditionalist, you understand. What I mean to say is that, even though I like films like Memento and Donnie Darko, films that require a few watches to really ""get"", I still like the movie to END where it ENDS.What pissed me off, more than anything in the entire week that I saw Pulp Fiction, was the fact that the movie ends, chronologically, near the beginning of all of the goings on that take place in the film.It's not confusing, mind you. The narration is such that you understand when something is happening. I just think movies should have an ending. Not a happy ending, or even a bloody one, but just an ending, you understand?Truthfully, this chronological mix-up really takes away from what, if correct according to its own time line, would be a fascinating, and completely rewarding film.SPOILERS AHEAD!!The characters are a necessary piece to the Pulp-Fiction-puzzle; if even the most inane character was gone, the movie would feel incomplete, somehow. And, even though the majority of the characters are morally bankrupt, you find yourself cheering for every one of them: you understood Bruce Willis' character, the boxer, and his sense of honor. You felt for Samuel L. Jackson's character, as his near-death experience spurred him to change his life for the better, and as he began to understand the sermon that he recited whenever he had killed someone. I know I did, for I, too, am trying real hard to be the Shephard (lol). You even rooted for John Travolta's character, as he silently pined after Uma Thurman (his employer, the crime bosses's wife), and you were saddened when he died, even though you understood why it had to be.The movie's handful of short stories all come together cohesively by the end, even the one surrounding the two small-time restaurant robbers from the very beginning, as it turns out that John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson are in the restaurant. And, just when you're expecting a bloodbath (it would fit Tarantino's style to shock everybody by killing off the characters that opened the film), Quentin instead takes the opportunity to display some more of his powerful dialogue skills, as Samuel L talks the two out of the path of crime and debauchery that they were beginning to tread.Who knows? Maybe Samuel saw the two ending up like the two hitmen somewhere down the line, and he saw a chance to preempt as much. This would seem a valid stance, considering Travolta's bloody death. You can almost see, even with all of the death and blood, how the film is really speaking out AGAINST a life of crime. And that the strange chronological order of the film's events that I critiqued a few paragraphs ago was necessary to reveal all of the story. If the showdown at the diner had happened in the beginning, we wouldn't have understood it all, now would we?Over time, I've been less upset by the way that the film is narrated, and more intrigued by it. One could even liken it to Hitchcock's more inventive moments. Hitchcock once made a movie with only one camera, the film never cutting between scenes, but instead continuing on, the camera panning and rotating from one scene to the next. Surely this is as imaginative a move as that.All in all, Pulp Fiction is arguably the most innovative of Quentin Tarantino's films, amongst the fairly straightforward narrative of Reservoir Dogs, the 70's action film homage that was Jackie Brown, and the Samurai throwback Kill Bill 1 And 2.That being said, I would have to advise seeing it more than once. Because, you may feel like I did the first time I saw it. ""They can't have the middle of the movie as the ending!!"" you'll say. But, remember, they laughed at Hitchcock, too..."	5.0	Strange, Beautiful film	2005-06-26	5	2	3

He's the type of person you (or I) just want to hang out with. Jackie Brown and Resovoir Dogs were both highly inventive and interesting and all that but this one just pulls ahead. So many intwined stories, it is so not linear and yet sequeanced perfectly to further the movie.

While Quentin Tarantino stays in my mind as one of the strangest individuals in the entertainment business after perhaps Crispin Glover and Michael Jackson, I think his ability to creat a cinematic masterpiece is of the highest level.This movie stands as one of the greatest movies of all time. The intertwining of movie making and storyline are what make this movie so wonderful! Casting was top notch, as well as makeup and costume design. I liked watching the movie, not being sure if I was watching mid-80's or present time. For the record this movie came out in 1992.I think Samuel L. Jackson deserved an oscar nomination for this one. It was phenomenal watching him on the big screen, especially during the shootout in the apartment. I also very much enjoyed the dialogue between him and John Travolta, especially before the shooting, as they are waiting to enter the apartment.I give this high marks, and hope that others will take the time to watch this wonderful movie.Two thumbs up!

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3ECM3FZCLIH8K	dvitoc	This is of course the best film ever made. I own the DVD, but can't understand the shortage of extras. The laserdisc format has plenty of extras. For example it has the tralior and T.V. spots. Behind the scenes,  the Making of Pulp, the Charlie Rose interview with QT, and four deleted  scenes hosted by QT. Why couldn't we get those with the DVD format.  Hopefully in the near future, a re-release of the DVD will include these  goodies and maybe perhaps a Tarantino-Bender commentary track and a  director's cut of the complete film. The current DVD provides average  picture and sound. It is the best movie ever made and gets better each time  you watch it. You will also find out new things every time you view it. For  instance, the gun on Butch's counter didn't belong to Vincent, it belonged  to Wallace. Remember, Jules had already quit. Butch doesn't have any  intention in throwing the fight until Vincent picks a fight with him. It's  true, go back and watch how Butch acts while talking with Wallace and then  how mad he gets when Vincent starts with him.  Plus Fabeine is pregnant in  the movie, listen very closely to what she says. The movie also has a comic  side to it. I think it's funny how Vincent basically caused everything in  the movie. Just think, Vincent caused Mia's overdose by purchasing heroine  from Lance, in the first chapter. In the second chapter, &quot;The Gold  Watch,&quot; Vincent picks a fight with Butch. Then Butch throws the boxing  match. Then in &quot;The Bonnie Situation,&quot; Vincent tells Jules,  &quot;Do you feel like having breakfast?&quot; Then they go to the diner,  and you know what happens. Vincent is the films main character, and without  him there wouldn't have been a movie because he started all the problems.  Ask yourself these questions while viewing this. Why DON'T Vincent and  Jules die in the apartment? Why DO Vincent and Marvin die after  &quot;Devine Intervention?&quot; Why does Jules let Ringo LIVE? Why does  Butch go back to SAVE Wallace's life? What is in the BRIEFCASE? Tarantino  wasn't lazy when writing and directing this film. The more you watch it,  the more likely you'll have the answers to these questions and more. You  need to watch it more than two times to understand it. If you didn't like  it the first time, give it another try. This movie is NOT bad, overrated,  boring or too long like some people say. The actors are great and perfect  for thier roles. Any real movie fan will agree with me. People ask me what  the movie is about and its difficult to say. It's about a lot of things  like honor, pride, luck, faith and redemption.This is my favorite and the  greatest movie ever made!	5.0	Pulp fans demand a better DVD, PUNCHY!	2000-02-09	63	49	14

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2FS0FHBF1N7DQ	Dyers_Eve	The thing that appeals to me the most about this movie is the dialogue, it's quotable, memorable, hilarious and even makes you think. It's hard to believe two hit men would have a discussion about divine intervention and whether a foot massage means something. I've watched this movie countless times over and over again and i still find things i laugh at or missed the previous time. In almost any scene the movie has the quality of trying to figure out how these characters are feeling and the acting is superb. I wish Samuel Jackson had won an award for his performance, he deserved it far more than travolta. Samuel carries every scene he's in and is the glue that holds this great movie together. This movie has classic moments if you don't look closely you'll miss, like watch the look on Jules face when Winston Wolf tells jimmy to make him a cup of coffee. If you not looking in the background you might miss it, this movie is full of things like that and it's definetly a MUst own movie. If you don't own this already buy it from Amazon.com NOW !	5.0	One of the greatest movies ever made	2002-11-29	18	10	8

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ	"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"""Pulp Fiction"" is one of those legendary movies that you're pretty much required to watch, if you consider yourself a movie buff. Instant classic.And while he's gone for over-the-top spectacle in his recent movies, ""Pulp Fiction"" is Quentin Tarantino at his leanest and tightest -- a series of intertwined shorts about boxers, mobsters, thieves and assassins. But despite the dark subject matter, it's a deliciously funny movie with a lot of quotable dialogue and endless pop culture references.But it's also very hard to summarize, because it doesn't really follow a linear narrative. The stories bounce forward and backward in time, only loosely connected by a few important characters. It starts with a pair of professional thieves, ""Pumpkin"" (Tim Roth) and ""Honey Bunny"" (Amanda Plummer) discussing a robbery. Yes, this is actually important, so be patient.Then the narrative switches over to hit men Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta), who chitchat on their way to kill someone and retrieve a mysterious briefcase, on behalf of their gangster boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Soon after, Vincent is ordered to keep Marsellus' wife Mia (Uma Thurman) entertained, but the evening takes a dark turn.Meanwhile, a boxer named Butch (Bruce Willis) is hired by Marsellus to take a dive... but instead he accidentally kills his opponent. When retrieving his heirloom watch from his apartment, Butch ends up running afoul of Marsellus -- only for both of them to end in a horrendous situation in the back room of a pawnshop.Finally (going back to the second subplot), Jules and Vincent's job is derailed by a bizarre shooting that may involve divine intervention. And after a freaky accidental shooting, they end up having to call in an expert to help them avoid any kind of weird attention... which steers them towards an unexpected confrontation.""Pulp Fiction"" isn't a simple watch-it-from-beginning-to-end movie -- the narrative is more a M&ouml;bius strip. The timeline is all over the place, and sometimes it feels more like a string of short films that have been taken apart, rearranged, and given important characters who show up in multiple segments (Marsellus is important in every part).It's also wildly, wickedly funny. Despite all the death, cussing and gruesome injuries, Tarantino presents much of the story in a tongue-in-cheek way -- just consider the scene where Jules and Vincent are forced to strip naked and be given a hose bath, then dressed in goofy casual-wear. How many movies have hit-men chatting about TV pilots, foot massages and quarter-pounders with cheese on their way to kill someone?And yes, the dialogue is absolutely glorious -- witty, tight and funny. Like many Tarantino movies, the characters tend to witter away, but it's surprisingly funny and quotable (""ENGLISH, mother****er! Do you speak it?... Say what again! I dare you! I double-dare you!""). Just don't play a drinking game with all the f-bombs, or you'll be dead before Butch's story is wrapped up.It's hard to single out a single great performance in this movie, because it either made or revived the careers of pretty much everybody in it. Thurman, Roth, Rhames, Plummer, Christopher Walken, Harvey Keitel and the rest all give amazing performances, but my favorites were easily Willis as a desperate boxer with a very special watch, Travolta as a henchman who keeps screwing up, and Jackson as a hotheaded guy who spouts pseudo-Bible verses.""Pulp Fiction"" is one of THE rare movies that deserves its praise -- a pretzel-shaped film overflowing with wit and dark comedy. Definitely a must-see."	5.0	Pulpy delight	2013-04-06	1	1	0

Honest to God, this is a great film and it's really funny as well. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are great together in this one. Along with an All-Star cast of Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Eric Stolts, Tarantino himself, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Bruce Willis, you can't go wrong!This is a definite pick up! There is a lot of swearing in this one and also some drug ise and it's violent too but other than that, a great film and easily out of all of Taratino's movie, PULP FICTION is one of his best!

I believe PULP FICTION is one of those YOU EITHER LOVED IT OR HATED IT movies.  For those of us who have a truly open mind when it comes to movies and are able to stretch the  mind as far as it will go, for those of us who are fans of Tarantino, those  of us who love an original film that has alot of violence, humor, and  probably the best script in motion picture history PULP FICTION is one of  the best, if not THE BEST film of all time.  Forget CITIZEN KANE --  Was  PULP FICTION even on AFI's top 100?  PULP FICTION has got amazingly  talented actors who portray their characters with total perfection and they  all deliver their lines so cool.. so perfectly cool.  The only Oscar that  this movie received was BEST SCREENPLAY, and it definetly deserved that.  It should have been BEST PICTURE.  I think Quentin Tarentino is one of the  best directors, best screenwriters, and he is actually not a bad actor in  the movie.  I truly thank him for coming up with the idea of PULP FICTION  so movie fans like me could have such an amazing piece of celluloid history  to view continously, and quote often, and just plain LOVE.. If you are of  the closed minded, and have to have your movies all be easily laid out for  you beginning to end-- you will hate this movie.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A6KLOBDEJO87J	Ellis Malmgren	"I have yet to see one film that produced such a feeling as that of ""Pulp Fiction"".  Quentin Tarantino is one of, if not the most, brilliant directors of all time.  With Roger Avery by his side, they created a dialogue in Pulp Fiction that left me stunned (oh man I shot Marvin in the face!), breathless (Samuel L. Jackson's gunpoint speech to ringo in the very end), and in laughter tears (when i finished with the towel it didn't look like no G*D D*MN maxi pad!).  Tarantino greatly ties multiple people's lives with crime, money, sex, and drugs, and makes all of them into one. There is no real theme, or main idea in Pulp Fiction, it is just various tales of life, with the pros and cons of everyone's. You just need to watch it, and patience will not be required, because you will feel like you could watch it forever.  This is one of those movies you will never ""get sick of"" or wish you had never spent the money to buy it. The acting is incredible. John Travolta was resurrected. All actors in this became much more popular based on the films gigantic success. Also, one thing i must mention, is the soundtrack.  If you ever tried to think of what good songs to play at any moment, you can never reach any that would fit the corresponding situation. You can tell Tarantino had some part of the music in this film, because it speaks along with him.  That's the greatest thing about him. He...knows the world and people's thoughts better than anyone else. You can distinguish him from all directors, just as you can distinguish Pulp Fiction from any other movie.  And the same goes for Jackie Brown, Reservoir Dogs, etc.(also excellent) films  I would recommend this movie to anyone, but who is intelligent enough to understand its complex foundation, and, well ok, not offended by strong language or violence (but it is not that bad). This movie became a basis for many movies to follow, and it has been called the greatest cult film of all time.  This film truly is a masterpiece. It is incredibly written, acted, and moving. Pulp Fiction is my favorite movie of all time, and it will not be soon forgotten as a classic to the worldwide public."	5.0	A Pure Masterpiece	2003-05-19	2	1	1

However, Resivoir Dogs is what really got the ball rolling for Tarantino and for me will remain my favorite of all his films.  Pulp Fiction has mass appeal, which to me is great, but I can't hold it as close to my heart as Dogs, cause it just isn't as gritty.  Don't get me wrong though, there is grit...just not as much as Dogs or even Jackie Brown.  And if there's one thing Tarantino knows, it's grit.  Just look at Natural Born Killers, or True Romance, those are gritty.  This is superb though, and remains one of the best films since it's release.  This DVD is a no-brainer for fans of this film.  It has all the extras you could want and then some.  If you own the first no fills disc, time to update.

Creative plot layout along with actors such as John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson is what makes Pulp Fiction great.  Pulp fiction has an un-sequential time line that won't leave you feeling lost.  Basically you have three different stories throughout the film. You have two hit men (Travolta and Jackson), Two Crazy robbers (Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth) and a mentally troubled boxer (Bruce Willis). You will laugh, cringe and be amazed during the over dramatic situations these characters come across. Weird scenes do arise at times but that's Tarentino's style. Don't let that give you a bad preconceived judgement. I highly recommend this film to anyone over seventeen.	5.0	UNIQUE ARTWORK	2001-11-28	2	1	1

Some movies are great because of the acting, some because of the story, some because of the cinematography.  This movie is great because of the dialogue, and it's awfully hard to appreciate the dialogue and how it builds up the plot and tension in the movie the first time through.Why is Vincent (Travolta) so upset when Marsellus's wife Mia(Thurman) OD's on his heroin?  Because of the exchange that he had with Jules (Jackson) about the guy who Marsellus threw out of a four-story window because he massaged Mia's feet (which we actually find out later was actually just a handshake).  Vincent can only imagine what Marsellus will do to him if Mia dies.The dialogue builds on itself and creates the environment which the characters live in.  The characters almost never talk *about* what's happening, so the dialogue runs perpendicular to the story.  But it still ties the different elements together.You need to watch this movie at least twice to appreciate it.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	APX9B5RSL81YJ	Explorer	So few movies do I absolutely love and this is one of them.  Truly this is in my top 5 favorite films.I have watched this movie countless of times and every time, I see something new that I missed on the previous viewing.  So much is going on, yet one is not lost and that is a feat in itself which shows you how great this movie is...  How great Tarantino is....Anyway, if one is not put off by violence or cursing/foul language then this movie along with its dark humor will appeal to you....Samuel Jackson and John Travolta along with the other actors were tops in this movie...Yeah...  Great Movie!!Highly Recommend this movie, especially now that it is offered in this two disc collectors edition for those who have yet to see this film....	5.0	WUV THIS FILM!!!!	2009-09-23	0	0	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2T0XBQM7N923Y	Fady Ghaly	The film that not only resurrected an aging genre but also put John Travolta back on the map and formally established Samuel L. Jackson as a superstar (who prior to his partaking in the film, was chiefly just another extra), Pulp Fiction, like Quentin Tarantino's earlier hit, Reservoir Dogs, featured some absorbing dialogue by Quentin Tarantino himself and Roger Avary that's frequently off the wall but funny, and stupendous performances by an all-star cast in this memorable melodrama that weaves together three interrelated stories regarding small-time hoods, drug-attics, boxing champions on the verge of death's door, and hazardous criminals that are the last thing you'd ever want to have to deal with, as Tarantino clearly shows in one of his stories which feature Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames as the key characters. The mode of the film is to imply such characters in sticky circumstances, and then let them evade into even stickier ones, which is how Willis's and Rhames's character wind up together as the captives of strange leather freaks in the basement of a gun shop. Or how, in the opening sequence, Tim Roth's and Amanda Plummer's character, a couple of stick-up artists, get in way over their heads. Much of the action in the film comes under the heading of crisis control.If the circumstances are adept and original, then as is the dialogue. Nowadays, many films use flat, functional speech: The characters merely say enough to advance the story line. But the ones in Pulp Fiction are completely in love with words for their own sake.With Tarantino's trademark profanity and casual violence, he shifts between humor and graphic violence that inspired a seemingly endless slew of imitators, none of which have, however, made a picture as powerful as this one, for it is bound to become a cult favorite!	5.0	Fady Ghaly's reviews	2001-09-24	3	2	1

A couple of scenes are shot through different points of view to  make a lot of audience go &quot;Hey isn't that that guy over there in the  background.&quot;  This movie is realistic in terms of drugs (Tarantino did  his research).  If you want to see a movie with an interesting story line,  this is it.  If you are looking for action, try &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;  by Tarantino.	5.0	Original	2000-01-02	0	0	0

They'll look at you as a complete weirdo for not seeing this "" masterpiece "" and will end up telling you the whole thing scene by scene. Crack up, laugh at hilarious it seems. I've watched the movie once and I've never been more bored in all my life. If this was the pinnacle of 90s film-making then I'm glad I didn't see it when it came out ( I'm glad I was too young ). It's boring, sleep-inducing and not one bit funny save one scene from Christopher Walken. It's also rather empty which is not how I like films to be. It also feels like Tarantino just cutting everything he loved about the type of movies he loved and then pasted them together with nothing original to show for it. Oh the post modern touch - it's so original! Correction it's pathetic. Having tried to watch some of the other stuff he's directed I can't help but think that he makes really shallow films. They all seem to follow a set pattern which is extremely infuriating.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A29QA79VLQGHY6	Flipper Campbell	"When ""Pulp Fiction"" first made it onto DVD, the disc's images had all the charm of an over-inked Dick Tracy strip, garish and pummeled by artless contrast. This criminal neglect is avenged -- and then some -- by Miramax's terrific two-disc release of ""Pulp Fiction: Collector's Edition.""A lot of the ""Pulp"" extras appeared on Criterion's laserdisc, though a few recent interviews are cut in. Those seeking Quentin Tarantino's take on his work and cinema in general have plenty to chew on. Some of the most interesting and coherent material comes on a pre-""Jackie"" interview by Charlie Rose that appears on ""Pulp."" DVD-ROM links that lead to script/movie comparisons. The script viewer's version of ""Pulp"" includes scenes taken out during editing, as they would have appeared. Travolta does a lot of stunting with his lines, but they still come out Tarantino.""Pulp's"" outtakes are less compelling, mostly chatter cut for quality reasons. On-the-set footage includes the shooting of Travolta's big twist-contest number with Thurman, adding a few moments of music and dance to the delicious scene. Just off camera, Tarantino twists along to Chuck Berry's ""You Can Never Tell.""The celebrated soundtrack to ""Pulp"" sounded OK on the original DVD; here it's elevated into audiophile territory. Dick Dale's pipeline guitar gives shivers; a cover of one of Neil Diamond's old hits erects a wall of sound. ""Pulp"" audio options are DTS and Dolby Digital, but the mix is mostly stereo, with some tasty reverb echoes from the rear now and then.""Pulp's"" video transfer takes a while to reveal its finesse, but the images are rich in leather-booth reds and shell-shock whites.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1XOZW9A8TL7JY	Four Star Film Fan	Starring a cast including John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis, this crime film tells the somewhat inter-related stories of these four main characters. Travolta and Jackson are a pair of hit men who have several adventures having to do with retrieving a briefcase, disposing of a dead body, and eating breakfast at a diner. Separately, Travolta has a somewhat harrowing outing watching the wife of his boss (Thurman). Willis on the other hand does not throw the boxing match he was suppose to. Thus, he finds himself in hiding with his lover, facing his own set of problems. I do have to say this film was interesting because of the nonlinear format almost like chapters. The eclectic pop culture references were classic along with some of the dialogue. However, it gets tiring listening to the strong language and a scene or two are worth skipping in my mind.	4.0	Pulp Fiction (1994)	2013-06-01	0	0	0

"Is it possible that something so loathsome and awful could actually be adored and lauded by millions of people? Is it only a matter of chance that some movies are loved and others hated, regardless of their content? I hope this is true, because I cannot believe that there is actually anything good about the movie Pulp Fiction to lead any sane, reasoned, drug-free person to write the glowing comments that surround mine, much less the oodles of people who actually handed over their money to see this thing.Why is this movie so bad, you ask? Okay, I'll tell you, even though it's like pointing out that windows are transparent. Starting with the script, I see no reason to be impressed by an assemblage of overly stylistic dialogue and flat, boring characters. There is nothing amazing about two guys talking about French McDonald's restaurants, and then killing some guys. Every awful stretch of dialogue is dragged out as long as it will last, and then some. It's as if Tarantino said to himself ""I think I can cram one more line about milkshakes in here"". You have to give him credit for padding the film in ways that nobody's ever tried before. The actors look as though they're doing their best to salvage this turkey (and they are talented), all the while knowing in the back of their minds how much of a cow pie the whole thing is. As far as Tarantino's directorial style is concerned, he should just get himself a career in Nike commercials because that's where his talent level cuts off."	1.0	One-dimensional modernist pap (minor spoilers)	2010-11-29	29	9	20

As far as standard version dvds go this is as good as it gets although it'll be very interesting to see how the Blu-ray version will eventually look like.No one tells a story as entertainingly and as uniquely in-your-face as Tarantino and this blackest of comedies is for me his very best work.  In lesser hands a tale told as disjointedly and with little care for chronology as this one does would fall flat on its face but fortunately for us the hands are Tarantino's.  There are many great performances here but surely Jackson's and Travolta's stand out.  I also thought Walken's brief contribution was extremely humorous and worthy of honourable mention as well.Shocking audiences upon its initial release I did find it interesting that the overall moral is still about hope for even the worst of the worst as they either find redemption after a life-changing experience e.g. Jackson or death/trauma (Travolta/Rhames)for their crimes and even the underdog has his day (Willis).  Despite the graphic violence and in-your-face vice the ending still seems to suggest good triumphs over evil in the end in true Hollywood fashion.Very unique, enjoyable and certainly a classic that should continue to age very well.Recommended!	5.0	Tarantino's Best Has Just Gotten Even Better!	2009-08-10	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2BPDFR58H9575	Galina	"I love ""Pulp Fiction"". I loved it when I saw if for the first time back in 1994 with my then 13-year old son in the theater, and I loved it again when I saw it last weekend on TV. Every time I see it, it seems to get better and better. I am fascinated by the incredible pace, witty dialogs, and brilliant writing - every piece of the puzzle falls in the right place, and in the end I don't care a bit about the mysterious case. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a glorious example of the fact that there is no low subject for Art. The great Russian poet Anna Akhmatova said in one of her poems:""Imagine that sometimes, without shame,Poems like flowers grow from trash.""It is amazing how a work of art can consist of so many trashy elements, which is alluded to in the title of the film. It is populated by characters that came from the pages of cheap ""pulp fiction"" novels - gangsters, philosophical hit men, drug addicts and drug dealers, dangerous and sensual mistresses, naive girlfriends, crooked prizefighters with hurt prides and prized golden watches with long and deep histories. Tarantino and his co-writer Roger Avary took the clich&eacute;s of hundreds of films, comic books and twenty-five-cent paperbacks and by magic of their talents turned them into something fresh, sparkling, clever, funny and incredibly enjoyable. I should mention Tarantino's taste for music - the soundtrack for ""Pulp Fiction"" (as for all of his films) is just killer. And last but not least - how well Tarantino works with his actors, in this film everybody shines. There are no bad performances in ""Pulp Fiction"". For me, it is a perfect film and a true source of joy, one that I've experienced dozens of times and am always ready for again.I've read many times that ""Tarantino is a rip-off artist"", that ""he takes bits and pieces (not influences) from other movies."" I often think of him as of a young boy who loves to play with his toys. For him, the toys are the old movies that he adores and he brings his love and admiration of these films to his own work. He is not greedy; he invites us to share his love, to play together, to have as much fun watching his films as he did while making them. Tarantino does not make profound statements or ask eternal questions, but what he does do is entertain, and he does it marvelously - with style, class, irony, wit, and talent. When I am in the presence of a great work of art I know the feeling, and Tarantino's film is a great work of art that happened to be very enjoyable. I cannot resist. Like any time of day is a good time for blueberry pie, any time of day and any day of the week is a good time to watch and enjoy ""Pulp Fiction""."	5.0	He will strike down upon us with great style, class, irony, wit, and talent.	2007-01-30	6	3	3
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I	"GameraRocks ""captpicardfan"""	Even thought Reservoir Dogs got him noticed in the States, it was this film that really made everyone see that a genius story writer and director had been born. Always paying homage to the kinds of films he grew up with, Quentin comes through with Pulp Fiction. A brilliant story about two worn out hit men that are basically tired of their jobs, at least one of them is. The side-story of the Boxer who has a bounty on his head for not throwing the fight is equally as interesting of a story.Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman...the list goes on about how many great actors and actresses are in this film. If the characters aren't believable, the movie is a bust and not good, but each did a great job at fitting their roles perfectly. The acting added a lot to the well written story. There is even a cameo by QT himself in the film. I don't know. This film is so great; it's hard to put into words on how great it is. Words don't really do it justice; it has to be seen to be believed. You will love this movie if you haven't seen it already. It's definitely one of the best films to come out of the 90's.	5.0	A Movie That Has To Be Seen To Be Believed	2006-05-18	2	2	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A391UWNYC7K7JS	"Gary Gardner ""Your resident dillettante"""	First of all, I viewed this film primarily because it was a 1998 American Film Institue Top 100 Movies of all Time winner. I was expecting it to blow my socks off. The fact is, it did not. However, I didn't despise it as much as I thought I would, either. Discussing the overall film: It is no doubt a groundbreaker, insomuch as the format of seemingly unrelated vignettes start to coalesce as the film progresses. John Travolta's career was resurrected, playing a hit man named Vincent, who is teamed up with co-worker Jules (Samuel L. Jackson). A series of mishaps and bad fates confront the duo as they set about their odious tasks, with black humor that, at times, is too edgy. Bruce Willis plays the tough guy boxer who runs afoul of Vince's and Jules's boss, Marcellus (Ving Rhames); it is classic Willis, for sure, but the actor faces no new territory here. Uma Thurman is alluring as Marcellus' girlfriend. She is instrumental in the movie's most sickening part, as she overdoses on cocaine, and Vince (who has taken her out for a night on the town) must inject her with a stimulant in the chest to revive her. The starkness of the movie...the apparent shock value...no doubt accounts for its now-cult-like following. However, the language is appalling, and &quot;Pulp...&quot; is peppered throughout with various four-letter words. Hard to believe, then, that this film was nominated for best screenplay at the Oscars! There's no question that some of the dialogue is at times witty, but this does not make it a contender for best screenplay. Now, the DVD itself. I was shocked at how grainy the picture was, particularly when the zoom is initiated. Surely, a 1994 motion picture can have better quality visually than, say, &quot;Ben Hur&quot; or &quot;Lawrence of Arabia!&quot; Also, don't expect any extras, because there aren't any; it is just simply the movie. If you really enjoy this film, you may want to consider holding out for a special edition, or at least one that is remastered.  I give it three stars, because the vignettes were cleverly arranged, and some of the stories were interesting. The cast is great too (other than Amanda Plummer, who really could have used the work in Lee Strasberg's acting class); truly, she was just plain annoying, and she turns in a really hideous performance. I'm no prude, but the constant use of the &quot;f-word&quot; was tiresome and trivial. The meek and squeamish should avoid &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; as they would leprosy. This is vintage Tarantino, who also turns up as a friend of Jules: lots of vulgar language, drug use, and racism abound, but at least he set a new standard formatically. To sum up, not a bad film. A classic worthy of inception in A.F.I.'s Top 100 list? Not a damn chance. A more worthy candidate would have been &quot;The Shawshank Redemption.&quot; However, that film was criminally overlooked by the various cognoscenti chosen to compile this list. Oh well...just like Tarantino's stark and dehumanizing landscape, life is not always fair or easy. One final aside: Why is it that every time I see anti-gunner Tim Roth in a movie, he's always armed to the teeth? Can we say......HYPOCRISY???	3.0	Decent film, but highly overrated	2001-08-27	3	1	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1RJJ56MBJMX87	Gavin Wilson	First viewing of any Tarantino movie is a scary, gross-out fest for 99% of the population. Unless you've already heard about the plot, you never know how horrific it's going to be. As the 18 certificate confirms, this is not for children: the language is appalling, much of the imagery makes violence and drug-taking seem cool, and there are scenes of sado-masochistic male sex.Not a single law-abiding cop is seen in the film -- the only thing preventing the hoodlums from doing precisely what they like is other hoodlums. None of the characters displays any regret over their killing.That said, there is intense, visceral drama in many of the scenes, it's nicely edited, there are some great speeches, and much of the music fits in superbly. But if this is civilisation, give me antiquity any day.	3.0	Comic-book anti-heroes for hardcore adults	2004-04-07	10	4	6
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A47V1VCGSA6P5	"G. Crofford ""Travis 76"""	"Fans adore it for it's entertainment, other people hate it for it's brutality, and critics praise it for it's feriosity.It's understandable why the film is so loved and it is also understandable why it is so disliked by others.However there is more to ""Pulp Fiction"" than what meets the eye. It's really a story of uncertain paths and redemtion told in a sadistic way. Not only that but it is somewhat a tribute to older films and an example of export photography.One good piece of photography in the film is when John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson get out of the elevater about 15 minutes into the film, there is a longshot that lasts about 2 1/2 minutes, then when they enter their victims rooms there is a seriese of very short shots, forshadowing that tension is about to arise.A well known fact about the film is that most of the violence is offscreen. The same technique was used thirty-four years earlyer in the shower scene in ""Psycho,"" the camera only showed the sequences leading up to the stabbs. The images are all seen in the imagination, and the imagination can show far more violent images that what any film can.The stories of three men is basically what the film is about. Two of the men are caught at a crossroad in there life and the other meets his end.Butch (Bruce Willis), is a boxer whome is payed to purposly lose a fight, yet he is a boxer with dreams and wants to rise to the top but doesn't make it, and whom he is being payed by is Marcellus Wallace, a big, tall man with a bandaid on the back of his neck, it is said that the devil enters your body through the back of your neck, in other words Mr. Wallace is the devil. If Butch stages this fight, it is his life he is throwing away, so matephorically speaking he is sailing his soul to the devil. Yet when the time of the fight comes Butch come to a revelation, actually a flash back, when he is presented a gold watch which had been passed down from generation to generation, and ironically had been worn in the past three majore wars America had been involved in, it is realized now that Butch is fighting a war of his own with Wallace and he can't give up without a fight (the man he is fighting is named Wilson, the same name of the boxer whome Marlon Brando purposely lossed a fight for in ""On the Waterfront""). When  Butch not only wins the fight, but also kills his opponent, Wallace is out to kill Butch who must get out of town before he is found.Before he gets out of L.A. once again he crosses paths with Marcellus Wallace and they're on a rampage which lands them in a pawn shop where they are both held at gun point and tied up, Marcelluse is brought out and abused (it seems at the this point, who was once the devil is now humanized). While still tied up yet under little supervision, Butch soon escapes and is about to make a run for it until he has second thoughts about what to do, he kills one of the abusers  and saves the life of Marcellus, with that his life is spared and he is redeemed. He rides a motorcycle (or chopper) back to his loved one. On the chopper it says grace, meaning the grace of God that delivers him from evil.Another story of irony is between two hitmen: Vincent (John Travolta) & Jules (Samuel L. Jackson). When They have a close call with death themselves, Jules takes it as a sign from God to stop going down the path that they are going down, yet Vincent takes it as an amazing coincidance nothing more. Jules quites his job yet Vincent continues, in which he meets his end soon enough."	5.0	Sadistic, brutal, humorouse, thought provoking...	2004-08-13	3	2	1
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3ACZ7UFFFCDHA	GDAWG	The movie was actually pretty good but i expected more from the reviews i had heard.  It had an all star cast that included John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, and Quentin Tarantino himself.  I thought that the dialogue for the movie was outstanding.  But there was no need for as much drug use as they showed.  Ok, show Mia snorting once, we understand that shes an addict, they dont have to show it 3 times.  But overall the movie was pretty good, and you should see it but leave the kids with the babysitter.	4.0	I expected more	2003-04-05	2	0	2
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2IUOJVG32WJOR	Geebus	Quentin Tarantino seems like one of the biggest f@#k-sticks in Hollywood.  He always cameos in his films - playing the weed that he most likely is in real life - and loves putting so much apparent drivel into the dialogue that you wonder if you're watching an R-rated Seinfeld episode.  Yet the bulk of the actors he chooses to deliver these sermons are so charismatic and talented that you're still thoroughly entertained while waiting for a point, if indeed one exists.  And when that point invariably emerges it's full of unmistakable insight and humour, which makes it all worthwhile.So as much as I'd like to, I can't deny him the bulk of the credit for some great films, and Pulp Fiction stands out as my personal favourite.	5.0	Undeniable	2002-04-30	1	0	1

For some of these scenes what the heck was the point?The most glaring case in point for me was the whole Zed/Butch/Mahshalus sex scene.  Now why was this scene even in the movie?

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1FS9R0JXHLHEG	George Annessa	This ground breaking movie has been endlessly discussed, praised, damned, ripped off and copied so many times that you can easily lose sight of the fact that what you have here is a genuinely original, exciting and important work of art that when experienced for the umpteenth time STILL never fails to thrill and amuse.This movie is one of the few I would describe as perfect. I honestly cannot fault a thing about it. The brilliant dialogue has become legendary, the elliptical structure of the script has been much imitated and will continue to do so. The fantastic group of actors, who range from has-beens (at the time) to cult favourites, are all uniformly excellent, and the soundtrack is one of the coolest and most eclectic ever assembled. In short, this is a modern classic, and required viewing for all movie fans. 'Pulp Fiction' is as good as any movie you care to name.

So, the movie alone gets 4-5 stars...But that is not what this comment is about. The DVD package as a whole was a sad disappointment. There were no trailers for Pulp Fiction (I remember one being very good and worth including). On one videocassette version, there was a section dedicated to cut scenes (one cut scene was Mia interviewing Vincent on their first meeting) which is a staple of DVD's in general. But not this one. How can you let a video show up a DVD? This would have been the perfect movie to have a director's running commentary, to give his motivation and ideas about his film. That too is absent.If you are not into the extras, then this DVD will be just fine for you. But I want other possible purchasers to be wary of what they are getting into and understand what exactly they are buying (I wish that I had done more research). The manufacturers may try to pull the same trick they did with Animal House and Conan The Barbarian: release a version quick and dirty, then release an extras-rich version some time later.(Note: this was before they released the new DVD with all the cool extras.)	1.0	Loved the movie, disappointed by the DVD	2001-02-23	35	12	23
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1WHD5924BAJHY	G.

We hear about the re-emergence of John Travolta as a sleeping giant of an actor, the remarkable performance of Samuel Jackson, and what can only be described as borderline idolatry for Quentin Tarantino etc.. We hear about all the extras (interviews, behind the scenes stuff etc.) that appear on the DVD and then there's the sound track, but no one ever bothers to convey to us what the movie meant to them!What, if anything, is the message here? I have been watching movies, foreign films included, for forty years and I wouldn't add this DVD to my library if you gave it to me for free.I can only say that when some call this  a 'great' movie, I have absolutely no idea what they mean.	2.0	What is this movie about ?	2006-03-09	16	4	12

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A10L8O1ZMUIMR2	G. Kleinschmidt	I finally saw this movie for the first time last night and, wow. I've always heard so much hype about this movie like people getting offended, and people falling in love with it. It's just simply a love it or hate it type of film. There isn't that much action, but there's so much blood that it makes up for the lack of action. It would be very hard to determine the catergory of this movie...if you think about it, it's a dark comedy, but also a drama, and also an action, but also an epic...AHH. It's funny in a twisted way and uses what hit men talk about before they kill to stir up laughs. The soundtrack is explosive as almost all surf guitar. After watching it, I thought about how this movie had no plot. But I realized that it was 4 or so stories mashed together in one, sort of like Magnolia. This movie is not for the faint of heart, innocent blood spraying everywhere...most of it is presented comical. There is so much bad language and racial slurs that it just adds to the film's ruthlessness. The DVD is quite good, one of the best I've seen next to the fat four disc extended edition of the Lord Of The Rings. If you love the movie, get the Collector's Edition because it really is very cool. One of my favorite scenes is the whole thing with Butch going back to the apartment to get the watch and the incident that happnes there, and then more on the streets and the shop. So many memorable scenes in the movie, no wonder why it's on AFI's top 100 greatest movies ever made list. This movie's a real thinker with out-of-order scenes and hard situations. So if you are willing to let yourself get caught up in a profane, gory, disturbing, yet comical concauction of a movie, I suggest you see this now!	5.0	Five Dollar Milkshake	2002-12-31	3	1	2
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2KVQFD2ZWRGOZ	Glenn Canning	When Quentin Tarantino made Reservoir Dogs, it gave him a firm start. When 1994 rolled around, he gave us this, which let everyone know who he was. This movie, without a doubt, is one of the best movies to ever grace the silver screen. Any aspect that is looked upon shines with a golden glow, not unlike the mysterious breifcase shown in the film.Acting beyond perfection, editing that will make your head spin, a script that runs circles around almost all others, direction that should be studied forever, and a soundtrack that you will either buy or download shortly after hearing it all combine to make a truly sublime experience.The story consists of three stories that dance around each other throughout the film. One is about a hitman Vicent Vega (played to perfection by John Travolta, reheating his then cold career) that takes out (it's not a date!) his boss's (a brilliant Ving Rhames) wife (Uma Thurman). The dialog between these two characters is truly amazing, especially at the dinner table. The second story is about a boxer, Butch (Bruce Willis), and the aforementioned boss, Marselus Wallace, and their agreement of Butch taking a dive in his next fight in exchange for a hefty sum. There is brialliance to be found here also, specifically in the internal conflict in Butch on whether or not he should return to the basement of a pawn shop and save Marselus from a variatable hell. The third story involves Vincent, the comical Jules (a chilling Samuel L. Jackson), a hilarious character named Jimmie (played by Quentin Tarantino himself), and a problem solver, Winston Wolf (Harvey Keitel). This act is an emotional releif from the previous two, while still staying sharp.If you havent seen this movie, please do, as you will see a remarkable film. This movie is not for everyone, specifically children, as it contains a plentifull portion of profanity, a considerable ammount of violence, and perverse sexual situations. Those taboo only fuel this beautiful movie though, and should not be seen as a deterrent, rather as a warning.This award winning film is truly a masterpeice in every sense of the word, so do yourself a favor and if you have not, see it.	5.0	A True Masterpeice	2004-02-06	3	0	3

The performances are all magnificent.  The multi-story scenario is intruiging and becomes much  easier to grasp upon second and third viewings.  But the real reason this  film is so well liked and critically appreciated has to be because of the  incredible dialogue.  It is truly one of the best and most daring scrips in  contemporary American movie history.  The screenplay certainly deserved the  Academy Award, and is itself well worth purchasing.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A18RBRV5S99XD8	GRAHAM TOMLINSON	I suppose I should apologise to the vast majority for what is about to follow (though I have no regrets) as my viewpoint on this movie is generally scorned. I give it one star for Samuel L. Jacksons amusing  performance, another for being audacious. Not good, however, merely  audacious. There have only been two occasions where I have felt like  walking out during a cinema presentation, the latter being due to  &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; making me feel nauseous at one point(though  this is a compliment to realism, in what was a very good movie), the other  through a distinct problem in staying awake during this movie (and no I was  not excessively tired). I have seen hundreds of movies and am not averse to  flashbacks in the least, but this was just preposterous. Ok some films  start at the end then the remainder is flashback, so if the lead character  dies at the start you accept the film will then build up to this point to  explain the hows and whys. Pulp Fiction niether starts nor finishes with  the lead character, but introduces him a short way in, flashes back,  forward and sideways, kills him off in the MIDDLE, then expects you to  retain interest in him with further flashbacks in the second half. On top  of this, the Bruce Willis character is introduced late, and proceeds to  send you into a soporific state of boredom. Whilst I concede he does also  appear in the films one compelling scene, I cannot see how his performance  was so highly rated. Personally I feel a lot of hype was built around the  injection through the heart scene, although the build up to this, with  Travolta and Thurman in a club, had virtually sent me to sleep anyway, and  why people consider this whole portion to be cinematically magnificent is  quite beyond me. Jackie Brown was simply stunning, this was simply nothing  (apart from irritating).	2.0	&quot;Overrated&quot; gets a significant meaning!	1999-06-12	74	17	57

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2UYAFQ40U2PHS	"Grigory's Girl ""GR"""	"Kevin Smith said that it is important to make a distinction between Pulp Fiction the PHENOMENON, and Pulp Fiction, the actual film.  Now, there may have been a little professional jealousy here, but not really.  Smith's point is very well taken.  10 years have passed on by, and I have finally decided to revisit Pulp Fiction.  When it was released, myself (and every human in existence) was told that it was, indeed, one of the greatest artistic works to ever be committed to celluloid.  Looking back on this ""masterpiece"", we were all hoodwinked, bamboozled, robbed, emasculated, etc., etc..  This film is mediocre at best.  It isn't horrible, but it is average.  Much of the ""Tarantinoesque"" dialogue is actually lame, and some of the ""brilliant"" scenes (like Harvey Keitel's scene) are actually silly and very underwhelming.  Keitel's scene treats his character like a genius, this brilliant fix it man.  All he really does is tell Travolta and Jackson to get some cleaning supplies, scrub the car top to bottom, clean the blood off of themselves, and drop the car at a junkyard.  Translated, this means ""when you make a mess, clean it up quickly and neatly"".  NOT the most amazing thing I've ever heard.  A lot of the characters are smug and full of themselves, a characteristic of the 1990's, where people and characters would act like a---holes, and say they were just being ""ironic"".  There's nothing ""ironic"" about being a selfish, smug a---hole.  The film's structure of telling the story out of chronological order is not shockingly innovative.  It's been done before, and much better, in Kubrick's The Killing, Clint Eastwood's Bird, and, in the best example, Leone's magnificent Once Upon a Time in America (the uncut version).  The violence is not especially shocking, and the characters are very shallow.  So, overall, a decent film, but a much overhyped one.  The 90's was the decade of ""hype"" (to quote the name of a documentary on the grunge music scene), and they hyped many films as well, and this is the greatest example of that.  If you wish to see Tarantino's best film, watch Reservoir Dogs.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3OHB78Y7L7ZK	GSD	Every now and again a film comes along that changes the way we as people look at movies. Pulp Fiction is one of those films. It is a visceral experience that is part exploitation film and part noir epic. Upon its release it managed to accomplish its success almost completely by word of mouth. Much less a statement about where society was in the 1990's, this film is more about how moviemaking had changed and evolved up to that point.With an all star cast (John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman), this movie grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go. At its heart it is an action film but, like True Romance and Reservoir Dogs before it, it hints at the exploitation films of the 1960's, 70's and 80's that the majority of people even today have not experienced. It is a great movie that, on an $8 million budget, made Tarantino a household name.Pulp Fiction packs so much energy and invention into telling its interwoven short stories (all about temptation, corruption, and redemption amongst modern criminals, large and small) it leaves viewers wanting more.	5.0	One of the greatest films of all time!	2012-12-17	1	1	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A387XCVR145N9J	G. Taylor	"I will start this review by explaining all the reasons my mother would never watch this movie. First off, it's extremely violent, with ears flying and blood everywhere. Secondly, the language would be generally unacceptable in public places. Third, the drugs, sex, and general evil happenings throughout the film.That said, having seen this movie at a young age, those were all the things I loved about it. But now that I'm older and have gotten past the giggling stage of hearing the ""F"" word 281 times, I respect the deep story, the character interaction, and the cinematography.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AFO0HO8BYO4X5	Guido Franco	I would advise anybody intending to see PULP FICTION, to reflect carefully about it's title, and the explanations given by the author at the beginning of the film. This is NOT a film about real people, because most probably  Quentin Tarantino does not know more than we do, about mobsters, mafia  characters and the like. This is a film about fictional movie characters,  in the same way &quot;Breathless&quot; (Godard, 1957) was a film inspired  by American movies. Godard had never met a little gangster, I'm quite sure  about that. There is not much else to say about PULP FICTION. A nice  exercise in film making, perfect acting by Samuel Jackson (he deserves an  Oscar), Harvey Keitel, Bruce Willis and John Travolta, some funny dialogues  from Tarantino, a lot of violence, and that's it. The &quot;complicated  screenplay&quot; is not complicated at all, it does probably not exist,  even in the mind of the director, and does not need to exist either. The  best scene is the last, it has some redeeming values, and succeeds to save  not only the character, but the film itself.	3.0	Nice exercise in film making	1999-08-29	2	1	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A10KS1CH8L5XD2	Hadi	director Quentin Tarantino revisits the seedier side of Los Angeles--following 1992's RESERVOIR DOGS--with this funny, violent, tongue-in-cheek tribute to the less &quot;classic&quot; side of filmmaking--the potboilers and capers, the Blaxploitation flicks and gangster movies. The film interweaves three tales, told in a circular, fractured manner, which only fully connect by the time the final credits roll. The first story focuses on Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), two hit men on duty for &quot;the big boss,&quot; Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), whose gorgeous wife, Mia (Uma Thurman), takes a liking to Vincent. In the second, a down-and-out pugilist (Bruce Willis), who is ordered to take a fall, decides that there's more money in doing the opposite. The final chapter follows a pair of lovers (Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth) as they prepare to hold up a diner.Tarantino wears his cinematic influences proudly, bringing them to life in the ironically hip, self-referential 1990s. The result is a work that changed the face of independent cinema forever, making it a legitimate player in the Hollywood mainstream. The all-star cast steps into their roles with obvious glee, and Tarantino once again uses his soundtrack to up the &quot;cool&quot; ante yet another notch, making for a motion picture event that has worked its way into our national vernacular.	5.0	The comic storyline only tarentino can create	2004-04-13	5	2	3

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A25FDX17O3QKLT	Hallstatt Prince	This movie is a joy from start to finish and established Quentin Tarantino as the modern Orson Wells of independent film. Right from it start of the first few minutes of this movie we know we have stumbled on to something new. The movie starts with two of our best living odd ball character actors (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) playing respectively Pumpkin and Honey Bunny seeming to be a normal couple love struck couple sitting in a diner where we eavesdrop on their conversation. A normal scene except they are matter of factly talking about stick up jobs. After pleasantries and plotting they kiss. Sweet Honey Bunny jumps on the table waving a gun spewing the foulest of obscenities.The loud blare of speed guitars play and the credits roll. This is not going to be your average ride.The movie is made up of several distinct out of sequence stories that in the end become connected.Is it a violent movie? It sure is. But the over the top language and violence is one of the tools used by this artist. Art through out the ages is no stranger to the violent and the erotic.  And for a moment let's talk about the violence. For those few individuals on the planet that have not seen the movie but heard some of the mindless denunciations you would think this was a nonstop autopsy. There were in fact many more graphically violent movies before Pulp Fiction came along. And I would not say the movie is graphicly violent. Its air of violence comes more from what is implied, not seen, and the tension.The two main characters are Vincent (played by John Travolta) and Jules (played by Samuel L. Jackson) who are witty wisecracking cold hearted hit men. And it is with them that the movie really begins. The witty lines, the playful banter between characters and the absurd (albeit sometimes horrific) situations in this movie really give it its charm and the nonstop action give it all of the excitement of a roller-coaster ride.There is an incredibly meticulous attention to detail in this movie and this really stands out in the sets and the soundtrack. This movie was obviously a labor of love and if you can get over the violence and obscenities you will see the movie as being joyous in an odd sort of way. It is  definitely a movie you want to own as every time you see it you will see something new.There are several McGuffins used in this movie such as the mysterious case Vincent and Jules are sent to retrieve and a gold watch an over the hill boxer must likewise retrieve. As a movie buff Tarantino has assimilated all that he has learned from his favorite movies and added some new twists.But of all you have heard about this movie the main them of this movie is not violence but redemption.	5.0	The Tyranny of Evil Men	2005-04-22	6	5	1
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A4MBXZ5KWPS96	Hames Jetfield	This movie could very well be the best movie ever made to date.  This could be a little exaggerated, but I think that it is a distict possibility.  Samuel L. Jackson's character, Jules Winnfield, is probably one of the best character's ever in a movie.  His dialect is incredible, and Ezekiel 25: 17 is a great great quote.  Quentin Tarantino expresses his complete intelligence (and insanity) in this flick.  I would highly recommend purchasing this movie, because you will not regret it...	5.0	incredible movie	2003-06-18	0	0	0

John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames ignite the screen in this action-packed, character-driven, multi-layered story. John Travolta proves he's still got the moves in a dance scene with Uma Thurman.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A37DLVPKJZGSQF	Hannibal	One of the most famous movies of the 1990's, Pulp Fiction is a graphic, crowd-pleasing, shocking and awesome crime drama that boasts more astonishing ideas than any movie I can remember for the 1990-1995 period. This is, quite simply, a masterpiece with poignancy, comedy and sheer brilliance packed into one big, explosive movie that we'll never forget. Not only one of the best films of 1990's, Pulp Fiction also gives us one of the most ensemble casts in a film ever. Picture this: Rosanna Arquette, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames and Eric Stoltz. All of them give great performances and all are amazing actors! What acting heaven! But that's not the best thing about the movie, believe it or not. The script is. Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary breathtaking, descriptive and unexplainably excellent screen-writing skills are ... I just can't explain it. The script is so good it'll knock your socks off. Quentin's direction is also very worthy of praise, he dares to go the next step in filmmaking and wins the audience over. Due to the extreme amount of violence, drugs, language and sexuality, I strongly advise the faint-hearted and children to keep way away from this movie. Otherwise, if you don't mind a bit of naughty fun and a huge, exciting spark in your movie-life, then see this now! Pulp Fiction is definitely an experience you won't forget easily.	5.0	Breathtaking filmmaking! One of the best of the 1990's!	2001-08-27	11	8	3

To say that I'm overwhelmed would be a fitting analysis. I had to go pee after watching the last scene.I do not think any thriller will match it's quotient. Loved the definition of divine intervention and I highly acclaim Tarantino's style of dialogue and conversation flow he adds to films making you forget you are watching a film like nooone else does. At his best, he is better than Speilberg, Martin Scorsese and even my Godfather Sam Mendes.Have you seen 12 Angry Men? If not, I highly recommend it.I do think like me you have seen Pulp fiction in parts but that would be a product of wishful thinking.You might have seen the whole thing.One of the best films I've had a privilege of seeing.It makes Death Proof, Departed, Kill Bill look rather tame.	5.0	Divine	2009-04-17	1	0	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3GLALCBHOR3T	Harry Georgatos	Friends always ask me what's in the briefcase? For me it is Ving Rhames soul. When Travolta opens the case Tarantino cuts to an insert shot of the combination which is 666. 666 is the devils number. Once the case is opened there's a golden glow which is Rhames soul. The kids in the apartment are the devil's handlers. When the gunman comes out of the other room and shoots at Jackson and Travolta and misses them at point-blank-range Travolta and Jackson shoot dead the gunmam. Jackson looks at the bullet holes on the wall and has a religious realization that God came down from Heaven and stopped those bullets. That's what happened, God did come down from Heaven and stopped those bullets. At that point in the movie Travolta and Jackson where doing a beautiful thing in retreiving one's soul (even though Rhames is a gangster!). The first shot in the movie of Rhames is a back shot of his head with a band-aid in his back neck. The devil makes an incision in the back of the neck and strips out the soul which explains the band-aid. The reason why Tarantino has a complex non-linear narrative makes sense with the final scene in the cafe. In the cafe Jackson wants to give up his gangster/hitman life and become like Kane in KUNG-FU and roam the planet. Jackson has had his religious realisation where Travolta refuses to believe God came down from Heaven and stopped those bullet, and to compound Travolta's sin is that he's eating bacon which is a sin in God's eyes. This explains why Travolta was machine-gunned old-testament style by Willis to death for being a non-believer. Jackson by not shooting Tim Roth and the girl in the cafe buys back his soul and becomes a believer. I tell friends of my interpretations and they think I'm a crackpot, but I firmly believe Tarantino has put these subliminal religious messages in his film. This is a cult-classic masterpiece that demands repeated viewings!	5.0	Cult-classic!!	2011-08-30	10	2	8

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3CO750VRCXLIE	Hasnor Lot	"Not many works go further towards closing the putative gap between a film and a movie than Pulp Fiction; here is a film praised to high heaven for its supposedly fresh innovations and ingenious breakthrough in filmmaking, and an entertaining movie enjoyed for its hipness. In short, a piece of cinema appealing to both the megaplex crowd and megalomaniac critics alike.But again not many works come closer towards emphasizing the distinction between a film and a movie than Pulp Fiction; here is not a film if by that denotation we conceive of a cinematic work capable of transporting its viewers to an elevated plane of visceral experience, but (merely) a fun movie worth renting for the weekend.To an audience ignorant of cinema history, any of Tarantino's numerous homages to old masters or attempts at deconstructionist genre subversion or postmodern ironies will pass unnoticed--what remains is essentially a ""cool"" flick. In fact, anyone watching this movie now for the first time will understandably wonder why it was so much hyped back then. What was raved as cool and interesting in 1994--conversation about what the French call a Quarter Pounder for example--would now be received as inane and pointless. (Of course, one reason being so many movies tried to replicate Tarantino's formula that the original actually becomes the derivative in a cosmic irony of the M&ouml;bius kind).In essence, an enjoyment of this movie depends very much on one's frame of mind, and one's expectation of it: if the viewer expects to see innovative filmmaking so beloved by critics back then, he would probably be disappointed. If the viewer deigns to sit back and simply enjoy an entertaining escapist treat for the weekend, he is in for a helluva ride."	4.0	Frame of Mind Very Important	2003-07-08	0	0	0

Jackson's multidimensional talents, is a cinema-graphic triumph of a very high order.Tarrintino has done it again: pulled off the impossible and the surreal and made it seem so imminently possible and real: This movie, more than any other, is truly a new metaphor of our hectic times. As is true with all of his work, the technical aspects of Tarrintino's work are so carefully worked out and put in place - the utter cleverness and darkness of the subtext, the casting, the scenery, the character development, the script, the writing, the directing, the brutal artistic honesty -- that the critic has no place to turn to ""nitpick.""His art, as is the case with any truly good art, is ""above critique:""It just ""IS."" Period.It's multi-sided vignettes are angular pegs that do not fit in any square holes, yet taken together, they add up to a whole much larger than the sum of their parts. Altogether the movie (or the book) shouldn't work, but the script and the writing are handled with such exquisite aesthetic balance and sensitivity that not only do they work, but in doing so, the movie sets a new standard of cinema-graphic possibilities: It is an aesthetic feast well ahead of its times; one that makes the mind itch in places that can't even be accessed, let alone be scratched.This is the only movie I have watched twenty times and still see new things in it that speak to our hectic times. It does not come as a surprise, nor does it bother me that its primary appeal is worldwide, rather than domestic. It was especially an unexpected hit in Japan and Europe. Every actor in it should have won an academy award, especially Jackson, Travolta, Thurman and Willis. It is like a basketball team that wins the NCAA championship: It could not have been pulled off without all of the characters playing their respective parts and doing so at the highest level of their art.

Add Chistopher Walken and HARVEY KEITAL--Geez, it doesn't get any better. I must, also, mention Uma Thurmon. Maybe, her best performance ever. Plus Bruce Willis (very good), Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer and more. WHAT A GREAT CAST!!Hats off to Quentin Tarentino, who both wrote (not everyone will appreciate the subject matter) and directed this film. He also appears in this too. The time lines and structure of this movie are genius, but this style is truly the mark of Tarentino's work.What's it about? Mostly it's just a day in the life. Of who? A couple hit men, a boxer, a gangster, some wanna' be's, a drug dealer, low rent robbers, perverts and whoever crosses the path of the afore mentioned. It's grisly and there's humor.

I guess you could also say it's the All About Eve of our time because it's so well written.Pulp Fiction is fresh and original, and the dialogue is delicious. Purely sensational! When we hear something like ""I want a pot belly""...""If I had one I'd wear a t-shirt two size too small...""- that MEANS something! That's ABOUT something! Appeal to the touch can be shockingly different to appeal to the eyes and Quentin Tarantino showed that to the world in merely a series of well-written lines.Aside from Pulp Fiction's dialogue, the story is moved along by its actors.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1Y2UGUCT44QH2	Ian Hutchins	Alright, so up to last night I was probably the only person on gods green earth who hadn't seen this movie.Needless to say, i'm glad I did; It was pretty freaking awesome.In this installment to his array of unique cinematic masterpieces, Quentin Tarantino delivers a stylized non-linear storyabout, well, seven other intertwining stories.It's well written, the cinematography is great, the soundtrack is perfectly fitted to the movieand to top it off, the whole fiasco is 100% original; I kid you not, there is no movie that youcan compare to this one.Now of course after a cinematic triumph like this, theres gonna be a lot of wanna-be's, you knowthe films that try to have the dialogue carry the whole thing but it just doesn't have the same affect.This movie made it clear why Tarantino has his own genre, and in all honesty, this is one of the greatest movies i've ever seen.The bottom line this time around is a 95%- A sheer definition of good filmmaking, Pulp Fiction redefined boththe noir genre and the movie genre as a whole, and in turn is a heavily inspirational fiasco that triumphs on all levels.UPDATE TIME!So, what happens when a completely overrated movie gets praise as one of the greatest movies of all time? People like me take notice and want to share their opinion,besides, it's what all the cool kids are doing.Pulp Fiction is really not as good as everyone behaves it is, it's just not. I mean granted, a lump sum of the Tarantino universe is prominent in this film, and if you'reeither a Tarantino fan, or just someone who likes good writing, you'll probably enjoy this movie.KEEP IN MIND, I'm not saying it's a bad movie, i'm just conveying that it's not the act of god everyone says it is.To be fair, Tarantino is not a bad Director, he's just not an amazing one either, and it actually baffles me that there are better Writers/Directors that no one has ever heard of.So, does that mean that the rating for this movie dropped? Oh you bet! But not by as much as it should have, i will say it's a70%- Although Interesting and Unique, Pulp Fiction is an absurdly overrated fiasco that is not deserving of it's credentials as one for the greatest movies of all time.	4.0	Good, but Drastically Overrated	2014-03-08	0	0	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A35XFZN4MWNKK4	ianphillips@uk.dreamcast.com	Whilst not being quite as compelling or abrasive as Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino's follow-up doesn't disappoint and merley confirmed his genius for writing hard-bolied, attitude-laced comic dialogue. The scripts ride along like a rollercoaster and are complimented by the rich and compelling performances from an excellent cast which stars John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson, Bruce Willis, Harvey Kietel and Uma Thurman amongst many others. Again like Reservoir Dogs, the film switches backwards and fowards to depict an astonishing run of crossplots and a wealth of characters. This was something remarkable considering Tarantino was still vastly learning his trade. His deep, genius talents come into full force in this astonishing, diverse, imaginitive movie that boasts an equally sizzling soundtrack. The high calibre writing is astounding as are particularly the revitalised John Travolta and the then largely unknown Samuel L. Jackson. The film went onto win oscars for Tarantino and his co-writer Roger Avary. Exhilirating stuff and one of the best and important films made in the 1990's.

Jackson  and John Travolta.Stellar performances.Samuel was  hysterical.*Excellent(though a little confusing)direction.*The movie  is virtually star-studded.*Surprisingly,Bruce Willis acted  brilliantly.*Harvey Keitel's scenes were some of the best parts in the  film.Is this guy a great actor or what?*A John Travolta dancing  scene.Cons:*The movie's a little confusing.I've seen it about six  times,and still haven't gathered the plot in one specific order.*Does  anyone know what was in the briefcase?I still don't know.The  bottomline:buy it immediately.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A35FIQ83PE0E07	Irikefe Okonedo	I do not deny that this much lauded Quentin Tarantino film set in a violent underworld is enjoyable. There is snappy dialogue, interesting characters - such as Samuel L. Jackson's Bible-quoting hit man, Harvey Keitel's problem solving `Wolf' and Bruce Willis's boxer on the run - intelligent banter between the film's various characters - such as between Samuel L. Jackson and his hit man partner John Travolta and between John Travolta and his gangster boss's wife Uma Thurman when the two of them go out on a `date' - a number of conflicts involving guns that highlight the violent underworld which the film's characters inhabit, a particularly horrifying scene that takes place in the basement of a  second-hand store and even an excellent cameo from Tarantino himself as Samuel L. Jackson's testy friend who doesn't want his wife to find out about his underworld connections. But these elements unfortunately do not add up to a whole because this film is lacking the most basic ingredient that any film must possess: a plot. There just isn't one. Lots of `stuff' happens in this film but there is no story to follow, no tale being told, just the activities of a group of disparate characters who do this and that and then the film is over. It may seem strange that I am giving this film 4 stars after such criticism but that is because what there is to watch is enjoyable as I have already said, despite the film's severe shortcomings. This is a testament to Tarantino's ability to create an enjoyable film experience for the viewer. But just as candy floss is only meant to please the taste buds and not fill the stomach likewise this film cannot be considered a meal, because of what it lacks. Yes, it is enjoyable. But it is no classic.	4.0	No classic	2008-07-20	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2H1WNB30JNAWU	Jack D. Lowry	"Pulp Fiction is by far one of the single best movies I have ever seen in movie history.  I say that because of the amount of great actors in it and supporting actors  for the storylines.  The scrpit is also very good and important to the movie.  Their are mutiple lines in the movie that I personally enjoy, ""Personality goes a long way"" the religious passage Jackson keeps repeating threwout the movie.  We all have our favorite moments during the movie, but some of us don't know or realize that the movie itself is actually filmed from the end back to the begginning of the movie at the coffee shop where it starts which is actually the end.  But just watch the movie and see for yourself how much you enjoy the movie QT wrote and directed.  I only took one star off because of the amount of bad language relating to religious words, me being Catholic just took offense to it.  But rest of the movie I enjoy time and time again and never get tired of watching it."	4.0	One of the single best movies ever I have seen movies wise	2012-12-11	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A26F65TDP7H3TO	Jackson.baker	Two couples having breakfast at a diner and decided to rob the place.  Two hit men have a simple job.  A mobsters wife has to be watched.  A mix up with a boxer.  All become combined together to give you a different view on the mob.  Written and directed in 1994 by the peculiar genius Quentin Tarantino,  evolved the best screenplay Pulp Fiction.This movie stars actors such as Samuel L. Jackson who play Jules Winnfield, a strong religious hit-man who does what needs to be done and no excuses.  John Travolta plays Vince Vega, a witty man who does things the way he wants things to be done and will question authority who tends to make the wrong choices.  Vince is also a hit-man who works with Jules.The other side of that story is the mob leader Marcellus Wallace, played by Ving Rhames. A tough man who will punish anyone who messes around with him or his mob.  Wallace ends up hearing that his wife Mia Wallace played by Uma Thurman got a foot massage by someone, but Wallace thinks is was more so he orders Vince to stay and watch her when everything goes downhill.The second side to the story is the boxer Butch played by Bruce Willis.  A strong man with much anger built up inside.  He ends up beating someone to death at a boxing match when not ordered to win by Marcellus Wallace.  Wallace sends his hit man Vince to take care of that when we find that things don&#8217;t go as planned.Finally, the story of the happy couple of bandits, Ringo/Pumpkin played by Tim Roth and Yolanda/Hunny Bunny played by Amanda Plummer.  They just are having breakfast at an ordinary diner and decide to rob the place when something unexpected occurs.Some fun facts nn the movie: the part when Jules recites Ezekiel 25:17, the part about the righteous man and the shepherd were actually not in the bible; Tarantino and Jackson added that in.  Also the car that was used as Vince&#8217;s car was actually stolen and used for the movie; Tarantino stole the car.Tarantino was inspired to write this movie because he thought it would be cool to make a movie with multiple stories and combining them together.  Tarantino got these ideas from magazines such as &#8220;Black Mask&#8221;.  It was made to be a movie of the pulp genre which is a sub-genre that has luric subjects and is usually on a magazine of some sort.Pulp Fiction is a different and a fun movie to watch.  It does get confusing at times as in when a certain event is happening.  With Pulp Fiction&#8217;s fun subtleties this does truly make an amazing movie with different views from people about the movie.  At the end it all comes together to make a spectacular movie.	5.0	Pulp Fiction Review	2014-05-27	0	0	0

But what I have noticed is that no matter how many times I watch it, I can't get over how good the dialog is in every scene and how we accually want to know more about ever character in the movie. Tarantino made in my opinion a movie equal in stature to Citizen Kane and The Godfather. But like what Kane and The Godfather both did to Wells and Coppala, Pulp Fiction will over shadow every other movie Tarantino makes. He will never top it. Because it is both a great movie and a cult hit. It is a must see for and film buff.	5.0	Citizen Kane for Tarantino...	2002-08-28	0	0	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3JB5DUGY2GB8C	Jacob Hughes	Wow, Pulp Fiction.  Probably one of my personal favorite films, Pulp Fiction is a film that feels very trashy.  Tarantino shows a love for the atmosphere of the junky, cheap, bizarre pulp novels.  The structure of the film is unlike anything else, told in little interweaving story arcs that all tie together into a larger story, one that is pieced together as the film goes on.  It is a film with no actual heroes, besides Bruce Willis' character of Butch.  Butch is even no saint, having a wild temper and really only looking out for himself.  All the characters have an other worldly feel to them, like we are getting a glimpse into the alternate universe Earth that exists only in pulp novels.  There is a common misconception that Tarantino is a action film director, and this couldn't be farther from the truth.  Tarantino's films are driven by dialog, and his flair as a writer is demonstrated in Pulp Fiction.  The characters interact realistically, and as always his dialog is spot on for its setting.  Tarantino is a master of his craft and is really spot on in his film making.  Pulp Fiction is hands down his masterpiece, and deserves its place in history for its unique style, pulpy setting, and amazing dialog.	5.0	Tarantino's Masterpiece	2011-11-27	1	0	1
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1TUP0W3IO6IGZ	Jai	This is, put simply, one of the most entertaining films of the last decade or so...except of course for viewers who can't abide too much profanity or violence. With an absolutely brilliant script (Tarantino's wordplay skills  are every bit as strong as his storytelling is irreverent and  unconventional) and performances that do it more than justice, backed by a  rollicking, hand-picked soundtrack, PF succeeds in captivating one for the  better part of two and a half hours. With little regard for chronology, the  film jumps back and forth in time, eventually ending up at more or less the  same point where it began - but if you think there's no method in this  apparent madness, try out a simple experiment...piece the events of the film  together in their right order and then imagine how it would appear onscreen  in that, `logical' form...you'll probably be surprised at how hollow and  ineffective the end product would be!  At any rate, what impresses me  most about this film is, as mentioned earlier, it's entertainment quotient.  It's all very well for analytical-minded viewers to endlessly discuss what  the briefcase contains, the Biblical parallels of the  Travolta/Jackson/Willis/Rhames characters, and various other themes - but  the upshot is that this is, in its own right, an immensely watchable film  that played an important role in rejuvenating the medium in the mid-90s.	5.0	Well worth multiple viewings!	2000-07-02	2	1	1

I mean, what could be more fascinating from a cultural studies point of view?  Watching Pulp Fiction, one gets the impression that Tarantino does not have an original thought in his head, that his brain is literally overflowing with all of the ... American films he has consumed.  Alas, I appear to be the only dissenting voice here and my vote will do little to detract from the 5-star overall rating.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1A535W556ROBQ	James Ferguson	Pulp Fiction is now a classic.  It is the most satisfying of Tarrantino's movies as he artfully weaves together a compelling set of stories into a riveting film.  This film also saw the welcome return of John Travolta as a very hip hitman.  But, what distanced this movie from other &quot;art house&quot; action movies was Tarrantino's consumate skills as a storyteller.  &quot;The Watch&quot; was a wonderful piece, woven seamlessly into Bruce Willis' memorable role as the boxer.Unfortunately, Tarrantino has not been able to match this effort in subsequent movies.  Pulp Fiction may go down as the Citizen Kane of the &quot;thrill kill&quot; generation. It brings together a great ensemble of actors playing their roles to the hilt.  Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as the Ecclesiastics-driven killer.  Tarrantino may have made this look like an off-hand effort but there are few throw-away lines in this movie.  He ties all his stories together with a keen eye for social commentary. He has given a strange and even beautiful meaning to the chaotic world of violence we now find ourselves associated with, a definite notch about the Peckinpah-inspired violence of Reservoir Dogs.	5.0	A consumate storyteller	2003-12-02	4	1	3
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AL5OEDM8TPTKV	James Hiller	It's been about 10 years since I sat myself down and had the Pulp Fiction experience. I took another look at this film after watching Tarantino's recent tour de force &quot;Kill Bill&quot;. Must has been said about Pulp Fiction, from being a violent bloodfest to a spiritual journey; but one thing is certainly true: Pulp Fiction is a cinematic classic.Pulp Fiction is really three films wrapped in one: the story of two hitmen sent out on a job to retrieve a briefcase, a boxer asked to throw a fight, and an actress with a habit that nearly kills her. These stories are intertwined effectively and effortlessly, the seems between them are negligible, so when one character from another story suddenly pops up in another one, its understandable.It took Tarantino's vision to pull this off. Clearly, he's at the forefront of this movie, from its look and style. First, the sharp script, dialogue heavy, is extremely well written. When the Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield dish about Amsterdam McDonald's burgers, you realize you are listening to golden words. This isn't your average violent flick.What also sets Pulp Fiction apart from your average violent flick is that much of the direct violence is never seen, or handled offscreen. Give Tarantino credit for making us think it's a bloodfest, but in reality, other films that have violent scenes that run for ten minutes, compared to Fictions quick scenes, you see the difference. Tarantino manages to build suspense and tension, in order for us to think it's more violent than it is.In addition to that scene, the other classic scene occurs between Vincent Vega and Uma's slinky Mia Wallace at Jack Rabbit Slim's. I was totally entranced by the absolute perfection that scene has. From the stylistic 50's diner atmosphere, to the oddly weird and normal twist contest Mia and Vincent enter, it's brilliant from start to finish.Pulp Fiction is a cinematic feast from beginning to end. Thanks to Quention for preparing it for us, and may we gorge for many years to come.	5.0	Gotta Get To Jack Rabbit Slim's	2004-05-02	5	2	3

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3CSBYFVY4PHZD	Jason	"The 1990's was a huge year for Writer, Director, Producer and Actor Quentin Tarintino. In 1992 he released his first major hit ""Reservoir Dogs"", in 1994 he released his Oscar winning ""Pulp Fiction"" and in 1997 he released the hit ""Jackie Brown"". (Not to mention his involvement in such films as ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", ""Four Rooms"", ""Killing Zoe"" and ""Desperado""). But his greatest accomplishment had to be ""Pulp Fiction"". With jaw chewing dialouge, a dynamic cast and great directing, Pulp Fiction has deserved its ""just rewards"". The story actually tells three stories woven into one, including two ""low rent"" hit-men (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), a last chance prize fighter (Bruce Willis) and a loving couple of robbers (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer). But that is'nt even the tip of the iceberg when it comes to who else is added into the mix. With other stars such as Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Uma Thurman, Patricia Arquette, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitel and of course Quentin Tarintino. This film has such notable sayings as ..., ""Royale Wit Cheese"", ""Thats thirty-minutes away, I'll be there in ten"", ""I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage counselling, no trial separation, divorced"",""Correctamundo!"", ""Oh I'm Sorry, Did I Break Your Concentration?"" and ""Ezekiel 25:17: The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.

And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.""

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A8KDNHIYJ9339	Jason	The first time I saw this film I was wondering how in the world could this be nominated for any Academy Award, but the film grows on you, and you really realize that this film is extremely humorous.The action is superb, and the performance of Samuel L. Jackson is absolutely the best of his career. This DVD dont have ANY special features, but its still one of the greatest DVD's you could add to your DVD Collection, (with exception of THE GODFATHER COLLECTION and GLADIATOR [2000], which have superb special features, and are GREAT movies as well).A film lead with a brilliant writer/director (Quentin Tarintino) and an ALLSTAR cast, with such names as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Amanda Plummer, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Kathy Griffin, and Phil Lamar!You really cant afford to miss this cinematic masterpiece!

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3JXVV1QJ68PAX	Jason Wilkerson	...comes one of the greatest movies of are time. Part of a three part series from Quentin Tarantino (also featuring Reservoir Dogs, and the unmade Vega Brothers which would feature Vincent Vega played by John Travolta and Vic Vega played by Michael Madsen) this is my second favorite movie of all time. Many of you have read the review of this tangled movie, now I will untangle this movie for you.In chronoligical order this movie actually starts with Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) running an errand for Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) picking up a suitcase of who-knows-what from a few punks who were &quot;associates&quot; with Mr. Wallace. On the way up Jules and Vince discuss Wallace's wife as Vince was asked to take care of her while Wallace is out of town on business. After a few minutes of excellent dialogue they finally enter the apartment of the punks. They shoot two of them and narrowly avoid being shot in what Jules calls a miracle that causes him to decide to get out of his current profession. Instead of killing the third punk they decide to bring him before Wallace.Unfortunately on there way to meet Wallace Vince accidently shoots him in the face and their plan has to change as the car is now covered in blood and brains. So they swing by a friend's house (Quentin Tarantino) where they call Wallace to get some help so they can dispose of the body and clean out the car. In comes Winston Wolf (Harvey Keitel) who gets everything fixed before their buddy's wife gets home and divorces him.From here they go to get some breakfast where they run into a couple (Tim Roth &amp; Amanda Plummer) who are attempting to rob the bank. This is one of those few parts that I can't give away what happens as this scene opens and ends the film. From here Jules and Vince go to a bar to meet up with Wallace who is having a conference with a prize boxer named Butch (Bruce Willis) in an effort to pay him to throw a fight.That night Vince has his &quot;date&quot; with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) Marcellus's wife but before he goes he scores some coke from a friend of his named Lance (Eric Stoltz). The date is one of the big scenes of the movie it's here we get to see John Travolta's dance steps and Uma Thurman OD on coke, as well as appearances by Buddy Holly, Ed Sullivan, and Marilyn Monroe.The final scene chronologically deals with Butch's choice to not throw the fight, and the consequences of that choice. This is a very spectacular movie that I think everyone should watch at least once.	5.0	From the greatest film maker of our day...	2004-05-20	3	0	3

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A8HSKERHIDCVH	"J. C. Woods ""silvannus"""	Normally I would hate this kind of manipulative movie. But it only goes to show: people only hate being manipulated when it is done badly, when they can see what's coming. In this movie, you can't. Part of that is  manipulation. The story is not told in order, but broken into pieces. Then  the pieces are shuffled. Nothing occurs in chronological order. The Hero  actually rides off into the sunset with his girl in the middle of the movie  (though in the temporal sequence that's the last thing to happen). It's a  gangster movie with a sub-text. Anybody who has seen Quentin Tarantino in  &quot;Sleep with Me&quot; knows what I am talking about. Tarrantino's  character, in that movie, insists the movie &quot;Top Gun&quot; is not  about jet pilots. It's about Tom Cruise's struggle with homosexuality.  &quot;Top Gun&quot; is never the same movie after that. I suspect, in the  same way, that Pulp Fiction is not a movie about gangsters, but about  miracles, redemption and newness of life. Samuel L. Jackson and John  Travolta are the central characters, a couple of hit men who make their  murderous way through life until something amazing happens that separates  them. They disagree as to the event's nature, one taking it as a miracle,  the other as an accident. They go their separate ways (they must, a hit man  who believe he has seen a miracle can't be a hit man anymore). This leaves  in it's wake several small acts of redemption and reconciliation. All of it  is prefigured in the first story by the raising of the dead.This movie has  a sub-text.	5.0	A course in miracles?	2000-06-29	4	1	3

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"This is truly a movie I should not like. It's profane, gory and violent. So why do I watch it again and again?Quentin Tarentino has assembled the coolest cast (Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel Jackson and more) in the weirdest and least likely comic vehicle ever produced. The film follows a cast of hoodlums, hit men and drug queens as they interact in the mean streets of Los Angeles. The film plays with time, jumbling time sequences so that ""dead"" characters come back to life. Hilarity ensues from the bumbling actions of Scripture-spouting hit men, heroin-addled heroines and various pimped-up freaks and tough guys. There is genuine camaraderie, honor and restraint between the most death-dealing of characters, which makes them sympathetic and gives the film its bizarre charm.Comedy aside, this movie is not for the faint of heart. There's plenty of gore, lots of gunplay, profanity by the bucketful and heart-stopping drug scenes."	5.0	A Comedy of Err-ers	2004-11-19	4	3	1

I love all of the actors, Bruce Willis as a boxer running from a man he was paid to throw a fright, John Travolta, and Samuel Jackson with his overacting both are hit men, sent to kill Willis. This movie is so realistic that rather than watch it, a person could live it, having a normal conversation or dancing with someone's girlfriend like Travolta and Uma. It does have its funny moments with in your face humor, but otherwise there are four parts of a legitimate movie rather than you talking with your friends. There are also a few cameos, one of which is Christopher Walken who has a comical 5 minutes telling an 8 year old boy how a watch was smuggled safely so Walken could give it to the boy.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3PE884TA8529G	J. E. Nelson	"This is one of those movies people seem to love or hate.  I must admit, the first time I saw the movie, I did not care for it.  When I watched it a second time, a lot of things fell into place and I really thought it was a brilliant movie.I do not want to give out too many details in the rare event someone is unfamiliar with this movie.  Pulp Fiction is essentially a modern day violet, shoot'em up gangster movie.  What makes this movie unique is the sequence the story is presented.  It is the sequencing of the story that I initially found annoying and made the movie a little hard for me to follow the first time I saw it.  The movie revolves around two ""enforcers"", Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson).  While the story line is simply, it is built up very well by the various encounters the two have, from acquiring a briefcase for their boss to one almost killing the boss' wife.  The plot all comes together to tell a great story of violence, deception, victimization, and redemption.For what I would call a low budget flick, the acting in the movie is phenomenal by most of the actors.  Travolta and Jackson give an exceptional performance playing the two gangland enforcers.  Ving Rhames does a great job in his short role as the hard-nosed gang boss.  Quentin Tarantino also gives a stellar performance as the high-strung former associate of Jules.  However, I though Harvey Keitel stole the show with his performance as Winston Wolfe, a freelance gangster that ""solves problems"".  Personally, I thought Bruce Willis gave a lack-luster presentation as Butch Coolidge, an aging boxer with mob ties.All in all, I found the movie to be quite genius with a touch of insanity, a mix that Quentin Tarantino seems to have perfected.  This was a rare movie that seems to be better the second time it is watched.  If you are into violent movies with plots such as Goodfellas, The Last Boyscout, or Face Off, this is probably a movie that you would enjoy.  If you don't care for movies with random ""twists and turns"", this is one to skip."	5.0	A Little Bit of Genius, A Little Bit Of Insanity	2005-12-04	6	3	3
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3B27A89XX8C8V	Jennafer Wells	Quentin Tarantino really did an excellent job with this film.  The way that the plotline unfolds really makes the movie, it was done in such a creative way.  How the characters are introduced gives the illusion that you are just reading a book with everything being played out for you which leaves room for some interpretation.  Their little conversations and happenings help you to better understand the characters and these small conversations and happenings lead to the bigger picture.  If you like a movie that makes you question things and think about life in a different way this movie is a winner.  It was really enjoyable for me.	5.0	Fantastic	2003-07-08	4	2	2
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	"With its stylish attitude, Pulp Fiction was the movie of the nineties. It uses the characters in such ways to intrigue the viewer into watching it. A brilliant, captivating film from start to finish. Samuel L. Jackson is simply brilliant in his part, as is John Travolta and Ving Rhames. By now, the entire world has seen Pulp Fiction. Tarantino dialogue was flying about everywhere back then. All I can say is what an amazingly brilliant film!Tarantino is great in cinematography or no matter what he does. To me he doesn't do enough as far as I am concerned. Yes, this film is unbelievably violent...but creatively violent. In a lesser director's hands, it would have been a disaster. The sheer artfulness of the film offsets its violent nature. A fantastic story which is very uniquely set out. If you haven't seen this film yet, you would be well advised to. But be warned. In my experience there are two kinds of people, those who love Pulp Fiction and those who hate Pulp Fiction. For some reason nobody claims this to be ""sort of alright"" it's either ""greatest movie ever"" or the complete opposite. Quentin Tarantino has an eye for every little detail...camera angles...dialogue...background music...you name it. He has a style all to his own.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1ARZLZRS4JZX7	Jerry Call	"I got a kick out of ""Pulp Fiction"" the first time I saw it. I didn't think it was a great movie, by any stretch, but it was pretty entertaining. Like most people who aren't hip to the underworld of big American cities like Los Angeles, I felt like the movie gave me sort of a guided tour of the I'll-be-damned-if-they-ain't-cool-sometimes activities of heroin use and murder for hire. There are a lot of big-name actors in ""Pulp Fiction,"" and it kind of serves the same purpose for them; you can tell they are reveling in the opportunity to jazz their careers up by playing criminals and violent misfits.After the shrill overexposure this film received when its shot at the Oscars came up, I figured I'd see it a couple more times, to determine if it was really the artistic milestone it was being hyped as. It wasn't. In fact, I found it much less entertaining each time I saw it. I knew exactly what was going to happen, and the plot, even with its film-school-cliche-trying-to-pass-as-innovation choppiness, is about all ""Pulp Fiction"" has going for it. The acting (except for Samuel L. Jackson's) is paper thin and shallow, and its nastiness, which was almost damn awesomely radical the first time, gets boring, which is the worst thing a movie can be when it's trying to be cool."	3.0	Don't See It More Than Once, or It Will Start to Suck	2005-01-13	13	4	9

I especially enjoyed Bruce Willis because he gave an exceptional  performance that was both unique and meaningful. John Travolta was also a lot of fun to watch. The man is a true professional and always gives a wonderful performance in movies, but in ""Pulp Fiction"" he is even more fun to watch because he put so much life and energy into the role that he plays. If you try to follow the story you'll probably get lost, so don't.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2NJU6KZVSWU1X	Jimmy Juice	It is a good film, but one major flaw. For example: in one of the film's most violent scenes, John Travolta turns around to ask the black guy about the &quot;angel&quot; who saved him and Jackson. His gun accidentally goes  off, the windshield gets covered in blood, and, well, though you'd be  afraid to admit it, it's funny. But, to the flaw, Travolta seems to lose  his evilness for that second, seems to get over exited, and acts more like  a little kid then someone who just committed MURDER. I doubt that Tarantino  wanted him to act that exited before the big splatter, and his presense  practically ruins the whole scene, which could be the best of the movie. I  give it four out of five anyway.	4.0	big flaw	1999-12-04	14	1	13

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1SBYF53BW5YC1	J. Kondakji	I am not going to explain the plot or give any viewpoints of this movie.  Other reviewers may be as useful as a brain dead vegetable and assume people just go online browsing for movies to buy that they've never heard of before, but I give a little more credit than that.  This is a review of the actual product.  DO NOT get this version of Pulp Fiction if you are looking to buy a nice collector's edition.  It does come with the extra disc; however the packaging is nothing like in the picture.  It's in a normal DVD case with one of those duel disc flaps.  So the discs aren't touching one another, but there is no nice casing or extra pictures or anything that the advertisement for this product would lead you to believe.  I suggest you just save your money and get the normal version (it's only about a $5 difference so if that doesn't matter to you then go for it).	1.0	This is a review of the actual, physical product	2011-07-29	43	12	31
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A8F2AZWB20X1H	JLind555	&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is like a novel with five chapters that was ripped apart and put back together with the chapters all mixed up in random order -- where does it start and where does it end?  That said, it's a  hilarious crazy-quilt of a movie, superbly directed by Quentin Tarantino.  And yes, there is a straight story line throughout... chronologically, the  actual story begins with Samuel Jackson and John Travolta on their way to a  hit ordered by their boss Ving Rhames, and ends with Bruce Willis and his  pregnant girlfriend zooming out of town on a homicidal maniac's stolen  motorcycle.  Each short story in the movie is complete in itself, and yet  each makes up part of the whole.  The actors are terrific.  Jackson and  Travolta are great as the two hitmen Jules and Vince; Uma Thurman is just  right as the boss's wife; Bruce Willis is funny and yet moving as the boxer  who saves the boss's life after the boss ordered a hit on him, and Harvey  Keitel steals the whole movie with his performance as the almost inhumanly  efficient Wolf.  Even Tarantino himself can't resist joining the fun and  plays the role of Jules's sometime partner Jimmie, very annoyed at being  roused out of bed at the crack of dawn to help dispose of a semi-headless  corpse.  There are so many priceless scenes in this film that it's hard to  pick a favorite.  It's a wild, crazy, mind-boggling movie that gets better  and better each time you watch it.	5.0	Pure Golden Pulp	2000-02-18	112	89	23

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AD9GDCEVZTJCT	J.Lucas	'Pulp Fiction', by the great Quentin Tarantino, is probably my favorite movie. The acting, characters, and overall story are simply brilliant. When you see the movie for the first time you might get a little confused(i was), because it is actually three stories in one that all interwine somehow.The start of story is about two hitmen taking care of a little business. Later in that story one of those hitmen has to take out his bosses wife and show her a good time while he is away.After this the movie changes a little and now it seems to be a story about a boxer who has to flee the country trying to get away from his boss who he has just betrayed.After all this it goes back to the part with the two hitmen who have to call this specailist to help them get out of some trouble they had just gotten into. In the end the movie somehow all makes sense. You should definetly see it more than once to get a full understanding of it. Quentin Tarantino hits another homerun in this instant classic.	5.0	"Pulp Fiction (1994)~~~""Does he look like a bi***?"""	2005-02-13	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A175GIISFGGO31	Joe Clay	Pulp Fiction,  directed by Quentin Tarantino is a cinematic masterpiece,  pure and simple.  This incredible film that depicts gangsters and thier lives in California is startling,  realistic,  brutal,  engrossing,  electrifying,  I could go on and on with adjectives.  Tarantino assembled a top notch cast of actors including Samuel Jackson, Uma Thurman,  Ving Rhames, John Travolta,  and Bruce Willis.  The actors do terrific characters....Travolta was so good he was nominated for an Oscar.But the real standout is the director Tarantino.  He makes a series of advance and backward scenes that is spellbinding.  There is loads of the 'n' word but frankly speaking....this is how people talk!!!  Tarantino always captures realistic human interaction and its extremely gripping.In closing,  there are very few movies where at the end your jaw is literally on the floor,  but thats what happened after I watched this movie.  Go get it now and prepare for an unforgettable cinematic masterpiece.	5.0	Amazing	2004-08-29	8	5	3

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3VV4GUGLUVUP1	Joel R. Bryan	"Quentin Tarantino cops a little from about a million different sources, mixes in some clever (and occasionally overwritten) dialogue, about a billion ..., some standout performances from John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson (one super-bad cat!), Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis, and comes up with one of the freshest, most influential films in recent years.Travolta and Jackson play two dangerous men in black, paid killers for local kingpin Marcellus Wallace (a glowering, muttering-in-basso Ving Rhames) and they provide the film's central narrative thread.  This bantering pair weaves its way from an early morning hit that ends with a very freakish occurence to a grisly accident to a date with Wallace's lovely wife Mia (Thurman).  Told in a non-linear fashion, the story also manages to incorporate Willis as a pug fighter Wallace has ordered to take a dive (and who has other plans), a death-obsessed cabbie, a pie-loving potbelly-desiring cutie, sexual deviants, and a dance contest at a kitschy 50's-style restaurant.  And then there's the briefcase...Weirdly enough, the film amounts to a kind of hipster/mob sitcom.  Characters get themselves into outlandish situations, and a lot of the film's humor derives from their frantic dialogue as they attempt to extricate themselves.  It's full of quotable quotes, most of which I can't list here, and memorable bits by Christopher Walken, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette and Harvey Keitel as Mr. Wolf, a guy who fixes problems.What's in the case?  It doesn't matter.  What matters is, like that fabled macguffin's mysterious contents, this film dazzles.  It even created a genre, and helped spawn an indie film renaissance of sorts.  Of course, we're probably all a bit weary of smart-alecs with guns popping off rounds and dialogue referencing 70s tv.  And don't worry:  ""Pulp Fiction"" is not nearly as violent as its reputation; for the most part, Tarantino actually cuts away from the gore and leaves a lot to the viewer's imaginations.  That in itself can be a bit off-putting for some.  For others, bite into this slab of cinema that's as meaty and tasty as a Big Kahuna burger."	5.0	"If Elmore Leonard wrote ""Three's Company..."""	2002-03-05	3	2	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A210WDPK4PNA1B	John C	I had known and read about this one for years, but I had never taken time to see it.  It runs a bit over 2.5 hours, so I waited until I had some spare time; nothing detracts from a film so much as seeing it in segments, I think.I half expected the plot to include tabloids and tabloid reporters.  It does not, of course.  I see the point in the film's name.  Those who do not remember the old pulp magazines may wonder about the title.Other reviewers have stated it far better than I can.  My view is that this is an excellent example of a film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, who also plays a small part in it.  Sometimes it requires some thinking to follow the various chronological shifts of the story, but that makes it more interesting.One emerges with a great deal of respect for Tarantino.The acting is great, smoothly done by consummate professionals including John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman, and more.It manages not to take itself totally seriously.  Probably everyone involved in the making of it enjoyed the work, one thinks, but neither is it a light film.If you have not yet seen it, you should.  Unless, of course, you are a prude who is offended by &#34;expletives&#34; not deleted, some violent scenes, and a little sex here and there.	5.0	Great film	2013-09-19	0	0	0

Quentin Tarantino fresh off from directing ""Reservoir Dogs"" which shocked and suprised audiences and critics alke too has created another classic of his but as an anthology. The soundtrack is just outstanding including the amazing performances by the cast which also includes Christopher Walken, Rosanna Aequette, Dwayne Whitaker, Phil Lamarr, Harvey Keital, Quentin Tarantino and Eric Stoltz. The dialog is sharp and so is the original screenplay and the characterizations are well done. This is a knock-your-socks off experience that has became one of the true classics of recent memory that is violent, unique, complex and smart as well with so much memorable quotes you don't know where to start and it's a must see.This 2-Disc DVD set is awesome with it's brilliant transfer and sound quality with some great extras like ""Pulp Fiction: The Facts"" Documentary, deleted scenes, production design featurette, INterview with Tarantino on ""The Charlie Rose Show"", Behind The Scenes Montages, Interviews from the Independent Spirit Awards, Palma D'or Acceptance speech, Reviews and articles on the film, Trailers even international ones, TV Spots, 8 different still galleries, soundtrack chapter stops, and cool DVD-Rom features."	5.0	A modern classic!	2008-09-05	4	3	1

I have researched this and it appears to be an issue with carriers in between my home and Amazon, but it is frustrating to have to pause during movies for this reason.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2GBSL4DSJ7KCY	"""johnny_5"""	"Pulp Fiction is three compelling different stories which all slot into together to form one big one.One story revolves around Vincent (John Travolta) & Jules (Samuel L.Jackson) who are two deadly hit-men on a mission to retrieve a rather mysterious case.The second story on a boxer named Butch (Bruce Willis).And finally Pumpkin (Tim Roth) & Honey Bunny who rob licker stores and restaurants, these two are Bonnie + Clyde type characters.These three stories unbelievably fit perfectly with each other.Wriiten & directed by the king of cool Quentin Tarantino, who needs no introduction.But I'll give you one anyway.In 1992 ""Reservoir Dogs"" burst upon cinema screens across the world; two years later his next film ""Pulp Fiction"" arrived, it won an award at the Cannes Film Festival; a new film-maker had well and truely been born.This film is truely magnificient.It's so original, has a great soundtrack including ""Son Of A Preacher Man"", Dusty Springfield, Urge Overkill, The Revels and the list goes on.The dialogue is so cool and intriuging and they talk about absolutely...nothing.The characters talk about whatevers on their mind.The hit-men have an interesting conversation about hash bars, burgers (""You know what they call a Quarter-Pounder with cheese in Paris?"") and foot massages!It's bizarre, but so unique dialogue.The characters are so suprisingly real and Jackson, Travolta and Willis give out their best performances in ages.Sam Jackson steals every scene with his super cool and smart-(...) dialogue, who is a religious hit-man.One scene to watch out for is when Travolta & Jackson arrive at an appartment to retrieve the case, before Jackson kills one of the occupants he reads out a passage from the Bible, ""Ezekiel 25:17.""It's so violent and brutal, it's unbelievable.Another disturbing scene is a rape scene which is clearly taken from the film ""Deliverance.""It involves Bruce Willis' character and Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), this scene is dark, wild and very disturbing.There is also a ""gimp"" involved...enough said.You watch this scene in horror wondering how the film industry can show scenes like this.Not to mention the scene where Uma Thurman's character OD's on the floor.There is one unforgetable scene which is where Uma Thurman's character Mia and Travolta dance at ""Jack Rabbit Slims Twist Contest.""Travolta who hasn't danced sine ""Grease"" delivers a superb performance and great dance moves along with the tune ""You Never Can Tell"" by Chuck Berry.One thing that will bug you about the film is ""what was in the case?""You never do really find out what was in the case,Quentin leaves you guessing, their is no real answer.Rumours suggest the diamonds from Resorvoir Dogs, Marcellus Wallace's soul.If you look closely at the back of his (Marcellus) neck you can see a rather nasty scar covered up with a bandage, this could be an incision where the Devil removed his soul?You never know.The only clues you get is a glow shining on Travolta's face and Tim Roth looking at it and saying ""it's beautiful.""I'll leave you to decide for yourself.I can't tell you how damn good this film really is.I can tell you this though, no one will ever make a film like this again.You've got sex, violence, humour, a story, if you can put all of these elements in a film your a genius, and Tarantino did."	5.0	WHAT A FILM!!!!	2001-12-15	5	3	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1P2NBM3P3TS2X	"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason"""	All in all an okay movie, but it gets a little bit tiresome too soon.  QT places far too much emphasis on making it look hip, stylish, and retro-funny.  At the end of it all, that is all it is  -- a self-indulgent, self-congratulatory exercise of a video store clerk's wet dream of a movie.  A bunch of movie stars gather to recite lines that make them sound cool, and some over-the-top violent setpieces that are an end in themselves.Film-student quality writing at best.  This thing won an Oscar for Best Screenplay?  Just because it is &quot;different&quot; and possibly irreverent doesn't make it award-caliber.Every scene should come with a voice-over that says, &quot;Hey, this is so cool, isn't it?&quot;, because that is the feeling one gets watching this movie -- that QT and company just wanted to wave their movie-making magic wands a bit and show off how irreverently cool they could be.  But it wears thin after a short while.Sure, plenty of folks have dropped plenty of accolades on this film.  But its success was as much a matter of fortuitous timing as anything else.  It was the right film at the right time in Hollywood  -- the ultimate Flavor of the Month film.

The dialogue is every bit as sharp and even though the movie has spawned imitators, nothing has since measured up.  This is an excellent DVD to buy because the Special Features are really worthwhile.  It has the standard making-of feature that s well done, but more impressive is the complete Charlie Rose interview with Tarantino and an episode of Siskel and Ebert after the release of Pulp Fiction where they talk about the Tarantino mystique.  The disc also has a bunch of print reviews of the movie and other stuff you might like.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A25LNKK0X36T11	John T hinman	"Aside from a my friend who walked in halfway through the movie and doesn't have any taste anyway, I can't think of anyone who's seen this film and didn't like it-if not love it. It is ultra-sexy and hip, and speaks volumes about Tarantino's directing abilities.The film itself is such a frank portrayal of the reality of criminality that you simply can't take your eyes off of it. The characters, who present that criminality through a script that is fantastically written, are unforgettable: Samual L. Jackson, as always, bites your head off with in-your-face, unbeatably cool dialogue that's worth repeating-one of my favorite lines has to be ""I'm a mushroom cloud-layin' motherf***er, motherf***er"". But of course, let's face it, Samual L. Jackson is just unquestionably cool. This was also a break-through role for John Travolta, who proved for the first time that he could do more than just dance and wear a leather jacket-now he could dance and kill people. Alongside these two eminantly hip hitmen also stands Bruce Willis as a renegade boxer, who has quite possibly the worst day ever. A worthwhile and genuinely creative use of Christopher Walken's weirdness turns out to be a very funny and instrumental addition to Willis's character as well. And how could we forget the seductive and strangely perfect role that Uma Therman fills, as she falls victim to her own indulgence and presents a very frank picture of what a drug overdose really entails. There are numerous other characters all of whom contribute to the richly fullfilling plot of the film, not to exclude Quentin Tarantino himself, who makes a fairly long appearance.On top of this, don't forget the perfectly executed sountrack and convoluted plot transgression that is one of many marks of Tarantino's imaginative abilities. All in all, there is far too much to say about this film but in short, it is a timeless, brilliant film that does seem to capture the essence of the 90's and the prolific existence of criminals and scoundrals in the world. There is dialogue that will make you laugh out loud, long exchanges that will make you think, and action scenes that are graphically real and unforgiving.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A35HF8V3AZR0O	Jon Ballenger	GREAT film. The perfect blend of humor, bullets, and dark realism to make this one of the films that I am proud to put on my list of favorites. The second in the lineup of Tarrantino's shocking and cooly hip films (the first being Reservoir Dogs, which I have also reviewed) is the absolute best. Three stories that are played in no particular order and somehow link together are what make up Pulp Fiction. The first story is about a hitman, a hitman's wife, a drug dealer, and one crazy night (I am not going to give too much away!). In the second, the subject is a boxer, a crime boss, a gold watch, and a pawn shop keeper. And finally, the third, is about two hitmen, a gun, a car, brains, and a paranoid suburban guy, who somehow has a problem with storing a headless body in his garage. I know that I did not go into much detail, but I want you to enjoy the twists, turns, and suprises that make up this great movie. Not for the squeamish or easily disturbed. A rough film, no question about it, but still one of the best in history. This is one of those movies that I would give 6 stars if I could.	5.0	Chock full of violence to satisfy the average American!	2001-12-17	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A217GK82I4WPC1	Jorge S	Pulp Fiction one of the  best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s.	5.0	Travolta's comeback	2013-03-11	0	0	0

Billed as Italian, though I'm pretty sure he's french Italian, it was a big hit in America and has a devoted cult following today.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A8KXTFN2EZIRL	"Justine ""movie fanatic"" Smith ""border_c2001"""	"You go into a Tarantino movie expecting irrevelent but thrilling dialogue, buckets of blood, spectacular writing and characters more real than you or me. Pulp Fiction delivers in every respect. It is pumped with energy and will keep you wanting more.Tarantino has an original formula to movie making, he enjoys his films as much as the viewer. The soundtrack is reminiscent of Easy Rider, it sounds like someone's favourite songs put together for the sake of using as many great songs as you can. Still, there is a connection between the music and the moving action. A different piece of music could have changed the scene entirely. Tarantino has a flare for matching music with the action, proof is the ""Ear Scene"" in Reservoir Dogs.The key element to the success of Pulp Fiction comes down to the writing. The story is non-linear, which can be difficult, but all loose ends are tied. You are not left with any questions about what might have happened to so and so. There is a feeling that you do wish to know a bit more, but that is just another demonstration of the skill in the writing. We are given enough to satisfy but there is that yearning to know that extra little bit. The dialogue is funny and fresh, more real than reality.The only fault that I can see in the direction of this film is sometimes wanting to be something it is not. Tarantino's influence's are sometimes a little too obvious, and it takes away from the film. With such original writing, it needs a style that suits it a little better. It works most of the time but every once in a while you feel you are watching another director's movie. It's all too familiar. This is nit-picking though, and should not discourage anyone from renting or buying this flick.This is probably the masterpiece of the 1990s, not as good as some profess but still a brilliant piece of work. It's entertaining and new, something that movies have been lacking as of late."	5.0	More than just Pulp Fiction	2005-03-03	1	1	0

It nearly had me in tears when I was an hour in and realized that there was still 2 more to go. I'm lucky I keep my hair short because by time I got down to the last 30 minutes I wanted to rip my hair out. It was the most boring piece of crap I have ever watched. With one exception if you are a stoner you'll love this movie blazed because I assume that when you are flying high you just don't care how truly terrible this movie really is.(Update) As requested I'll post some more information as to why this movie sucks. The plot is pointless. I understand the concept, but if I spend the whole movie bored because scene after scene goes on and on then it takes away any interest in the characters or what's happening.

From the first scene to the last, the audience is taken on a roller coaster that is going  backwards!  People are getting shot, stabbed, beaten and molested all OVER  the place.  With stars like John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Harvey Keitel,  Bruce Willis, and even a cameo by Quentin himself, this movie SIZZLES from  second to second.  Travolta is a hit man for Ving Rames' character and also  a heroin addict. When he takes Ving's girlfriend, played by the sexy Uma  Thurman, out to dinner as a favor and she OD's on his heroin thinking it's  cocaine-O MY GOSH-what happen's then and throughout the movie is AWESOME!  Keitel as the dutyful &quot;cleaner&quot;(didn't he do that in another  movie with Bridget Fonda?) is GREAT.  I can't stress how riveting this  movie is---YOU JUST HAVE TO SEE IT TO BELIEVE IT!

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2RN05UDH183AV	"K. Bourn ""bohemiangirlpdx"""	"""Pulp Fiction"" is just a classic!  This movie has some of the best dialogue of any movie I've ever seen:  Discussions about how intimate a foot massage is, $5 milkshakes, the differences between fast food in Amsterdam, Paris and the U.S., the art of body piercing, appreciation of good coffee, etc.  There's no way to explain WHY these topics are interesting.  ""Pulp Fiction"" just makes them interesting--trust me.The movie essentially follows four stories:  a romantically involved couple who also are hold-up artists, two hitmen, Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) on a job, Vincent's ""date"" with his boss's wife (Uma Thurman), and a boxer (Bruce Willis) who is paid to take a fall.  These seemingly unrelated story lines eventually weave back together, to a certain extent, and each is fascinating.Quentin Tarantino's decision to follow a non-linear plot also adds to the movie's interest.  Characters we see killed in a previous scene reappear later--because ""later"" is really earlier, chronologically.  Ultmately, the movie comes full circle, and it's quite a fun ride.For an interesting perspective on the movie, watch for the way the power shifts.  At any given time, there's usually one or two characters with power--and how the power shifts and who winds up with the power is fascinating.  This is especially true during Jules and Vincent's ride after their hit, their visit to Tarantino, a very put-out host and their encounter with Harvey Keitel, the ultimate problem solver."	5.0	Wonderfully quotable small talk!

This and ""Kill Bill"" are my two favorite Tarantino movies, it's great to see Pulp Fiction on bluray, well worth getting.  Brilliant masterpiece of filmmaking and modern cinema.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	ACL1M3MZMTL6D	kjm@continet.com	First of all, an awesome movie. Second, It seems that many of the people who write reviews have seen this movie numeruos times.  Well, I have a little theory and I would like to see if anyone else has caught on to it.  When Jackson and Travolta are in the guys' appartments retrieving  Marcellus' briefcase, Travolta opens the breifcase and there is a bright  shining light that reflects on Travolta's face.  He seems dazed and takes a  second to answer Jackson's question.  When jackson and Travolta shoot one  of the guys, the same light comes out of his body and reflects on them.  Next scene, we see Marcellus talking to Willis and his head has a small  bandage on it.  Is there a conection?  I think that there is. Terentino is  such an intellegent man, he would have not done these small things without  a reason.  The shining light represents the soul.  In the briefcase was  Marcellus' soul that the guys had some how got possession of.  Travolta and  Jackson's job was to retrieve his soul.Now, we know that there is some  reason for these small things Terentino added to the film.  I would like to  hear what others have to think about this.  If you haven't noticed, check  it out and write me back.  All emails are welcome!  Hope to hear from you.	5.0	Noticed the Bandadge on the back of Marcellus' head?	1999-06-16	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	Quentin Tarantino's ultra-hip film that put John Travolta back on the map is one of the most effortlessly entertaining films in cinema history. The top cast of Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis are all great in their decidedly off-beat roles. The unique approach to the material is played out in the grandest sense, with the &quot;backwards&quot; events and commendable wayward camera techniques. The classy soundtrack (one of my favourites) is equally impressive. At times confusing, it's a film that has to be watched several ways through get the jist of it. Tarantino's hard-as-nails direction makes this one somewhat hard to sit through. With the comical M.O taken with people getting four shades of guano blown out of them, it proves to be an uneasy watch. But it's enjoyable on so many levals, including counting how many time the &quot;F&quot; word is said. Zilch DVD extras, dissapointing for such a groundbreaking film.	5.0	Pulp Fiction	2002-07-29	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A356RFKNIG043B	K. Swanson	This is a stunning blu-ray with a perfect, glowing transfer and hours of extras. The dvd is a joke, and it's sweet that this truly one of a kind flick finally looks as it should. I first saw PF at the equally one of a kind theatre at the Tacheles in Berlin in 1995, and the marriage of this film with that art-punk squatters' collektive's wonderfully trashed out cinema, with the movie screened on a huge white wall and the seats a mish-mash of every conceivable sort of easy chair, sofa and recycled theatre seats, was straight out of Jackrabbit Slim's, if it had been run by some broke freaks. Everybody brought their own booze etc and the hazy air was awash with catcalls and laughter at the endless twisted jokes in this splendidly warped screenplay, easily Tarntino's best. I don't think I've ever seen a movie presented more perfectly in terms of subject and setting, so after a few minutes of watching the terrible dvd transfer years later I stopped it and decided I'd never see the film again and leave that perfect screening as my only memory.But then I found the blu-ray at my local library this week and saw that QT had done the transfer, so figured why not. Sure glad I did. This is a pristine image, absolutely stunning colors and definition, with lossless sound. Easily one of the best modern films on BD that I've yet seen. Along with the many little docs and interviews, it's what a blu-ray should be: stuffed to the gills with everything the 25 (or 50) gb format can hold.As for the film, well, what can you say? It started a whole new wave of auteur cinema, and remains as fresh as the day it was released. So many wild moments, especially the adrenaline scene. Travolta and Jackson are tremendous, and the extras show John talking about how Quentin changed his life with this role, and his love of JT's work. This is just one of those works of art where the stars aligned, and everything clicks. Walken always cracks me up, and his delivery of the asswatch speech is so hilarious. Keitel is likewise right on, as is everyone.I've never really dug the romanticization of the heroin sequence, but that's QT's karma and choice, so it's on him. At least the violence in this film is less gleeful than in many of his others. I just rewatched Dogs a while back, and must say that it was weaker than I remembered, while Pulp is even stronger. The focus on character here is the key, and that means the violence rarely feels gratuitous.Not a film for the overly sensitive in any case, Pulp Fiction is a real masterpiece, and it's wonderful that it looks so damn fine on blu-ray. This is how films should be treated for the home market. And at 9 clams here, it's a real deal as well. This film belongs in any collection of 20th century cinema classics, and in any collection of the best blu-rays released to date.	5.0	Excellent blu-ray version of a unique classic	2013-04-04	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3PQBIZ5F5XILO	"""kwortek12"""	The only thing I can say about tarantino is GENIOUS. The wonderful thing about this movie is the down-to-earth dialogue. You could listen to this movie as a book on tape and still laugh your ass off. And the acting is absolutely amazing. This is one of the best cast's I have ever seen, from Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Bruce Willis...to Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth and even a cameo from Tarantino himself. At first you think this movie is about somewhat important people, with them wearing black suits and all. And then you slowly realize it shows the storys of the Scum of the Earth and how these 8 people or so all interact and eventually mean a lot to each other by either killing one and other or taking their wives out on dates. I love the low-budgety look thats portrayed from the film, taking place in Urban neighborhoods in LA, bars, gun shops, and Locker Rooms. The best scene is by far the scene with Tarantino in his house, where they have to &quot;clean-up&quot; Marvin. Well I don't want to give to much away...but I guarantee if you see this you'll love it...or hate it its really up to you. But if you love it...see anything Tarantino.	5.0	My favorite movie, and it should be yours too...	2004-03-16	6	2	4

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1VFCX7D378LXO	Lana Durbin	Yes, let's all thank Tarantino once again for creating one of the most original, enjoyable, brilliant, and flat-out greatest movies ever made. Tarantino does have a psychotic way of expressing his originality in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (pervasive language, pervasive violence), but there's just something about this movie that makes you want to watch it over and over again. The kinky charisma between John Travolta and Uma Thurman alone is worth viewing this movie. Their dance scene at Jack Rabbit Slim's is (in my opinion) the most memorable.Bruce Willis fit into his role of prizefighter Butch perfectly. No one else could have done it like him. Samuel L. Jackson (being one my favorite actors) gave a powerful and stunning performance as hitman Jules. He always mamages to add the right amount of humor to his character. As I mentioned earlier, John Travolta (as hitman Vincent) and Uma Thurman (as Mia) mastered their roles and gave drop-dead amazing performances. Ving Rhames also gave a very powerful performance as Marsellus Wallace, Mia's husband. Harvey Keitel gave a masterful performance as well as his role of &quot;the Wolf&quot;. And may I not forget Christopher Walken (one of my most favorite actors of all time) whose monologue was the one of the highlights (if not THE highlight) and one of the most memorable scenes in &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; Unfortunately, Walken wasn't given a bigger part, but no matter what role he's given, he always manages to light up the screen with his superb acting. The rest of the cast which includes Tim Roth (as Pumpkin), Amanda Plummer (as Honey Bunny), Eric Stoltz (as Lance), Rosanna Arquette (as Jody), and Maria de Medeiros (as Fabienne) all give powerhouse performances. Hey, even Quentin Tarantino himself gives a cameo!Pure classic, pure entertainment, pure brilliance, pure originality -- &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; has it all!! See it. Love it. Buy it. Love it even more.	5.0	You can never go wrong with Tarantino!	2004-03-22	3	1	2
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3APP50IPJGWZR	Larry B. Mullins	Pulp Fiction. I can't say enough great things about this film. Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed it, and that in itself is amazing. Anything Tarantino does is amazing. A superb cast including John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, and Christopher Walken, to name a few. This is a superb cast simply because each actor (big or not) appropriately fills his or her role. The fact that the film covers 3 different stories which relate to eachother in some way, is just amazing. The story is told 'out of sequence'...which means you HAVE to pay attention, or you might get confused. Quentin uses a very unique and distinctive story-telling method which I feel makes him one of the greatest film-makers. Pulp Fiction is Tarantino's 2nd film, and showcases great performances wrapped in an excellent story with very real-to-life dialogue. This movie is dark, yet hilarious at the same time. Bottom line, Pulp Fiction is on my Top 10 All Time list, and is a film that you absolutely must experience.	5.0	Simply an Outstanding Film...	2004-03-07	10	7	3

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	ASSCA9IS0GWF5	Laszlo Matyas	Like any great work of art, it can be a bit difficult to write about a movie like Pulp Fiction. The movie has a kind of logic, an attitude, and a style all its own, a feel that simply doesn't exist in any other movie (not one that I've seen, anyway). It's hard to sum up exactly what's so incredible about it; sure, I could go on and on about the mouthwatering performances (seriously, is this cast a dream team or what?), the twisting mindbender of a plot, the jaw-dropping dialogue, the one-of-a-kind characters, or the instantly evocative set pieces, but there's more to it than just that. The movie is, in the truest sense of the phrase, so much more than the sum of its parts. Pulp Fiction is a world unto itself, a fantasy universe in which the most tantalizingly filthy aspects of American culture are transformed into high art. It's a world in which comic books, dime novels, gangster films, and surf music 45s are every bit as evocative and compelling as the works of Shakespeare or Da Vinci (seriously, I'm not exaggerating. This movie really has moved me to the same ecstatic heights that I reached after reading Hamlet for the first time). It's a movie that wraps you around its finger from the unforgettable opening scene and holds on to you until- well, it still hasn't let go of me. There simply aren't any bad scenes in this movie. Not a single line of dialogue that doesn't work. There isn't one lousy shot out of place, not a single moment that I seems like it can be improved. Now, I rarely fawn over anything the way I'm praising this movie right now, but then again, I've rarely ever experienced anything like this movie. It defies categorization. It's an absolute masterpiece. Get it. Watch it. Please!	5.0	One of the greatest movies of all time- no questions asked	2007-08-18	1	1	0

As Tarantino himself said, it is possible to like violence in movies and hate it in real life. A lot of people are like that, myself included. Violence in movies is not the same as violence in real life.That being said, I can move on and say that Pulp Fiction is probably the best American movie ever made. The plot is amazing, the visuals are eye catching and the acting is excellent. The movie leaves you feeling like it was too short, even though it's about 2 hours. It has a little bit of everything, and overall, it's just about as good as cinema can get.	5.0	Incomparable	2004-11-19	3	2	1

Pulp Fiction would be impossible to give praise to in words - there aren't enough, but I can say with it's star studded cast and stupendous dialogue it will remain to be one of the best films. EVER!Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames Amanda Plummer, Tim Roth and brief appearences from Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Quentin Tarantino - oh and did anyone notice Steve Buscemi as Buddy Holly? This gives the film enough talent to qualify for any award going, it gives it total solidarity and an extreme sense of superiority over any other film out.Other epics form Tarantino still hover over the 5 star rating but still don't compete, Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and the Kill Bill duo. His directing talent is profound and it show in this film.He won an oscar for best adapted screenplay and should have got more, I have no idea how Forrest Gump out did him, the soundtrack alone sholdd win it eleven awards but somehow it missed out.I have given it enough flattery, it will get more appreciated as it is taken from the valley of film darkness and is cast above the clouds in film heaven, and just for the record I hope the makers of Forrest Gump realizes just how lucky they are to getaway with their academy awards, because it is clear to everyone Pulp Fiction the 1994 classic is a thousand times better.	5.0	"""Zed's Dead Baby, Zed's Dead"""	2004-11-15	1	0	1

When Pulp Fiction came out in 1994, it not only caught people's attention, it blew up in thier face! Tarantino became an instant genious, and the movie, a classic. The film is one story about three stories, showcasing a brilliant cast, with John Travlota, Sam Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Bruce Willis. The brilliance of the film lies in Tarantino's ability to create likable characters doing very unlikable things. The strong suit in the film is the dialogue, which is hardly ever related to crime, showing that even criminals have real lives. Named on AFI's 100 years, 100 movies as one of the best films in the last 100 years!

It was the most original movie to come out in a while, one of the most widely respected and critically acclaimed genre films of all time. Tarantino almost single handedly launched the careers of Samuel L. Jakson, and Uma Thurman. He revived the career of John Travolta, and introduced Amanda Plummer to the U.S., all be it a very small role she delivered a wonderful performance.If you like genre films, great dialogue, colorful characters, or hearing Samuel L. Jackson say 7 different variations of the f word. You should watch this movie. I have seen it hundreds of times... It's that GOOD.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AYMZTWBG0V53W	"Leslie Karen Rigsbey ""Leslie Rigsbey"""	"Tarantino, the whiz kid of the New Illiteracy and the even newer wave of cinema ""geniuses"", is actually a very entertaining screenwriter. The dialogue in ""Pulp"" is heavily laced with profanity, but much of it is so funny it is hard to care about that. Samuel L. Jackson is an unacknowledged genius of an actor, and Travolta, for what it's worth, was the perfect lead character to play opposite of him. Where ""Reservoir Dogs"" is savage and cruel (and those are its good qualities), ""Pulp Fiction"" is actually more enjoyable and approachable. It's always easier to pet a dog when he isn't trying to bite your head off. I can't say that ""Pulp Fiction"" is truly innovative in terms of story--anyone can write a long form story and rearrange its components in a non-linear flow--but no one writes funnier lines than Tarantino (move over Blatty). I think it's unfortunate that he can't quite make the transition to comedy director. I don't mean idiot stuff (like ""Four Rooms"" or ""Meet the Parents"") but rather more story-driven, humorous narrative fiction. I think Quentin has lost his way with these tawdry homages ""Death Proof"" (or as I like to call it, ""100 Proof"") and ""Inglorious Basterds"", but ""Pulp Fiction"" is a movie that I can watch and enjoy almost anytime. I guess it goes to show what can happen when talented actors are on board and when great individual scenes are written for them to get into. Even the violence in ""Pulp Fiction"", while quite strong, is surprising and handled a bit more imaginatively. It's certainly a film to take one by surprise, so I am definitely giving it a strong recommendation, despite some over the top moments. (And yes, the syringe to the heart scene is more humorous than scary.)"	4.0	I have to say that I enjoyed it...	2013-05-16	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3SC0N6NSY0JUB	"Lillian Marquez ""Imperial P"""	This movie is as cool as it gets.  From the cast and their unforgettable dialogue, to the music and unorthodox timeline...  all of it work together beautifully to make an entertaining movie which has stood the test of time.Packaging is the bare minimum...  but since I'm not the biggest fan of such things, it doesn't bother me. What I was really looking foward to was the transfer to 1080p and whether the sound would push my audio set up. Though I was aware that the audio would not take advantage of my 7.1 audio, I was hoping it would still impress at 5.1... and I was not disappointed.The music sounds great, and the few scenes where the action gets loud (namely when Vincent Vega and Juels let their guns loose in the iconic collection scene) sound rich and crisp. The audio pops.I waited to pick this up for $3.99 during Black Friday week. It was on sale last year as well, but I missed out on the sale and wasn't in a hurry to pick it up since I had it on DVD already. The Blu-ray is definitely the definitive version.Great pick up.	5.0	As good as I remembered...  except it's now in HD.	2012-12-11	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AYZLXLVMJGTJV	L. J Nary	I think Quentin creates films that are masterpieces of creativity, just like Kubrick uses imagery. This film has really great characters who just come across with dialog that doesnt so much ring with wit but with imagination. The film uses actors who just turn their roles into scene stealers again and again. It is about gangsters who work for the big boss Maurice. Maurice doesnt show up too much except for a cat and mouse run that turns into a trial of shame and pain for this heavyweight criminal. Willis doesnt say  too much, but he reflects his nonverbal as stoic until he turns into a baby talker with his uniquely attractive french girlfriend with a very round apple face. The two main thugs are Fishburne and Travolta, they both do a good job. I like the way Fishburne uses his speech and articulates so eloquently, he finally feels his bible verse during a murder raid, which will change his life. He decides to become a savior to another mixed up couple during a coffee shop burgler gone wrong. Travolta and Thurman are the most inventive and I loved when they share an intimate outing with drugs overtaking the real connection. They do the twist at a rock a billy diner with the old caddy cars as booths for the lucky few. Keitel plays an organized yuppie sweeper almost seen as godlike by his fame of handling dirty jobs so perfectly. He has a short take but its another creme de le creme character. The things I liked were the cool connection of the Travolta and Thurman, the twist and the fun of showing off their style. I liked Thurmans camera director meeting with him. She displays this air of creativity and in the moment fun even though on a high. Filming is fun, I liked to do little short character takes or shooting your friends like an interview. It was different. I liked the coffee shop. I liked the motel with the anonimity and intimacy they shared, with the overcast skies. I liked the thought of a big breakfast with blueberry pancakes and sausages with lots of maple syrup. I liked that they could go anywhere and experience great adventures like Bora Bora. I liked that Willis went back to help the oppressor out of so much degradation. I liked the way Fishburne wanted to walk the planet, meeting others sharing moments and being open to life. A must see flick.	5.0	Quirky and Cool	2010-07-25	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3NZVCL9N8CLHB	"Logical Paradox ""Irrational, but True"""	"When ""Pulp Fiction"" hit the screens it instantly ignited a firestorm of praise to writer/director Quinton Tarantino. A man who is now a household name, the bains behind ""Jackie Brown"", ""Resevoir Dogs"", and most recently: ""Kill Bill"". Pulp fiction launched his carear and made a huge impact on hollywood.One of the big things that makes a tarantino film a tarantino film is the story. Tarantino writes AND directs his own stuff and is as talented a writer as he is a director. This comes out well in Pulp Fiction, where the story, and it's telling, are center stage. The story involves 2 hit men played by John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson, A boxer player by Bruce Willis, A powerful gangster and his wife played by uma thurman, a sexually dissedent cop named zed, a charasmatic problem-solver called the wolf"" and a highly prized suit case, the contents of which are only ever mildly implied. A myriad of different tantalising stories of these very well defined and different characters are displayed to us in a non-chronological order, untill they all criss-cross paths and collide, as the story moves forward to shock us and then backward to reveal sidenotes and close plot gaps.While Tarantino certainly could have shot the movie in a linear fashion and still made a hell of a picture, as an artist he knew telling it in such a fashion would be more entertaining... and it is! You absolutely must watch the WHOLE movie, and pay attention, this isnt a movie you can watch while talking to a friend on the phone, but you will be greatly rewarded.The story is sort of a black comedy with elements of a serious crime drama. You'll laugh at things that arent really funny and other times it might actually make you think. What is a constant though is witty and intelligent diologue and characters that are sometimes very bad people doing very wrong things while they talk cassually or over-analyze social manners and practices in an almost ""seinfeld-like"" way. The diologue can be about nothing and somehow still be compelling and keeping you lusting for more.But it's not just diologue and creative story telling, but there's real humor and brilliant scenes that anyone who watches it will never forget. Watching John Travolta argue with his drug dealer about who should be the one to give a shot of Adrenaline into the heart of Uma Thurman who has ODed is not only very amusing, but unforgettable. The performances by the all-star cast are OUTSTANDING by any definition of the word, and all bring real personality and nuances to thier well thought out and interesting characters.Pulp Fiction is a yardstick by which to measure similar movies. Many compare it to films like Snatch, Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, and others. But Pulp Fiction is truly in a category of it's own.The Collectors edition DVD is excellent. Deleted scenes complete with comentary from QT as to WHY they were cut and other details. Loads of extras, great quality, and even a menu for ""jack rabbit slims"" (watch the movie). Everything about this movie AND this DVD edition tell of a man who truly loves movies, and loves every conceivable aspect of making them."	5.0	Tarantino's Masterpiece!	2005-01-13	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2W00XKTTF1G0Z	"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa..."	PUPL FICTION is a film that you'll either love it or hate it. It has violence (implied) and language that is quite obscene and blatant. But this film has something that none other does, great performances by characters that are the lowest of low and saying things in the a way that makes them real and sympathetic to the audience. Quentin Taratino (Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown ) directs - and plays a small role too - this film that many have said it one the best of all time.It has three separate stories one with John Travolta (Saturday Night Fever, Look Who's Talking, Michael) and Samuel L. Jackson (Star Wars Episode ! & @, Pulp Fiction) giving some of their best performances and their careers.....another with Bruce Willis ( Die Hard, 6th Sense) and Ving Rhames (Don King, Mission Impossible ) and yet another with Tim Roth (Planet Of The Apes 2001, The Musketeer) and Amanda Plummer (TV's LA Law, Joe Vs. The Volcano  ) . They are all intricately intertwined and cross each other paths with the seemingly witty talents of Uma Thurmon (Batman & Robin, The Avengers), Christopher Walking (America's Sweethearts, The Dead Zone ), Harvey Keital (Red Dragon, Little Nicky), Rosanna Arquette (The Big Blue, Joe Dirt, The Whole Nine Yards) and Eric Stoltz (Mask, Anaconda, Hercules).The performances are superb. The story is raw and the action is non-stop. There is tension, costumes and mood all over this place. There is implied graphic violence, drugs and a lot of swearing! Not for the week of mind or easily offended. It is amazing interesting and riveting at times. This hyperactive director takes you on this hyperactive ride rather well.The DVD extras are excellent as well. Quentin himself guides through the selected scenes and why they were deleted. There are several good behind the scenes of the production, history and story of the film. It also has the original Siskel and Ebert show that featured Pulp Fiction as well as many, many DVD rom features that includes interactivity with the script.I really liked this movie because of the performances Travolta and Jackson are incredible and even Eric Stoltz shines in this one. Be warmed - there is a lot of adult language...this is not for anyone under 13 - and maybe for those in high school. Parents - watch it first and then you decide if it is appropriate for your children.	5.0	A Clever, Yet Gritty Film. Travolta and Jasckson Shine!	2002-09-15	4	0	4

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A22RY8N8CNDF3A	"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist"""	"Pulp Fiction is inspired by the old novels of the same name.  The characters in the movie remind you of the 1930's -40's cheap crime novels full of familiar characters like boxers willing to throw a fight, mob bosses, calculating wives and bank robbers like Bonnie and Clyde. Tarantino is the director and must have tongue in cheek throughout!Pulp Fiction is set in Hollywood in the 1990's and combines three stories that focus on two characters.  The first story is about Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson). Jules quotes Ezekiel 25:17 to his victims before blasting them.  Jules and Vincent are two hit men that work for Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames).  Marsellus has a beautiful wife, Mia (Uma Thurman).  Marsellus wants Vincent to entertain his wife and takes her out to a 1950's themed restaurant.  She takes a liking to Vincent, and is also a drug addict.  She overdoses and the scrambling and the scenes scrambling saving her from death are hilarious.  The second story is about a boxer who is asked to throw a fight (Bruce Willis) by the big boss Marsellus.  He decides to make money himself by doing the opposite and wins the fight, killing his opponent in an early round.  The third story is about a pair of lovers (Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth) who discuss a career change from robbing banks to holding up a diner.  They decide a diner is easier and more money.There is also an interesting character named Wolf (Keitel).  He is a mobster cleanup man who instructs on how to do the job.The film's stories weave in and out, there is a lot of dialogue that is mesmerizing.  Talk about Big Mac's in Paris and why someone was killed because he massaged the feet of big boss's wife, Mia.  Sometimes the dialogue goes so long you know it is on purpose - like a rhythmic ""riff"" to the ears -  The movie is original and bright though the theme is dark in the noir way.There are lengthy scenes presented out of sequence.  I don't know how the movie is held together unless the a feeling of the playfulness of the actors as they enjoy their characters.The final scene brings the movie together - ties it in a neat little package."	4.0	Playful Mobster Comedy and Cool Dialogue	2010-02-27	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2SGR7LE899LGG	Luigi	I watched this movie in 2005 (I never saw it before) and the reason I finally did see it is because most people I know told me how great it is. Well, I can confidently say that this movie is nearly a piece of wasted film. Aside the over the top bad language used (more than needed) what this movie really seems to do is to numb your mind to the extent that killing other people is just a cool thing to do. As far as deep meaning or constructive message to the public there are none. Also the beginning and end of the movie are looped togheter, however the overall plot development feels like reading only the middle chapters of a book with no true direction. The idea that this movie is liked by so many clearly shows the direction that society seems to have taken. Overall: PURE GARBAGE.	2.0	You got to be kidding me!	2005-03-27	22	5	17

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY	MacheteJason	Pulp Fiction is a fantastic film. I don't want to spoil it for you so I will review the Blu-Ray. Pulp Fiction ports over almost all the extras from the DVD Collector's Edition into this package. The quality of the video and audio is excellent. There is a total of almost 4 hours of bonus content with over an hour of HD extras included. The only things missing are 2 minor featurettes (Production Design-6:22, Behind the Scenes Montages-10:46) from the 2-disc DVD.Special Features:- Not the Usual Mindless Boring Getting to Know You Chit Chat (HD; 43:01)- Here are Some Facts on the Fiction (HD; 20:37)- Vintage Pulp Fiction: The Facts - Documentary (2001; SD; 30:31)- Deleted Scenes (SD; 24:30)- Siskel & Ebert At the Movies: The Tarantino Generation (SD; 16:00)- Charlie Rose Show (SD; 55:27) - Very Good interview with Tarantino and his philosophy.- Independent Spirit Awards (SD; 11:29)- Cannes Film Festival - Palme D'Or Acceptance Speech (SD; 5:20)- Marketing Gallery (SD; 16:13)- Still Gallery- Enhanced Trivia TrackBuy the 2011 US Blu-Ray or 2009 Swedish international import version that works in region 1 (North America). The Swedish import has held its value well. Pulp Fiction fans will be pleased to UPGRADE THEIR DVDs. It is one of the best Blu-Ray releases for supplements. My only complaints would be the bland packaging and absence of a director's commentary (since director Tarantino doesn't do them for his own movies it's not going to happen anyway).

After looking at IMDB for some of the best movies of all time, we came across Pulp Fiction. It wasn't available through streaming on any other service but Amazon. So we decided to give it a try.The movie has a lot of different things going on that you eventually piece together at the end. There are a lot of intense scenes in the movie as well as some quite funny parts. This movie screams Quentin Tarantino from the start. If you are a fan of his movies, this is a must-see. Others may not feel the same way however it's definitely worth a watch. You never know, you may like it. Regardless, it's a classic.	4.0	Definitely worth watching.	2013-03-25	0	0	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	As this movie already has hundreds of reviews (many by much more knowledgable movie fans than I) I just had a few brief comments on this film, mostly related to a particular aspect of the movie that I liked that I hadn't seen discussed yet.Probably Tarantino's best or at least well-known film, the movie is filled with ironic twists of fate or perhaps ironic juxtapositions (I'm not sure what else to call it). For example, the two main characters (played by Samuel Jackson and John Travolta) are a couple of amiable hit-men who are perfectly friendly and civilized as long as you're not on their little list of people to eliminate, as they go around cheerfully discussing philosophy, sex, and the meaning of life while offing their boss's enemies. But Travolta himself comes to an untimely demise after sitting on the pot after leaving his gun in the kitchen when Bruce Willis goes back to retrieve his father's watch. The watch makes an interesting symbol, because neither Travolta nor Willis has time to lose messing around with, in Travolta's case, nature's call, or in Willis's case, sentimental keepsakes. Marcellus Wallace, their employer, is busy trying to screw the boxing fans by fixing fights, but he in turns gets, well, the same treatment from the two B & D types in the store. Not to mention what happens to Wallace when Willis in his car meets up with Wallace in the crosswalk, and the fact that Willis double-crosses Wallace by refusing to throw the fight, thereby double-crossing the double-crosser. And so on and so on. I enjoyed this clever and funny aspect of the movie and it probably remains my favorite among Tarantino's films. Plus Harvey Keitel is great as the guy who can fix even the worst of Travolta and Jackson's screw-ups and misadventures.	5.0	A few brief comments	2005-02-05	3	1	2
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AVO4FZPATK8TI	manatoc	"Can a carefully crafted film, with a lot of thought put behind it, still be a bad film? Yes. Pulp Fiction is a case in point. At the core of each story fragment is an emotional vacuum that gets glossed over by the clever use of filmmaking gimmickry, self-consciously devised cartoon violence and quirky writing and acting. Tarantino uses these devices to distract the viewer from the fact that his film is emotionally and spiritually pointless and hollow. Could that be the point? To be pointless? Perhaps so, but if being pointless and spiritually hollow is the aim of a film or any creative project, that's a sad commentary on the creator. For a similar effect I prefer to watch Warner Brothers cartoons. They are funnier, more inventive, more artistically satisfying, and there is no element of self-consiousness in the violence. In other words, when I see the violence in a good cartoon, I don't think ""Oh my God that's so funny."" I simply laugh. See the difference?"	1.0	Everyone says it's a great movie!	2011-11-20	61	5	56
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1D2AXVN20OQZD	Marc A. Coignard	This type of movie was made for a certain type of people.  Although I can't exactly say what that group of people is, you'll get what I mean if/when you see it.Pulp Fiction is one of the most creative and  entertaning movies of the 1990s.  It stands apart from most crime  dramas/action flicks ever made, and is definately a treat.  Some accuse it  of having no plot, and no heart and sould.  So?  Is it not a great feast  for the eyes and mind still? Great Story line (or lack thereof) and great  acting.This may sound odd, but PULP FICTION changed my life.  I saw it  when I was 15...4 years ago.  At that time, I was still trying to figure  out where my life was going and what I wanted to do in and post-high  school.  After seeing PULP, I realised that I wanted to do that...I WANTED  TO BE A FILM MAKER!!  I had never seen anything like PULP, and I still  haven't.  But, after seeing it, I realised that there is more out there  than what was in front of my face.  Everything from movies, to comic books,  to music seemed different.  After seeing PULP FICTION, I was much more  willing to go out and see new forms of art and experience new things.  The  Theater, Literature, and Indie and Forgein film all seemed much more  appealing after this movie.  I hope one day I can do a movie like this (not  in subject matter, but instead in value of quality).	5.0	A great film!	1999-09-13	3	1	2

It's a long movie that quickly goes by with its whirlwind of dazzling dialogue. The acting? First rate. It's one of my favorite movies where I wound up wearing out my deluxe VHS version (sadly, in pan'n'scan).I obtained the 2-disc 2002 DVD version when it was first released. And, to me, the art of making deluxe editions such as this have fallen by the way. The slipcase and the folding DVD case is very nice. And it includes a 16 page Booklet and a menu from Jack Rabbit Slims.It may not seem like much but those little trinkets, especially that menu, that add to the background of the film. So, in my case, it's a great film. But I could care less about a ""Royale With Cheese"" (yuck). I'll have a Jackrabbit Slim's Double Deluxe Speedburger with a Five Dollar Milkshake."	5.0	The classic deluxe 2002 DVD!	2011-10-31	2	1	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AJBVY9K7D1AZ4	Mark Gatzke	"I can still remember the first time I saw Pulp Fiction.  Between trying to put the chronology together and absorbing the bizarre and seemingly disconnected events, I was completely hooked right to the end as everything finally came together and finally made sense.  The term ""made sense"" must be used loosely in this case, since everything that happens in Pulp Fiction defies its standard use.  Lets just say it wasn't until the end that I ""got it"".One would think the better part of enjoying a movie like this would disappear after seeing it once.  Oddly enough, this is one of those weird films that seems to find its way into the player when I can't decide on anything else, and is just as enjoyable as when I first cracked the plastic.  Even after watching it more times than I care to count, the bizarreness of each tangled mini-story and how strangely they come together is enough to make it a fairly regular favorite.  It would be too hard to explain this movie to even come close to spoiling it for someone who hasn't seen it.  Suffice to say, it's a roller coaster ride that never lets up.There are warnings for the squeamish of course.  Quentin Tarantino's reputation was built on this and other unconventional efforts such as Reservoir Dogs, From Dusk Til Dawn, and Kill Bill.  If you don't care for an overabundance of violence, drug use, foul language, or perverted sex, stop right here and get on with your life.  If you're still reading, get ready for a wild ride like you've never had."	5.0	One more gush of many...	2007-02-14	5	3	2

I don't like swaggering attitude and this film has it in spades. There's a lot going on in it and it all comes to ....what?  Samuel L. Jackson is good as a Bible spouting hit man but John Travolta is awful. I nicknamed him John Revolta after seeing this. The only interesting set piece was the 50's diner. That was cool. Watching Travolta and Uma Thurman dance was not. The intertwining stories are unpleasant and violent to the extreme. There's a lot of name association here. Like everyone HAD to be in a Quinton Tarantino movie. Tarantino thinks that by dunking the audiences' head repeatedly in a stinking garbage can will entertain them. Not me. &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is by far one of the most overrated excuses for a movie I've ever seen.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A17BUUBOU0598B	"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies"""	"This movie is enjoyable on a number of levels.  It's very entertaining on the surface level.  There's so many things going on and so much variety that it's easy to watch and stay curious.  For those who like to study film, there's enough interesting elements here to explore.  All in all it's well worth watching.This movie is not without its shortcomings.  Quentin Tarantino is a terrible actor.  Some of the dialogue is very out of place.  The movie is overwritten in that respect. A lot of characters, from Bruce Willis' girlfriend to the drug dealer played by Eric Stoltz, talk way too intellectual for their parts.  Not to mention the gratuitous use of the N word.But, if you suspend judgement, this movie is fun to watch.  Even the bad elements are funny.This movie does jump around in time line which gives you perspective on different characters and how they experience things that happen in the movie.  It starts in a diner and ends in a diner.  Of course there's a lot of drugs, killing, one liners and bad jokes in between.  But a lot of that craziness adds up to some funny moments.It's also cool that so many retro elements were incorporated so well into the movie.  Jack Rabbit Slims, the throwback 50s restaurant Travolta and Thurman eat in, is very cool.  The dance contest scene is definitely one for the ages.It is a bit of a stretch to call this one of the best movies ever, as some reviewers have done.  Suffice it to say that it's a fun movie to watch and interesting enough to be considered ""good.""  Those expecting ""one of the best films of all time"" will be disappointed.All in all, if you got a few hours and you want to see a movie with great camera work, some funny and scary moments, and enough variety to keep you interested, Pulp Fiction is worth a watch."	3.0	Great Entertainment, Worth a Watch.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1M0790P4AE96W	Mark_Young	I can watch this movie a million times, and never get tired of it. It keeps my attention every time, and every time I see something new.It never gets boring and you're never left wondering what's going on.  There's no elaborate action scenes, no aliens or monsters, and no  gratuitous sex scenes; only conversation. Real conversation.Everyday, people have pointless debates about things like foot massages and  so on. The average person doesn't know quantum physics or rocket science,  that's what makes most movie conversations unrealistic. But the characters  in Pulp Fiction are real people.Their everyday talk is intriging,  interesting, independent of the plot. It allows you to identify with the  characters rather than take their word for it.The genious behind  the movie is actually a simple idea. Tarantino takes story which spans two  days, cuts it into four pieces, each ending with a revelation of some kind,  and re-arranges them. So after you watch the movie, you're forced to think  about it, and are dying to see it again.You can see how this movie  has influenced others. Pointless conversation has become apparent in a lot  of newer movies (Suicide Kings for instance), and if you've seen Pulp  Fiction, you can understand why.My suggestion to the reader; buy  this movie and turn it on whenever you get bored. You'll never see the same  movie twice, instead you'll see similar movies, with slight differences.	5.0	The greatest movie ever.	2000-01-31	0	0	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2D6RJ7JLZP4ZP	"Martin Greenberg ""movie and game guy"""	"PART 1: Film reviewThis is one of those films that come along so rarely that one must savor them when they eventually do. Quentin Tarantino screenwrites and directs to an incredible high. This film has some of the most poetic cursing in any movie. The dialogue is extremely carefully written. Without being preachy, obnoxious, or repetitive, it reveals relationships between characters, plot points, and details without overtly saying anything. The conversations sound realistic and are often laugh-out-loud funny. The script is flat-out brilliant. The film, like most of Tarantino's films, is told out of chronological order, which adds a degree of infinite watchability as you try to spot both the ways in multiple retellings of the same event differ (this is done deliberately to show different viewpoints and interpretations of the same event) as well as little clues that tell you how to reconstruct the story, like when you might see something from a scene you just saw or something you saw at the beginning of the film happening in the background of a scene shown separately.The acting is fantastic. Samuel L. Jackson is unforgettable as a hitman who quotes the Bible before executing people, and then later reinterprets the quote he uses, and, in turn, his entire career (and, in a way, the ""point"" of the film and even what it specifically is about). John Travolta is equally fantastic as his partner, in the role that revitalized his career so late after Grease was released. Uma Thurman is as she always is, which is effortlessly cool, calm, and collected no matter what her character is doing. The role is written for her, and it's exactly the kind of person that only she can play. Bruce Willis is just awesome in the chronological last part of the movie, entitled ""The Gold Watch"". It's the slowest part of the movie, but it creates a strong sense of the relationships between the people in the movie and the content of their characters, as well as revealing what drives these people to do what they do in the way they choose to do it. As it moves onwards, it begins to turn around on itself, as characters interpret things that have happened, and this forces you as the viewer to see everything in an entirely new way. The way Tarantino's script simultaneously tells an interesting story so well while creating memorable characters without even telling the story straight is remarkable. The film is two and a half hours long, but you won't be watching the clock. It's that good.PART 2: Product reviewThe previous releases of this film had been lacking, with extremely poor transfer from the master recording, bad contrast, and oversaturated colors. The sound was also noticeably bad in other releases. The Collector's Edition is the best transfer yet by far, with cleaned up video, a fresh transfer, and Dolby 5.1 surround sound. No problems here.Secondly, the special features are remarkable. In my opinion, no movie has ever included such a complete and immense collection of extras. From full-length documentaries about the film and crew, to reviews, many photo galleries, a Charlie Rose interview, an episode of At the Movies (with Ebert and Roeper) about the impact of this film. Plus, there's even a fun trivia subtitle track that you can turn on that gives a very large number of intriguing facts about each scene as it plays. An incredible package of extras that seems to be unparalleled by almost any other film release to date.Overall, excellent film, great quality audio and video, plus amazing array of extras. The price is right, too. You can't go wrong with this."	5.0	Wow...just wow.	2009-06-12	3	3	0

That way you have a general idea what the characters are saying, and can pick up a lot of vocabulary.  Thought it was a bit pricey.  My big beef is that SpotlightMedia sent me a case that was dog-eared.  And I'm not talking about the printed, dog eared look that Quentin Tarentino had printed on the packaging.  I mean that the case was obviously damaged, and sold as a collector's item.  The only reason I give three stars is that the video does have the content as listed.

Pulp Fiction DVD owners should try something new when watching this film. Try watching it in chronological order. Set your DVD player in Program mode, set and play the chapter in this order: 3, 4, 21, 22, 23, 24, 1, 25, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 2, and 26. If you play the chapters in this order, you will clearly see that Pulp Fiction is a Tales from the Crypt type of storytelling. You will see four tales of absurdity and you will clearly see that if John Travolta's character would have listened to Samuel Jackson, he would not have been killed by Bruce Willis.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AESY8NCX6VS6O	M. Burns	"The rocky terrain of film in the 1990's can be summed up in one fell swoop with Quentin Tarantino's magnum opus of pop culture, four-letter words, and overlapping time frames. It's a grand journey - two days in the L.A. underworld guided by hitment Vincent Vega (Travolta) and Jules Whitfield (Jackson), boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), and a dream cast of colorful supporting characters (including Harvey Keitel as the mysterious but resourceful Mr. Wolf). And even when the nearly 3-hour ride gets dark and violent, it's impossible to miss the tongue-in-cheek hilarity of Tarantino's colorful and endlessly quotable screenplay (""I'm gonna get medieval on yo' a$$""). Submerged in director Tarantino's deep love of film, it plays like a gift to cinephiles of all ages that thankfully never fumbles into parody or blatant tribute. Instead, Pulp Fiction takes its inspirations and molds them into something entirely original. It restores one's faith in the future of film itself - so much that nothing better has even been seen yet."	5.0	A Modern Masterpiece - The Best Movie of the Past 20 Years	2003-07-04	0	0	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A124Z4X54I01ZW	MCooke	What can I say?  This is probably my favorite movie ever, so I'm admittedly a biased reviewer.  There are so many quotable lines.  Did someone say &#34;Royale with Cheese?&#34;  In fact, I just watched it again 2 nights ago.  I never tire of texting my friend quotes from this movie and seeing what quote he will respond with.I could watch Pulp Fiction once a week and never get bored -- and I'm not someone who likes to see many movies more than once.A note of caution:  If you have a problem with foul language, sexuality, or scenes of drug use, definitely sit this one out.  But if you don't mind a generous sprinkling of f-bombs, some on screen violence, and clearly adult themes, this is a fantastic movie.  Such a riot.  But definitely for adults only in it's warped humor and it's scenes that somehow mix comedy with disturbing violence.Product came on time as advertised.	5.0	Awesome movie	2013-12-25	1	1	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	"I will admit I loved this film, and didn't originally buy it for myself - but I'm definitely keeping it now! But what I don't see is why it's considered such a cult. (Sorry) Maybe I'm not seeing it. I did see similarities with Trainspotting, with all the drug taking, and Quentin Tarantino had a certain je ne sais pourquoi about his directing. I loved how when he was first introducing characters, he only showed them from behind, and all you could see was hair (Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames - or no hair in his case).When the film first started, I was feeling a bit iffy about it all. And then the soundtrack kicked it. It's amazing how you've never seen a movie before (honest) but you know it instantly about the soundtrack! And then the film really kicked off, and I found myself enjoying it. And it has some great music in it (guess what I'll be getting next?) I found myself humming along to ""Let's Get Together"" by Marvin Gaye (mainly cos it was used in another movie, Down To You), so I definitely think this soundtrack will be great.My favourite bit in the whole film was Uma Thurman's joke. I'm sorry, I really like corny jokes!!! I was in fits throughout the rest of the film - it should really have been shown more towards at the end of the movie, cos I'm sure I missed a good bit after the joke was told! I was literally crying afterwards! For anyone who missed it, or hasn't seen the movie:Three tomatoes are walking down the street. Daddy Tomato, Mummy Tomato, and Baby Tomato. Baby Tomato is lagging behind, so Daddy Tomato goes back, squishes him, and tells him to ""ketchup""!I'll never hear the word ""ketchup"" in the same way again. I think my main problem was I kept seeing the image in my head. It's such a funny image.The person I was most shocked to see in this movie was Bruce Willis! Why didn't anyone tell me he was in this before? I definitely would have seen it long ago! He was quite sexy in it, apart from where he was first introduced - he never moved a muscle, and looked a real hard nut. But he became more gentle and tender when his girlfriend was introduced, and the way he acts towards her will make any girl go weak at the knees! He was definitely a cutie in this.The most memorable moment from the whole film (apart from Bruce Willis coming out of the shower - HELLO he moved too fast, you nearly get a glimpse of something! Will need to watch that slower) is the moment that is always shown in TV shows etc, publicising this movie. It's what I know it for, and that's the tiny dance segment between John Travolta and Uma Thurman. Funny how Uma shakes her pretty black bob a lot during this, but it there's never a hair out of place - tell me that was a wig!Towards the end it does get a bit confusing, but thankfully, unlike some other films, it does tie all the loose ends up, and you're satisfied at the end.Definitely a must-see, although try and replace Johnny Boy with the guy he was in Grease. I may have to watch it a few more times before I consider it a cult."	4.0	A cult classic?!	2004-02-03	1	1	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A26JO34AUDBVC3	"Meg F ""2 cents worth"""	I've heard how this movie has become a cult classic, but had never watched it till tonight. Now I know the catch phrase about Quarter Pounders and some of the various other cultural references that I see that come from the movie. I finally Tivoed and watched a tv version with lots of the profanity bleeped and probably some of the more violent scenes trimmed. If the full version showed Bruce Willis in more nudity, then I'm glad to have passed. Frankly I couldn't stand to watch it all because it was just flat boring to me. I'm not sure if maybe it was supposed to have some interesting shock value, but mostly it was just boring. Did I miss something by not getting the full shock effect with the edited tv version?The dialogue was frequently tedious and I found the scenes just dragged on and on. YAWN! I couldn't care about any of the unappealing cartoon like characters, but not sure that I was supposed to do so. I found myself fast forwarding to speed up my cultural review and afterwards skimmed an on-line copy of the script to see if I'd missed some amazing line that would make the movie better, but I didn't.The movie wasn't completely predictable and had quirky characters, so maybe that made the movie refreshing to many. That isn't enough to make a good film for me. I am frankly boggled why it is so popular or won so many awards. The scenes being out of time sequence was annoying. Mostly I just found it boring and frankly was quite disappointed after all the hype I've read. So... as with most movies, it isn't for everyone. I've seen a lot worse, but main reason I'd recommend someone watching was just to get the cultural references vs really expecting to become a fan.	2.0	Trying to figure out why this is so popular	2004-08-29	23	10	13

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1AYN3IIUNQCIA	"Melanie Edwards ""book worm"""	i have seen many movies but this makes the top five. it is so juicy, so entertaning, so mezmerizing, so hilarious and so damn cool, its a full blown movie section its self. this is defenatly Tarantino's block buster film that made him into the director he is. this film is about two hit men, there bosses wife, and a boxer who all meet there fates in 48 hours. its all jigsawed up and it takes you a couple to times wacthing it to get the picture but its still entertaining. so the hit men story tells of them picking up a briefcase with something very valubale in it that we don't see but know that is pulp, then they cover up a murder, and finaly get cought up in a resturant heist. the bosses wife story goes on a date with one of the hit men, gets herself almost killed, and get stabbed in the heart to save her from dying ( a little confusing but just wacht the movie) the boxer story is about the guy who is paid to throw a fight, ends up killing the guy, gets kiddnaped and almost raped, and rides of with his wife. all these storys are intuined into one 152 long movie that just blows your mind. so if you want to see the 1990's movie that brought back the story telling gernes like the godfather, bonnie and clyde, the exorcist, and ben hur, then go see pulp fiction, one of the greatest movies made.	5.0	a knock out film	2004-12-07	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3L51TJ5BFKJ59	"M. ""Gorehound"""	Well today was the first time I actually sat down and watched Pulp Fiction for the first time (with full attention) and I have to say.....I was blown away. Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that has that timeless qaulity that will have people watching it 30 year's from now, and it will still have the same effect on those people that it has on people now. It is an abosolute masterpeice of experimental/independant cinema, extremely ahead of it's time, and mile's away from what anyone was doing at the time. Quentin Tarantino is a director with his own original style that could never be replicated or imitated, and you can't say that much about director's anymore.The great thing for me about Pulp Fiction is how it play's out as a modern day exploitation film. Tarantino's infuences really shine through here, for year's I've heard about all the movie's that influenced him, and they all could not be more apparent. Pulp Fiction has that retro 70's vibe only found old exploitaion movie's and bad-a** action movie's from that era. As a big fan of those film's myself it was great to see a modern-day filmmaker incorporate those influences in a new way ,and I applaud him for doing so.Of course one of Tarantino's trademark's is his great use of dioluge. I think people enjoy this for a two reason's; 1. It's refreshing to hear the character's in a movie actually talk like real people would talk. 2.  It's just funny/interesting dioluge, plain and simple. It say's a lot that a director can make an amazing movie without abundant amount's of flashy editing and special effect's.Overall Pulp Fiction is an amazing, and most importantly, original masterpiece of experimental cinema that will continue to 'wow' viewer's for year's and year's to come. Highly recommended.	5.0	Masterpiece of independent/experimental cinema.	2007-11-21	5	4	1
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1CDNTB7377YH2	Michael A. Newman	"Anyone who has seen the Kill Bill movies can understand Tarrantino's style.  This one has a series of stories, some of them related and most of them with John Travolta.  One of my favorites involves Travolta and Samuel L Jackson who shoot a guy in their car.  They need to clean themselves up and get rid of the ""mess.""  Enter Harvey Keitel as a take charge kind of guy who approaches the problem like a swat team giving everybody orders of what to do, how to do it, and how long each step will take.Another tale involves Bruce Willis trying to guard a watch that was handed down from his grandfather to his father and then preserved by his father's friend (Christopher Walken) in his rectum during internment at a POW camp.  Willis trying to get the watch back gets into a big fight with a crime boss and while they are fighting they are captured by sex fiends for torturous games.The movie breaks all rules and like Blue Velvet, is like no other movie I have seen before.  I have seen the movie 4 times and seem to pick up something new about it each time I see it."	4.0	Different but great!	2005-01-26	1	0	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AF2PA1H6CXY8I	Michael Brown	Being a fan of non-traditional film, I really wanted to like Pulp Fiction.  And with a cast that included John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis, how could it go wrong?As for strengths, Travolta's Vincent and Jackson's portrayal as Jules are first rate, as are performances by virtually all of the first-rate supporting cast.  And Jules' character reveals a nagging belief there is more to life than selfish reaction.But for the most part Tarantino chooses to shock us rather than make us think.  Don't get me wrong, there is much truth in this film, and his insight into fringe society is keen indeed.Perhaps that is what diminishes my favor for this film.  With the exception of Jackson and Willis, the characters are too true-to-life.  Many of the fringe element are social wastelands and have no regard for human feelings, rights or even life.  There is no depth, merely a philosophy based on pragmatism, opportunism and control.  And I personally find such a personality revolting and distrubing rather than interesting.Some try to shrug off this overlying tone and declare this film a comedy.  I could not arrive at that conclusion.The movie is a must-see for the acting performances and soundtrack, but is not for the young, impressionable or faint-of-heart.	4.0	Disjointed look at life on the fringe	2002-04-09	2	0	2
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2ZLROGIL2V7GV	Michael Crane	"Words cannot express how much I love this movie, but I will try my best.  ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of my favorites.  Quentin Tarantino is a very gifted director/writer.  Although I love his directing, I must say it is his writing that really impresses me.  But I will get to that later on in this review.I think it's safe to say that the first time this movie was released on DVD, it was a little more than disappointing.  There were no special features, sound and picture was so-so; I mean, my laserdisk at least had three different trailers of the movie.  So, of course, I was very excited to learn that this movie was being re-released in a fully loaded special edition.  Re-buying the movie was well worth it, for this edition of the movie is far superior than the other one.The movie really consists of three different stories; not in any order.  Any one of the stories could be their own little movies.  The players are two hitmen, a boxer, the big boss, the big boss' wife, a crazy gun store owner, a gimp, a cop named, Zed, a man who makes problems go away, and a little suitcase with ""666"" for the combination.  You add all this together and you get one hell of a movie.The acting is more than superb; including one terrific cast with some heavy hitters (Travolta, Jackson, Thurman, Willis, etc.).  Tarantino is a master when it comes to writing and directing.  Especially when it comes to writing.  I have never heard such clever and brutally honest dialogue in any other movie.  I have said it before, and I will say it again; Tarantino reminds me of Raymond Carver, except with more humor.Now, on to the special edition of this DVD.  Is it better than the previous version?  YES!  Tons of special features, and not to forget the fact that the movie has been restored in high definition.  Picture looks very clear.  And the sound is also a lot better.  You can watch the movie in DTS, which is always a good thing.Special features.....where do I begin?  There's a ton of them!  It's not even funny how much stuff is loaded on this bad boy.  And every one of them is great.  Features include a documentary, an interview with Tarantino on ""The Charlie Rose Show,"" trailers, filmographies, and many more.  If you love special features, then you will not be disappointed.""Pulp Fiction"" is a great movie, and the new DVD edition is outstanding in every way.  If you still have the older DVD of this movie, get this one now!  If you haven't seen it yet, check it out when you can!  Of course, with any other movie, there is a chance you may not like this movie.  That's fine, nothing wrong with that.  Don't let hype ruin your preception of the movie, just watch it as if it were any other movie.  You like it, great; if not, well, at least you gave it a shot.  Filled with sharp humor, great characters, outstanding dialogue, and some of the craziest surprises and twists, ""Pulp Fiction"" is a wonderful film, and will continue to be one of my favorites."	5.0	"""Oh, I'm sorry.

If you are a fan of Tarantino's work, then you know that this is by far his best writing and directing.  One reason I love this movie so much is the all star cast.  When you have a team that involves Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, Travolta, Kietel, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, your not going to have a bad movie.

From Jackson's thoughts on religion and retirment, to Willis' thoughts on his father's gold watch, the acting is great.One thing that could turn people off in this movie is the graphic nature of it.  As i posted before, if you are a fan of Tarantino, then you will have no problem with this movie.  For those who are not used to Tarantino type films, it may come off as a shock.  I fell in love with the way that Tarantino directs and the way that he writes.  The way the movie jumps around back and fourth, and then at the end all comes together I think is genius.  If you want to see something like you have never seen before, give this movie a try, and if you are like me, it will give new meaning to the term ""great movie""."	5.0	Zed's dead baby...Zed's dead	2006-02-01	3	2	1
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A18SK3MXF1UDZU	Michael W.	"This is Quentin Terantino's finest work. ""Pulp Fiction"" is in a class of its own as regards the body of his work. It holds up over time extremely well, and is far above the remainder of his self-indulgent, ego-centric work, including the ""Kill Bill"" fantasy volumes.I would enjoy this movie on the basis of the performance given by Samuel L. Jackson alone. You'll see a ""young"" Tim Roth, joined by a cast that has, to their credit, gone on to do even finer work. In the gangster genre, this is a must see that stands with other classics. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a rare and well executed glimpse into the world of 'small time' organized crime. It has has qualities beyond those found in comparable films. The particular release I am reviewing is no longer offered, and the new ""Pulp Fiction Two-Disc Collector's Edition"" replacement product will give you the full content of this older version.This movie is very well done, and stands with others of its genre such as ""GoodFellas"", ""Casino"", etc. As the complete ""Godfather Trilogy"" is the king of all Gangster movies with richer context and context, it may not be compared to it at all, in my opinion.If, and only if, you're purchasing an older, likely used, two-disk release: I watch it with no problem whatsoever on my Sony Bravia HDTV in one of its wide screen modes, without distortion. I do so without filling the screen vertically, without difficulty. Simply stated, I will not watch video that is obviously degraded by various methods of ""stretching"" the content in order to fill the screen, so worry not and enjoy."	5.0	This is Quentin Terantino's Finest Flick to Date	2008-12-22	1	0	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3ST4QHEB6LEO9	Mike B.	If you the type of that hardly buys movies because you won't watch them again, own this one, because you'll end up watching it again.Pulp Fiction is a story about redemption as different characters and story lines collide.  Two thugs (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson) go on a wild ride trying to get a brief case for their boss, but you never see what's inside.  (You can figure it out if you look for all the clues but its very hard).  Meanwhile a Boxer (Bruce Willis) is on the run because he refused lose a fight after being paid off to take a fall.Pulp Fiction is great movie full of action, some suspense, and often downright hilarious in parts as Quentin Terrantino, Harvey Keitel, and Christopher Walken all make appearances.  The scenes are out of chronological order during the movie, but that fact only adds to the movie overall.An exciting story combines with some real acting star power talent to make for a great movie.

This movie had me wanting to walk the earth, you know, walk the earth, meet people... get into adventures. Like Caine from ""Kung Fu"", just so i could get into conversations and practice dialogue such as this.Of course, not all conversations are gonna go smoothly like in Pulp Fiction  and there are going to be ignorant people who get angry and are ready to blow, to them i say.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3QLAOOTFEHCJI	M. Oleson	"Quentin Tarantino raises the bar after the excellent ""Reservoir Dogs"" with this ultra violent crime drama.  I guess what makes Tarantino interesting is that his excess in violence is augmented by goodly amounts of humor and wit.  In this multi-faceted take on organized crime, the primary focus is on 2 hit men.  One is a black man with a jerry curl (Samuel L. Jackson) and his partner is a white dude with stringy long hair (John Travolta).  Their business is strong arming people and killing them if necessary.  They work for crime boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames).The movie opens and closes on a restaurant where a ""wired"" couple (Tim Roth & Amanda Plummer) are in the process of robbing all the customers.  In between the two scenes with get the hit men botch a hit on drug suppliers holding out on Marcellus.  It's graphic but hilarious at the same time.  Then in one of the great scenes in film, Marcellus wants Vincent (Travolta) to squire around his antsy wife Mia (Uma Thurman) for the evening.  Not wanting to risk anything with Mia, Vincent injects a little heroin.  After the classic twist contest at the rock `n roll diner, Mia discovers what she thinks is cocaine in Vincent's jacket and snorts it.  A no no.  She goes into convulsions, so Vincent takes her to his dealer where the famous scene where they inject adrenaline directly into her heart takes place.In another tangent storyline a boxer (Bruce Willis) is set to throw a fight at the order of Marcellus.  He doesn't so he must escape quickly after the fight.  In an unlikely coincidence Marcellus and Butch (Willis) run into each other at a stoplight.  They nearly kill each other but stumble into a KKK/Nazi-style pawn shop where they are bound and gagged and prepared for...well, rape.  Tarantino's movies aren't like any other.  There is nothing ever traditional about them.  They purposely go way over the top.  The detail is finely honed, right down to Jules' (Jackson) wallet in the final scene.  Watching this movie 18 years after its release, I'm still entertained and exhilarated.This single disc Blu ray has an excellent 2.35:1 video transfer and a DTS-HD Master Audio sound layer in 5.1.  For some reason I had to crank the volume level up a few notches more than usual to get all the dialog.  There are plenty of additional features including interviews, critic's retrospective evaluation, a couple featurettes, a clip from Siskel & Ebert's ""At the Movies"", award show footage, deleted scenes and more."	5.0	Still one of the great flims	2012-02-21	2	2	0

There are so many things I love about this movie I'm afraid this review won't do it justice.  If you've seen Kill Bill and enjoyed it, you'll most likely enjoy this 1000 times more.The plot is perfect in every way.  You gain a great amount of respect for each individual character as the movie goes on, and really begin to care about them.  At first it seems that none of the characters are connected, but slowly they all come together in one hell of a finale, by which time you feel like you're a changed person.  I can't say enough nice things about this movie, it's amazing.  The film is also darkly funny, I found the hardest I laughed was at Christopher Walken's brief appearance, which ties into my next point.The cast of this movie is awesome.  John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis all give great performances, as do all of the rest of the cast who play smaller parts.  A movie is always better when you like the entire cast, and when everyone in the cast just seems to fit well together.The movie is also characterized the the music, the cinematography, and the overall raw feel that it has-- I loved every second of it.  It has such energy and passion, you just can't help but stare at it.  Because of Pulp Fiction, I think of Quentin Tarantino has earned a place on the list of &quot;Best Directors of All Time&quot;.  I urge you to see this movie, you won't regret it.	5.0	Stunning	2004-06-27	2	1	1

As soon as this Miramax Collector's Edition graced the department store shelves, I knew I had to have this one also. This 2 DVD set has great features, the feature I hold most useful is the interview with Roger Ebert. There is a portion called the Tarantino Generation which is very interesting to all Quentin Tarantino fans. Another good thing that eased my purchasing of this after I already own the other version is the ... rebate for upgrading to this collector's edition. There is no doubt whether or not film buffs should own this movie. So the only decision there is to make is which version to buy. My main point being that this DVD edition is clearly superior to the regular edition.	5.0	Clearly Superior	2003-01-23	4	0	4

It is more like an exploitation of the modern thinking inherent in Hollywood culture.Pulp Fiction does not satirize the Hollywood culture. It succumbs willingly to that culture and successfully spreads its meaningless violence [and plot] across all the characters viewed in the film. Even Samuel L. Jackson's character's (who wants to give up crime for some sort of holy vagabondage) conversion is somehow assimilated with moral aestheticism.Pulp Fiction asks for total suspension of disbelief, and attempts no psychological exploration of character. Pulp Fiction also has a message ""What a lark crime can be!"" an unsavory joke that murder should be viewed as somehow a fine art.In closing, Uma Thurman just can't dance..."	1.0	Coolness revealed in a form of autism.	2002-10-29	67	26	41

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2XRZV63X79YSJ	"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector"""	Let's start by saying most people think Quentin Tarentino is a genuis or a hack.  I feel closer towards the later.Stanley Kubrick created the non-linear time movie with his masterpiece, The Killing.  The reason that it worked in that film was that Kubrick used this technique to simplify the storytelling.  He took each scene to its conclusion.  Then went to the next scene from the start even if it was before the conclusion of the last scene.In this film it is used as a way to cover a mediocre script and direction.  This film was not editted in time sequence.  The film jumps back and forth in time with no reason.  For example, there is a scene where one of the characters is killed and five minutes later he is alive again.  The reason why, who knows for sure.  The one thing is that most people who loved the film usually are talking about all the graphic violence not the plot.Critics hailed this film but most were not talking about the movie by the film maker.  This is another case of critics wanting to create a new star (and in their own way become the one who discovered him.)  This was one where they talked or wrote more about Tarantino and not the film.The one good thing in this film was a stellar performance by Samuel L Jackson.  He is one of those actors that Hollywood doesn't know what to do with and he once again shows his great talent. (But I would say don't waste your money on this if you are a fan of his there are many better films.)If you want to see a great action pact film with great style then get Kubrick's The Killing, Danny Boyle's Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie's Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrells.	3.0	Samuel L Jackson shines in this mediocrity	2006-02-25	6	2	4

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2ZVERVFM25MJT	"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283"""	In less than a decade, 'Pulp Fiction' has become a cult classic, making many people's top ten films of all time.  Not only was it a highly impressive second feature but it made Quentin Tarantino a real big Hollywood player (especially after the fantastic 'Reservoir Dogs') and it didn't just ressurect John Travolta's career but it made him cool again.  There's countless moments in it to treasure, many of which have even become famous, especially Travolta and Jackson's conversation about the Royale with cheese.  Cult movie fans should also be acquainted with the debate over what really was in that suitcase: diamonds, a human soul or even a Royale with cheese!The story has three basic threads - revolving around two hitmen (Travolt and Jackson), a boxer (Willis) and a couple robbing a store (Roth and Plummer).  The cast itself is formidable, with Thurman and Travolta being especially good.  Yes it's violent, and has set off various arguments over the validity of such thrillers as valid cinema.  The truth is, this grips you from start to finish, and proves beyond doubt that Quentin Tarantino is a force to be reckoned with.	4.0	Cult indie	2002-01-30	16	13	3

The film is filled with rich dialogue and performances.A neat 3 story line ingeniously woven into an unforgettable movie. John Travolta and Samuel Jackson became instant box office gold from their portrayals of two hit men in this film and Travolta's career went from almost nonexistent to top dog. Eric Stoltz portrayal of a stoner drug dealer is pitch perfect as is Rosanna Arquette as his wife. Bruce Willis as Butch the boxer is also in top form and Uma Thurman has never been better. The smaller character roles by Roth, Plummer, Keitel, Walken and Rhames are equally impressive and there isn't a false note in this ultra entertaining rollercoaster ride of a movie.Tarantino's sly use of tired story lines that he turns upside down is nothing short of genius! It's a film that needs to be seen several times to be fully understood. If you haven't seen it you have missed one of the best films of the last 20 years.The two discs set sports an excellent transfer and has a ton of great extras including commentary, on screen facts, excellent deleted scenes explained on screen by Tarantino, trailers, TV spots, Siskel & Ebert show devoted to Tarantino, Charlie Rose show devoted to Tarantino, on the set documentary, feature-ette, montages and the list goes on and on!	5.0	A MODERN CINEMA MASTERPIECE!

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A33CRCBPTQPRBU	Mr.Reviewer	Since this was the first time I ever saw a non-sequential movie like this it was exciting for me to try to make sense of what was exactly going on and when it was exactly going on. It also helped me to see the story the way real life events happen, by happening with no seemingly connection to one another but upon closer inspection everything is connected.However, I'm not sure that's exactly what was intended but that's what I walked out with.Another thing that shocked me about the movie was the callousness of the characters. It made me almost disgusted on how their are real people out there who have such little value for anything except money and power.There's not much else to say on this film since the story line isn't really that interesting and the characters are fairly one dimensional. Certainly worth watching one or two times but I wouldn't call it a classic.	3.0	Chapters on Suffle Mode	2002-03-11	4	1	3

I'll admit, at the beginning of the movie I was confused. There were all these strands of a plot flying all over the place. But as the movie progressed, they all settled into one coherent story. Especially the ending - It made all those strands meet together with an extremely satisfying click. You'll need some time afterwards to fully digest this film, but once you do, it's awesome.	5.0	Great movie in the end	2013-01-27	0	0	0

In the 30's you had Wizard of Oz; in the 50's ""On the Waterfront""; the 70's had ""The Godfather"" and ""Star Wars"" and the 90's saw Pulp Fiction shake up the world in much the same manner.  ""Well, maybe if I had some Lava.""  ""I hate to break it to you, but this isn't the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.""  ""You don't like pork...what are you Jewish?""  ""Royale with Cheese!""  I could list the incredible, camp quotes for pages and pages, but you get the idea.  The movie set the trend for all the copycats that would follow.  It's definitely not the mainstream movie that most seminal classics are, but it has a beauty, an identity, and a stroke of mental manipulation (i.e. direction) that I have never seen, and we may never see again.  All one had to see, to note how incredible this movie was, were the long lines to the awful follow up Jackie Brown.  The mainstream will be confused by this movie, but those of us who engage in storytelling know what this epic did to the world."	5.0	Best Film of All Time	2002-04-26	4	1	3

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2A610MMWI5WIC	"Myles Christiansen ""myles_christiansen"""	As a beginning screenwriter, I am dismayed at the popularity of this movie and its four-and-a-half stars average rating on Amazon.  Poor dialogue, little surface and less beneath....  But, as I have been reading most of the reviews here, I have come to the realiziation that most who like this movie would also claim that McDonalds is one of the finest restaurants one can find in whatever community they live in.  The reviews of those who rate Pulp Fiction only a star or two consistently have their reviews rated as not helpful.  And that is one of the poorest qualities of our society, and of Pulp fiction cultism: everyone likes to jump onto the bandwagon, without much thought (as went into this movie, beyond the cheap borrowings from others more creative), and then, again without thought, react negatively to those who don't agree.  We tend to like that which is popular, even if it's not particulary good... until the bubble bursts.	2.0	McDonalds, the Finest Restaurant	2006-02-19	30	10	20

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3DDPQ9342UNMY	"N. Doyle ""film buff"""	"PULP FICTION is the sort of tale right up Quentin Tarantino's dark alley of a fictional mind. All of his criminals speak the profanity-laced dialog with such effortless ease that it seems perfectly natural after the first five minutes to hear the ""f"" word and the ""n"" word spoken with regularity by a very competent cast of actors. There is no such thing as political correctness in his vocabulary, so it's an audacious piece of work.Tarantino weaves the tales of several characters, not all of whom are related, until eventually the tales do dovetail together to make a common pattern out of the jumbled narrative. It's all done in brisk, good story-telling style to keep the viewer interested throughout the two-and-a-half hour running time.The dark humor is present in almost every situation you can think of involving murder and mayhem and somewhere, in all the Bible readings that SAMUEL L. JACKSON quotes, there's a message about redemption that seems to be the raison d'etre for the final scene in the diner.UMA THURMAN has delicious fun with the role of a gangster's moll who sniffs a little too much white powder in the ladies room while on a date with JOHN TRAVOLTA. The two of them get a chance to demonstrate their prowess with romantic comedy in this wonderful sequence where they go to a '50s-theme restaurant with an art deco ambiance and some '50 icons like Marilyn Monroe, Ed Sullivan and Mamie Van Doren doing their stuff while platters are served. They also indulge in a twist dance contest which, naturally, they win.It's the lightest moment in a film with plenty of dark twists and unpredictable shoot-outs that are a blend of violent gore and gales of laughter. HARVEY KEITEL has a fine time with the role of a ""cleaner-upper"" who gives instructions on how to wipe the blood off messy crime scenes. BRUCE WILLIS is excellent as a boxer who fails to lose the match and has to go on the lam to escape the wrath of a crime boss. His brutal treatment at the hands of a sadistic hardware store owner and his sick pals is one of the most lurid episodes of the many layered story. They don't call this ""pulp fiction"" for nothing!! Despite the disturbing scenes of violence, it manages to be a highly entertaining mix of crime and comedy that keeps rolling along toward a satisfying ending in the diner where the first scene involving TIM ROTH and AMANDA PLUMMER took place.Summing up: More likely to have broadest appeal for young male viewers who like their crime stories raw, real and unpredictable. Original, inventive and understandably awarded a great many honors when released."	4.0	Darkly humorous tale laced with profanity and corruption...	2007-09-16	1	1	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	After scoring a critical indie hit with Reservoir Dogs, writer/director Quentin Tarantino stunned moviegoers with 1994's Pulp Fiction.  Tarantino assembled one of the finest casts ever envisioned, and bracnhes the film into seperate yet interwoven stories; all of which have an underlying theme just as Tarantino's other films have (Reservoir Dogs was honor among thieves, Jackie Brown dealt with survival, and Pulp Fiction dealt with redemption), and Pulp Fiction became an international hit for Tarantino and Miramax Films, while resurrecting John Travolta's career and making Samuel L. Jackson a household name.  The ensemble cast also includes Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Maria de Medeiros, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken, Bruce Willis, Phil LaMar, Julia Sweeney, Peter Greene, Steve Buscemi, and Tarantino himself.  Samuel L. Jackson nearly steals the entire film (he was robbed of his Best Supporting Actor Academy Award nomination for this), and you can't help but feel for some of the characters.  Travolta was nominated for Best Actor and the film was up for Best Picture among other nominations.  This new DVD Collector's Edition is a great buy, but if you already have the older edition of Pulp Fiction on DVD there's no need to run out and buy this, the extra's really aren't that special to warrant a second purchase of the film.  All in all, Pulp Fiction is a modern day American classic that will make you laugh your head off while your not asking yourself &quot;Did I just see (or hear) that?!&quot;.	5.0	An American Classic	2002-09-15	7	2	5

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1	newfound32	Wonder boy Quentin Tarantino's second film, PULP FICTION, became the standard-bearer and trendsetter for cinema in the 1990s. The tangled story centers on and around two philosophizing hit-men (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson) and their dark adventures entertaining their boss' drug-addict wife, and killing off his failed business partners. One of these partners is a prize fighter (Bruce Willis), who actually wins a fight when he, well, wins a fight; one that he had promised to lose, and lives to bask in the anonymous glory.However, unconventional as the story lines are, the plots are not the point of this picture. In fact, despite the off-the-beaten-path plots, the events depicted in this film leave one with a sense of emptiness and unfulfilled expectation. Nothing happens in the film that matters, perhaps, because so much does happen, that the viewer is desensitized to the moral ramifications of the acts that are depicted. What ultimately redeems this film and, in fact, raises it above the league of most commercial movies is that it is so well crafted and audacious in its approach that it stands as a uniquely fresh masterpiece in American cinema.Among the film's strident innovations is the elegance of the dialogue given to otherwise despicable characters. But, vying for equal attention is the ubiquity of stylized violence and the glorification of low values (such as drug use) that seems to pervade this film. Additionally, Tarantino, the product of a leading film school (U.S.C.), is adept at staging visually-lush sequences. One of my favorite and most innovative shots, for instance, involves the Bruce Willis character's conversation with Jackson and Travolta's boss (Ving Rhames). For the entire scene, especially, the first, extended shot, the camera avoids the conventional head-shot of Rhames while Rhames is talking. Instead, the camera focuses on Willis, who remains silent for several minutes, minimally responding to Rhames' dialogue with understated facial expressions. In another unusually staged scene, John Travolta delivers a soliloquy in a bathroom about why he should not go to bed with the boss' wife.Tarantino's movies are also distinguished by the quality of their sound tracks. Pulp Fiction is no exception, being a trendsetter in its use of ultra-hip, and sometimes, revivalist choices. Of course, this `retro' philosophy is echoed in the casting choices that are made in his films, as we note that Pulp Fiction breathed new life into John Travolta's screen career, while tapping also new talents, such as those of Samuel L. Jackson. Finally, Tarantino's films are also distinctive in the way in which they develop a story line; they are seldom linear, stirring up disparate subplots, which are synthesized together by a meandering, often non-consecutive time line.All of these elements in tandem - the clever dialogue, the rarefied violence, the retro soundtracks, and the unconventional story arches present us with a bold, new vision for movie making. Let there be no doubt; this movie is not for every palate. And, social critics have charged that its casual dispensation of gratuitous violence has led to a coarsening of our culture. But, putting aside those concerns, there can be no denying that Tarantino has taken film into previously uncharted waters.PULP FICTION is the best effort so far that Tarantino has made to challenge and invigorate the cinematic arts in America. Every scene in this movie is powerful enough to stand on its own. In combination, however, they make for a very powerful film; one that overcomes the challenges that it, itself, raises. A must get DVD.	5.0	Say what again! I dare you!!!	2004-05-19	1	0	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2ETWB58VSTXQY	"Nick Bobraton ""The Land of the Jeff"""	This really is a collection of short stories put together into one melting pot. However, the stories intertwine with each other in some way. The 1st story involves two hitmen, played by John Travolta (his ONLY good movie), and Samuel L. Jackson (the man). For awhile, it shows them having an interesting conversation about fast food in Europe (Trust me, it works), and going off to kill a few idiots who screwed over their boss. After this, it goes into a story of a retired boxer who killed another boxer in a fight. The strange thing is, he is in aquatinance with the boss of the hitmen. You still with me? After that, a series of simple, yet really cool plot points follow, with some truly disturbing scenes. Certainly not for the squeamish, although fans of Resevoir Dogs should check it out. Also, Harvey Keitel is in his best role since Mean Streets, and almost steals the show. Great movie, great soundtrack, just great. Don't try to make a big deal out of the movie.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AGRZQGF4IOWN7	"Nick Dawson ""Movie Man"""	With a cast of John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis, it would be hard to beat this movie in any shape or form. All you really have to do is see that Quentin  Tarantino wrote and directed it, and you would know it was a winner. No doubt, the director did put in some risks by putting the scenes in non-chronological order, but if you have a good memory, you will have no problem with this movie. This movie doesn't really have a plot, but each scene ties with another. If you like the Kill Bill series, you will definitely love this movie.	5.0	You want to watch a great movie?	2005-01-26	4	3	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A22M7MF3BZ0692	Nick	Although i have only seen pulp fiction once (i have not owned it long) I still love and talk about some of the funny lines.  Pulp Fiction has multiple plots that intertwine within each other and still has the classic Tarantino Flashbacks.  Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta are low rent hitmen, Bruce Willis is an upcoming prize fighter, Uma Therman is their bosses wife and Ving Rhames is their boss.  Bruce willis is supposed to lose a boxing match but ends up killing the guy in the first round.  His boss gets angry with him so he gets one of his men, John Travolta to kill Bruce Willis but things dont work out so well.  Also, before that John Travolta gets an order from his boss to take out his wife, Uma Therman.  After eating at Jack Rabbit Slim's, she gets into his heroine and has an overdose.  Good jokes, good acting, and a good story make Pulp Fiction a sure fire hit.	5.0	Another Tarantino Hit!!!	2003-10-23	2	1	1
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3NQI2JLNPFOF8	"nico_laos ""nico"""	"""It's movies like Pulp Fiction that glorifies sensless violence and portrays it as something funny.  I'll never be part of something like that."" -Natalie PortmanThe above quote is typical for people that don't like this movie.  They can never just not like it....they always have to start some crusade against it.  Oh, go away.  If you don't get it then watch something else.  If you don't like it than say so and move on.  I, personally despised the movie, Van Helsing.  I hated it with ever fiber of my being.  But I'll leave it at that.  I won't talk about how it signifies 'the downfall of moral society'.  Let's move on.If you've never seen this then you most likely have heard alot about it.  You know it re-launched Travolta's career.  You know it contains a mysterious suitcase.  And you might even know that the story consists of 'chapters' that jump around out of sequence.  What you might not know is that the each and every scene is a little movie in of itself.  A little masterpiece.  The car ride in the beginning, the walk to the apartment door, the conversation with Brett, any scene where there are people sitting down eating, Marcellus Wallace's talk with Butch, Christopher Walken's talk with Butch, the cab ride with Esmerelda, and so on, and so on.  The movie's full of them, and each one of these scenes is it's own little masterpiece that can exist outside the movie.  They are, in fact, their own short films inside a bigger film.  And THAT'S why this movie is so great.  That's what keeps people so entranced at the stroytelling.During a New York premier of Pulp Fiction, a woman went into cardiac arrest after the 'adrenaline injection' scene.  The woman recovered and was fine but in an interview when Tarentino was asked to comment on the incident....he said, ""Whoa....keeping an audience interested is one thing.....but stopping someone's heart?  That's good f****ng movie-making!"""	5.0	watch it over and over and over and over and over	2004-10-08	7	5	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AHXHBS0FVREDG	"""noisy_crickette"""	Butch (Bruce Willis) is a boxer who kills his opponent after being told to lose the match by his boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Travolta's character is to take Marsellus's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out for a good time while he is unavailable, and he has an incident with cocaine abuse and overdosing. Outside of that, Travolta's character is Samuel L. Jackson's character's partner. They are hitmen. Other great cast members include Tim Roth, Rosanna Arquette, Harvey Keitel, and the man Quentin Tarantino himself.Tarantino is an amazing director/ producer. He is truly a genius. This movie is so mixed up, though. The entire cast is perfect. This is one of my all-time favorite movies.	5.0	Mixed up!	2003-03-09	5	1	4

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	ANG18IVI90N1D	NYC Sean	Aside from the many great reviews there are a few ones that claim that Tarantino's plot is stolen from foreign films. I say : Who cares? I mean, are we going to critizise William Shakespeare, who copied all his plots from elsewhere? No, we recognize him for making the stories his own, like Tarantino does so wonderfully.Pulp Ficton is a great movie that tells the tale of two hitmen, a boxer, and a mob bosses wife and the things that happen to them over the course of a day. The movie has no real life lessons and if you have no real problem with violence or bad language is a lot of fun to watch.	5.0	Why do you whine?	2005-05-15	8	4	4

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3A4M34UQDJPG9	Omagus	There are two ways to look at PULP FICTION.  You can look at it as just a movie, or you can look at it as a movie that revolutionized the way movies were made.  If you look at it as a film by itself, it is a great movie.  If you look at it as a revolutionary work of art, well it's still a great movie.Many people have listed PULP FICTION's merits:  awesome cast, outstanding dialogue, the way Quentin Tarantino was able to put this together for such a low budget.  Some people have also stated how important the mixed chronology is.  However, I haven't really seen anyone discuss WHY the mixed up time is so essential to the film.The reason is because of this:  towards the end of the movie (as viewers see it) Vincent and Jules are discussing something that happened to them earlier that day.  One of them decides to make a life changing decision while the other doesn't.  Based on those decisions, one of them dies.  While it happens later chronologically, it was actually shown earlier in the film.  Seeing their dialogue at the end puts everything in a whole new light and gives viewers a whole new perspective.  Had Tarantino made a more standard movie, the effect wouldn't be nearly as interesting and attention grabbing.The only really bad things I can say about the movie are not about the movie at all.  Because of its success, later filmmakers tried to copy Tarantino's style instead of just trying to make good films.  Also, after this movie came out, a lot of white kids started thinking that it was ok to use the n-word.  However, I blame neither PULP FICTION nor Quentin Tarantino for either of those.  He made a good film and it should judged for itself.	5.0	Pulp Fiction	2005-08-07	4	2	2
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A4UUD0LKLMACK	Ophelia	Probably the best known, if not the best tarantino film (i leave that to your personal preference) and it has one lone review!?!  I have to write this if only to honor one of the most influential films of our times.  tarantino is one of my most favorite directors, from schlock to high art.  If you haven't seen pulp fiction, next to maybe reservoir dogs, this is one of his greatest films.  And i have seen almost all of them.  His tributes to various genres cannot be overlooked.This is an incredibly well-cast film with a multifaceted plot that is carried incredibly well both in writing, direction, and performance.  Yes, it has the classic tarentino shock value but so much more.  Subtle humor, subtle horror, subtle redirection, this is The Film that made quentin tarantino a household name... not my absolute favorite, but close.  This is the film that made Samuel Jackson a legendary figure, revived John Travolta's career, and upgraded Uma Thurman to megastar status.  This is a wonderful vehicle for Bruce Willis.  I apologize if I've left anyone out.  But if you haven't seen it, you should.	5.0	one review?  one review?  how is this possible?	2013-01-10	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2D1H4HMCII3XM	Pat McCurry	If there is one thing that you must do, go out and get the widescreen version of Pulp Fiction. After seeing it, I come to the conclusion that all movies on video should be shown in this way. There is much more to see.  Vincent and Mia are shown talking in the car at the same time, as well as  dancing together. You can even see the reaction of all parties involved in  reviving Mia from her comatose state. The extra scenes at the end are a  nice payoff. As for the movie, I love it. All the performances are right on  track. Everyone gives 110% in their respective roles, especially Ving  Rhames (who's characters are always eclectic from Don King to Luther  Stickle). My favorite story, though, has to be &quot;The Gold Watch&quot;.  Willis is great as the &quot;palooka&quot; that runs into one mishap after  the other in an effort to get his watch. The soundtrack is also very  nostalgic with &quot;surf&quot; music and oldies but goodies. So go get  this widescreen version, enjoy it with a Big Kahuna Burger and a  &quot;tasty&quot; beverage. You won't be sorry (or maybe you will depending  on your tastes).	5.0	You feel that sting, BIG BOY?	2000-04-05	2	2	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3U4VUSBJMR5KP	Patrick A. Hayden	Before purchasing this special edition of Pulp Fiction, I had not seen the film since 1996.  I loved it back when it came out, and was waiting for a Special Edition to come out.  My patience was rewarded with the excellent two-disc set that includes not just a great transfer of the film, but a boatload of interesting features.Revisiting the movie, I was surprised at how fresh it still seems, how watchable it remains, how the characters are so well drawn and never fall into cliche.  The film is dilogue-driven, of course, as all of Tarantino's credited work has been.  Yes, there are some spectacular scenes of violence, but it's the scenes that rely on interaction between characters that are the most watchable.  The scene between Bruce Willis' Butch and the cab driver is facinating and provides deep looks into both personalities.  When Travolta and Sam Jackson, the hitmen, are talking before the apartment seen, the movie is all about the conversation and the people, with what they are about to do clearly not as important as who they are.  This dialogue style would be copied too many times in too many bad movies to count over the 90's, but here it still seems fresh.  The film is beautifully transferred on this disc, and remains a joy to watch.The extras are great, too.  Deleted scens with commentary by Tarantino are included, documentaries and interviews, and an old episode of Siskel and Ebert called &quot;The Tarantino Generation&quot; is on the disc as well, examining the immediate impact of the film on the cinema world.  It's a facinating time capsule that reflects how influential the film was, and continues to be.  This disc is a must own for any film fan.	5.0	Still Packs A Punch	2003-07-24	0	0	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2VF3BXFXXTEPL	Patrick Graham	"In Quentin Tarantino's critically acclaimed movie, Pulp Fiction, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and John Travolta do something to someone while trying to get some money for their boss.  They spend the movie carrying around a briefcase with something that lights up inside of it.  The combination to the briefcase is ""666"" and all the clocks in the movie are set at 4:20.There, I listed all of the things I know about Pulp Fiction.  I have watched the movie 5+ times and I still have absolutely no idea what is going on.  Everyone says they know what is in the briefcase (Samuel Jackson's soul) and because the combination to the briefcase is 666, that means he sold his soul to the devil.  Whatever the case may be, I just don't ""get"" this movie.  There are some very entertaining exchanges of dialogue between Jackson and Travolta and some great cinematography, but for the most part I have to say I am not a big fan of Pulp Ficton.  When I finish watching a movie, I don't like to turn to the person next to me and ask them what it was about.  Of course, on the flipside, maybe this is the brilliance of the movie.  Maybe we are not supposed to understand it, maybe we shouldn't have wasted our money on this DVD.I would at least watch this movie once just to be able to discuss it with other people, but I would borrow it from a friend.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2ODBHT4URXVXQ	"Peggy Vincent ""author and reader"""	"I know many people, mostly women, who refuse on principle to watch Pulp Fiction. ""It's too violent,"" they say, without even having seen it. And in several cases, these are the same women who love Carl Hiaasen's books. You want wacko violence? Read Hiaasen. Soooo, what's with not watching Pulp Fiction?Get over it. Watch it anyway. You won't regret it.For about  of the movie, you just have to take it on faith that the seemingly random bits of action are eventually going to merge and make some sense - and of course they do. The business of waiting, however, is NOT boring; a little confusing maybe, but definitely not boring. There are such spectacular, tongue-in-cheek bits of acting, violence, insanity, horror that you can't take your eyes off the screen. Right now, one particular one comes to mind (no, no, not the one with the brain matter splattered throughout the car's interior): Bruce Willis knows this bad dude is being tortured in a basement dungeon by some even badder guys, and sort of against his better judgment he decides he's gotta do something about it, even tho the guy being tortured has been determined to kill him (Willis). So he's in this store on the main floor, looking for a weapon - and meanwhile you hear the horrible sounds of the guy to whom terrible things are being done - and Willis is taking his sweet time, weighing a big gun against a mace against a pistol against a cudgel against a - - -  Aha! At last, just when you're ready to scream ""THE GUN, TAKE THE GUN"" at him, he finds what he's looking for: a samurai sword. And off he trots to save his would-be assassin.And what a cast. In addition to Willis, you've got Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Amanda Plummer, etc.Unbelievably terrific quirky wacko wild and wooly violent (yeah, it is violent) nutso twisted corrupt wicked hilarious top dog of a movie."	5.0	Watch it anyway	2004-07-29	18	14	4
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AZK2T7YZBLW7X	Penelope Lagrotta	Director Quentin Tarantino has for now 10 years been widly regarded as an over-night success for this, his breakthrough tale of irony and fate that effects the lives of a few distinct characters over a period of two days. Tarantino's puzzle-effect took this once 'Monster-Movie' script and morphed it's bold stories into 'Pulp Fiction'..A drama/Mystery Crime epic that made several actors synonymous with success; Bruce Willis, Samual L. Jackson, Uma Thurman and Ving Rhames. Lead by one of America's most beloved actors, John Travolta, this film uses it's audiences' imagination and memory to commit the convictions and events of the lives of these characters to their utmost importance. In a three part drama; a boxer (Bruce Willis) refuses to throw a championship fight, and in turn is pursued with vengeance by his manager (Ving Rhames). This manager's drug-addicted young wife (Uma Thurman) is trusted for that particular night, in the hands of his trusted hitman (John Travolta). This hitman is endulging in his day-to-day, job-to-bloody job career in a binding yet conflicting relationship with his partner (Samuel L. Jackson). This friendship/partnership to me subtly pays homage to the partnerships of buddy-cop triumphs of the past on screen, and it's power is broken wide open by a gripping character-realization by Jackson in the final scene. The circle of these characters, binded by completely separate conflicts, loops itself in this brilliant screenplay so as to make every action and recourse of one scene relevant to the next. I have for years admired not only the beautifully delivered performances by John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Ving Rhames in this film, but more so Tarantino's unique piecing-together of the movie's plots. 'Irony' is the only word I can relate to the feel of this movie, and despite it's graphic dialogue and violence, the direction and acting power has the ability to overshadow 'Pulp Fiction's rough edge, and effect even those who have never watched it. Films like 'Pulp Fiction' must be extremely difficult to make, and for Tarantino to use this method of direction and writing, is the overwhelming successful technique that makes it stand out among look-alikes.	5.0	A Possibly Redundant, Clear Look at This Cinametic A+	2004-01-29	3	1	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	ADE852UR9121C	perfecto	"Quentin Tarantino worked in a video rental shop before he started directing. Now, he makes movies that challenges the norm in Hollywood and hangs out with fellow ""kick-a$$"" director Robert Rodriguez. And of all his movies, I like Pulp Fiction the best. Yeah, his other work were also cool/stylistic/bad-a$$ (pick a word, they're all suitable) but this movie really blew me away with its unique storytelling, superb performances and witty dialogue.It's hard to explain the story, because it moves in and out of specific events, each interweaving with the next, either before or after the previous event. Confused? Watch it and you'll understand. But ultimately, it is a story about situations with various people, each interesting as hell. We have two hit men, a boxer and his girlfriend, the mob boss, his wife, two petty robbers and let's see...yeah, a guy who smart talks his way to cleaning messes (e.g. dead bodies). It may sound unusual but it all adds up to make a surprisingly entertaining movie.As I said, there are many things I loved about this movie, but something that really stands out is the screenplay. At the time, it was considered to be new and refreshing, and I can see why. Watching the movie more than 10 times, I realize something...this movie is not important, it probably does not depict real life and it's even incredibly crazy at times. It is also never going to affect me in any way. Well, what makes it special? I would call this cinematic escapism at it's finest. Many times, we find that the characters talk about totally different things than what we expect. But instead of sounding lame, Tarantino has a gift of knowing how far he should take it, and it ends up sounding cool and extremely unique. Tell me, how many people can pull of talking about burgers in Amsterdam sound cool and intelligent...and as insane as that sounds, Tarantino does it. The thing you notice immediately is the passion involved in the movie. You know you're getting whatever the f*ck Tarantino wishes to put into it, without pesky studio bosses, or marketing executives telling him otherwise. It's a huge gamble, but it works.A good script is integral, but what really sells the movie is the actors...and the fact that Tarantino got a whole bunch of talented people to appear in Pulp Fiction, speaks for itself. John Travolta delivers one of his best performances, launching back his career to an all-time high. Samuel L. Jackson is also superb in his role. The rest of the cast; Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel...all give very convincing performances that the movie comes alive and I guess making it so much more than what it set out to be.Finally, if you look at Top 100 Lists anywhere, on the net, in cinema books...you are bound to find this movie somewhere there, and believe me... it very well deserves to be. Considered historic in American cinema, I for one, recommend it wholeheartedly."	5.0	One of a kind...	2005-07-20	4	3	1
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1QWG77KXFU4GI	Perrin Frch	"Pulp Fiction is Quentin Tarantino's perfect masterpiece, and is one of the most influential films of all time. Winner of The best picture award(Palm d'Or) at the competitive Cannes Film Festival, this film sparked off a whole lot of contreversy regarding the film's violence and drug use. Pulp Fiction has lovers and haters, you either love Pulp Fiction or you hate it. The film also garnerd alot of awards, including: Best Picture at the Independant Spirit Awards, as well as plenty of other wins, and best original screenplay at the Oscars. It also got nominated for six other awards at the oscars, including best picture, but lost out to Forrest Gump. The movie changed the way we tell stories and sparked off the 'Quentin Tarantino generation'. The film influenced such films as: City Of God, Amores Perros, and Memento. The reason why it influenced these, is for the seperate stories and the chronological orders of the films, like Memento is told backwards. Tarantino is also a huge influence on Sin City director Robert Rodriguez, and worked together on many projects.Pulp Fiction is a jumbled up story, the film's stories aren't shown in chronilogical order, but all the stories in the film are all interwined. The film has no main character, but instead, some stories have a central character. The opening sequence of the film has the bandit lovers pumpkin, and honey bunny(played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) sitting in a coffee shop talking about what they do. Tim Roth's character is talking about how dangerous their jobs are getting and what their next hold up is going to be. He starts saying that it's a tough job, because some of the shop owners don't understand a word they say, and some places are armed to the teeth for them. These people aren't killers, they don't kill, but want to get a big hold up. He eventually suggests they should hold up restaurants, because no body expects it. They come down to an agreement, pull out their guns and hold up the place, and then the credits kick in. The stories include: ""Vincent Vega & Marsellus Wallace's Wife"", the central character here is Vincent Vega(John Travolta), who is a highly skilled hitman. He has been asked by his boss, who is a big crime boss, Marsellus Wallace to look after his wife, take her out for a good time, and make sure she doesn't get into trouble while he's gone. Everyone asumes that he's taking her on a date but he assures them that it's like taking a friends wife to the movies. The lady is Mia Wallace(played by Uma Thurman), he takes her to place she wants to go to called ""Jack Rabbit Slim's"", and is a 50s pop culture restaurant with everything that is 1950's. This features the very famous scene where Mia and Vincent do the twist dance for the dancing competition on stage, and also has the infamous, and intense OD(over dose) scene where they have to race time to get her a shot. The second story is titled ""The Gold Watch"", where the central character is Butch Coolidge. His story starts off with a him, as a young boy, watching TV. He is suddenly interrupted by his mother, and tells him that there's a man to see him. The man(a cameo by Christopher Walken) is a friend of his father's, who died in a POW camp in Vietnam. The man tells Butch a story of a gold watch that his father kept for him. After he takes the watch from the man's hand a bell clings, we then realise Butch is having a dream and is going to fight in an important boxing match. Earlier in the film, Mr. Wallace is paying Butch and telling him that he's to dive in the fourth round. He kills the boxer(without knowing) and wins the fight. He makes a run for it and knows that Wallace will kill him if he finds him. Butch has planned ahead, with his girlfriend supporting him, he has got to pick up alot of money he won due to the fight, and go get his watch that his girlfriend left behind at their old place. Knowing that it's dangerous to go back, he still can't leave his most treasured posession behind, this story follows what it took for him to get his watch back. The final story is ""The Bonnie Situation"", and it's central character is Jules Winnfield, Vincent's fellow hitman. This story follows a hit gone wrong, when they had to go get payback for what these young kids did to Marseluss, they get the briefcase they came for with a trail of bodies left behind. Vincent accidently kills the guy who led them to the kids and then have to get the car off the road quickly. They then get to a friend's place whom the hitmen need his help desperately. They've got to clean the car filled with blood and a dead body out, before Jimmie's(the helper) wife Bonnie gets back from the graveyard shift at the hospital.The film's biggest highlight is the dialogue, Tarentino, and Roger Avary's script is one of the most perfectly balanced screenplays you can get. It has everything a good crime film must have, suspense, humour, violence, and snappy dialogue. The writing for the characters are just masterfully done, they talk like normal people would talk like on the way to work, or sitting at a restaurant, meanwhile they're crooks who, we see, are just doing another day's job. The acting is also outstanding, with Tarantino's direction that bought out the very best the cast could give us. The soundtrack is fantastic and makes the film the even more enjoyable.Overall, the film is the perfection that every movie buff dreams of, and can't go wrong at any point. If you don't like Tarantino's work, then you probably won't get this. But, for everybody else, it's unmissible.The extra features are brilliant on this disc. We have deleted scenes with a build-up for each scene by QT, the acceptance speach QT gave when they won the Palm d'Or, the full interview with QT on the Charlie Rose Show(very interesting), The trailers from all around the world as well as TV spots, a gallery with promotional stuff, reviews and articles, a making of montage for the jack rabbit slim's scene and theButch car crash scene, the full special that was shown on the Siskel & Ebert show, that had the special on Tarantino's influence on other filmmakers and the world, a very interesting option where you watch the film with subtitles about interesting facts about the film, and the Independent Spirit Awards interviews. The extras have everything the ultimate Pulp Fiction fan wants, and should definately be watched. A must-have. The film: 5/5, The extras: 5/5"	5.0	Essential Tarantino.	2006-08-05	4	2	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A105AO5C0KHXKV	Peter A. Kafka	The movie is as great as ever (though its asethetic has been so thorougly integrated in mainstream culture that much of what was amazing when the film originally appeared is now less impressive). But either the director or Miramax (or both) are doing a disservice to the film's fans with this release. Aside from some fancy (but still uninteresting) packaging, there's little here besides the film itself - the musty &quot;documentary&quot; footage is run-of-the-mill infotainment, there are only a handful of extra scenes, and there is no audio commentary at all. Tellingly, the extra scenes are introduced by archival footage of Tarantino that's likely seven or eight years old, given that he references what other filmmakers do with the &quot;laserdisc&quot; versions of their movies. Given that Tarantino hasn't made a movie in five years, you'd assume that he would have time to jam this special edition with bells and whistles. Since he hasn't, you're better off buying the bare-bones version for half the price.	3.0	overpriced, overhyped	2002-08-16	41	28	13
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A343DKR8HKOE0K	Peter	If you want special editions, it's usually a given that you should try the DVD version instead of the VHS movie.  Most &quot;Special Editions&quot; contain small clips that don't reveal much in the regards to the director's intentions.Although Pulp Fiction's Special Edition does contain only a small clip, it's a better job than most VHS movies manage.  Quentin Tarantino narrates the clip following the movie and shares with the audience his feelings (and shows the previously edited scenes) as to why certain segments were taken out.  A unique perspective on an original Hollywood mind.As for Pulp Fiction itself - let me tell you that I am one who shies away from onscreen violence in that I feel most violent scenes are gratuitious displays taking advantage of modern day special effects and audience appeal.  ALL of Tarantino's films contain LARGE amounts of violence, but for lack of a better way to explain it, the guy keeps you glued on his scenes.  EXCELLENT writing; stories out of a vivid imagination and with character complexities that most modern day movies lack.Tarantino has a style that is all his own and I would recommend that you watch this or any Tarantino picture.  A great treat with most Tarantino films is that he casts actors &amp; actresses that give acting its grandeur.  This film follows in the same tradition with GREAT performances by Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, Jon Travolta, Uma Thurman, Christoper Walken, etc..  Pulp Fiction has a great cast to act one of the few modern day movies that has a screenplay that stands out above the movie itself.	5.0	A GREAT PIECE OF CINEMA &amp; SURPRISINGLY GOOD SPECIAL EDITION	2001-01-06	0	0	0

Why I am not sure since most films that are shot in or take place in Los Angeles I usually enjoy very much.  I thought the part towards the end with Harvey Keitel in it was great, yet some of the drug scenes were just not interesting.  This movie reminds me of so many other films that are based out of LA like 'crash, from 2005', '2 days in the valley', in how the movie was developed and plays out.  Must be the atmosphere that Los Angeles brings to the movie making process and that it is the nicest place I have ever been to in this country.  Overall, the film is very popular and has a great cast to it.  Maybe a little less drugs for me and I would give it 5 stars.Peter J.

Tarantino should be proud that he went from working as a cashier at Blockbuster video to a successful 90's flash in the pan director. Frankly I think he should still be working at Blockbuster. His success is classic proof that anyone can make it if they try hard enough. Original or not, good cast or not, this is just another violent bloodbath full of torture and rape. Hardly an excuse for entertainment. And as for his attempt at making it funny, comedy should be left to comedians. The biggest shame of all is that this film inspired so many rip-offs which were even worse. If Tarantino wants to direct and be in front of the camera, why doesn't he make another Revenge of the Nerds movie? He'd finally be perfectly cast and maybe then there might be a reason to laugh.	1.0	Absolute Garbage!	2001-07-03	36	9	27

Ready to buy the movie yet?If not, you've obviously never heard of him or seen any of his works.  Writer, director and amateur actor, he melds colour, music and  video into one.  The Pulp Fiction soundtrack is quite terrible to anyone  who hasn't seen the movie, but after you have, each tune reminds you of a  scene from the movie - from Travolta trippin' in his car to the (hilarious)  rape scene, where Bruce Willis saves himself and his arch-enemy from  shot-gun weilding hicks.  The twisting, multi-protagonistic plot is  excellent and enjoyable for layman and intellectual alike.This is my  favorite movie from the last 10 years (a close second to Apocalypse Now),  buy it now and enjoy it for years.	5.0	BRING OUT THE GIMP	2000-05-15	2	1	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	Pulp Fiction was a groundbreaking film in a couple of different ways.  It was an independent release and its success opened the door up for all kinds of maverick filmmakers and companies to release films that otherwise would have never been made.  It also had a profound stylistic influence.  It was a hip movie with sharp dialogue, graphic violence, cool soundtrack and intricate plotlines.  In the wake of its success, many movies try to copy this style, but most failed as they lacked Quentin Tarantino's unique vision.  Mr. Tarantino was able to pull John Travolta out of a decade long funk and directed him to the finest performance of his career and one that garnered his second Academy Award nomination.  He also pushed Bruce Willis to a stellar performance that showed he was more than just an action hero. The cast is first rate including a beguiling Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Eric Stolz,  Rosanna Arquette and Christopher Walken.  The best performance of all is given by Samuel L. Jackson who is absolutely amazing.  It was a crime that he did not win the Academy Award for the role.  Pulp Fiction is broken up into three parts and includes flashbacks, flash-forwards and twists and turns and some mysteries that are never revealed.  It is a rare film that is both stylish and full of substance.	5.0	Tarantino's Best	2001-12-04	19	13	6

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AVLZVV431RS2G	poptartassasin06	Ah Pulp Fiction. Hands down Quentin Tarantino's most popular movie (not saying his best that's up to the viewer to decide). Being a great fan of all of Quentin's movies this is definitely no exception. What made this movie so great? Was it the large amount of colorful characters who played top notch in their environments and situations they found themselves in? Was it the unforgetable and slick dialogue? Was it breaking the trait of showing a movie in chronological order and mixing the movie up? Was it the excellent selection of music? Or was it all of them combined. That would be my guess. Pulp Fiction arose in 1994 and is still recognized as one of the better films of the 90's. It has tried to be replicated time and time again but no film could ever reach the quality Pulp Fiction provided. Upon multiple viewings I still find myself enamored with this film and I doubt my love for it will ever grow thin. Love it or hate it Pulp Fiction is not one you'll find yourself quickly forgeting.	5.0	Pulp Fiction	2004-01-17	2	0	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1TPW86OHXTXFC	"prisrob ""pris,"""	I had the opportunity to watch 'Pulp Fiction' the other day with friends. It was as funny and violent as I remembered. After all it is a film about blood and gore, sex, rock n' roll, drugs and pretty fancy clothing.This may be John Travolta's best role. He is an actor I dislike intensely, but in this role I could overlook that. He is Vincent Vega, a hit man who works for the mob. The more messes he gets into, the worse they become. We see him with his partner, Jules, played by Samuel L. Jackson, on their way to visit drug dealers, and are discussing the French word for Quarter Pounders. Sounds pretty innocent, does it not?Travolta is asked by his boss, Ving Rhames to take his wife, played by Uma Thurman,out for a night. Travolta turns up stoned, and can barely talk.  They go to Jack Rabbit Slim's, a 50's theme restaurant. Thurman overdoses and a mess develops.Around every other corner is another mess to be cleaned iPhone. The action is violent, the conversations hilarious, and the writing if this film one if the best. Of course, the director, Quentin Tarantino is superb, and really he cannot outdo himself with another film.We laughed and cringed our way through this film, and I thought, this needs to be seen on a regular basis!Highly Recommended. prisrob 04-27-14	5.0	A Royale With Cheese	2014-04-27	1	1	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ	Private Quentin Tarantino Fan	"Roger Ebert once quoted on At the Movies (the episode covering Pulp Fiction is included on here) that Quentin Tarantino is the first movie director to be called a rock and roll star.  That's entirely true.  I really have never felt this passionate about a movie before, as well as Quentin Tarantino himself.  I will, and have, go to some lengths to defend.  Whether or not  Tarantino does or does not care about his fans, well, maybe he should tone down his quality in his movies if he doesn't want my exuberant praise (but I'll bet you anything he'll enjoy that notion).  It's your own fault, Tarantino!  While his other masterpiece, Reservoir Dogs is a bit more concise (and features monologues that are possibly better), Pulp Fiction is wild, never lets up, a bit more original (even though I don't like City on Fire, you got to give it credit for being a plot line).  And I love it! Not bad for a movie I thought would just be something I watch once then forget about it.Sure, Pulp Fiction sadly sometimes becomes the whipping boy of self-righetous, _________ film ________ who think they know everything (stupid ________), but those who love this movie know the other people are just too unfortunate to realize what an incredible movie this is.  Pulp Fiction, while not heavily stylized artistically (as in art direction), is first off, set in an arguably wonderland of crime-ridden LA.  That's all it needs to do, because Pulp Fiction takes no time in immersing you in the crime ridden world of Pulp Fiction.  As one critic noted (hey, I don't like critics but have no problem with the praise it gets), it's like entering a rabbit hole into LA, even moreso.  Your there in Jack Rabbit Slim's, chilling with Mia and Vincent, feeling the 50's ""wax museum with a pulse"". When Butch and Marsellus are being held captive by two really perverted dudes, your feeling (which is pretty wrong, props to Butch in the end) it with them (not exactly a good feeling, unless it's your fantasy or something.  Yeck).  You fall in love with your surroundings and the characters, not something that comes naturally for some movies.Some film buffs say that Tarantino's directing skills are a smorgasbord of ""copied"" camera techniques (like  even though this or this may not be true (but I really don't give a ______), I don't think the movie would be the same without them.  Besides, I've said before that Tarantino isn't the style master (David Fincher, Darren Afronsky, Tim Burton, and David Lynch for starters outwit him), but I still don't think there's single ordinary use of camera (well, maybe not).  His wide array of close up shots, tracking shots, and his knack for making facial expressions add to the characters believabiltiy really show that Tarantino knows how to direct.  Besides, True Romance and From Dusk Till Dawn show (Natural Born Killers was his, but Oliver Stone did a lot to it, it probably did not even look like a Tarantino movie anymore) that Tarantino's scripts ebenfit when he directs them himself.  His vision comes to full force when he's behind the camera.The ensemble cast is one of my favorite and most memorable.  Admittaley, I'm not surprised that each Thurman, Jackson, and Travolta were just nominated.  I didn't like Forest Gump but I feel that Tom Hanks was more accomplished, Uma Thurman wasn't quite the best, and Jackson faced tough competition from Martin Laundua from Ed Wood (another great performance from a great movie from that year).  However, although Travolta and Jackson did not win giving the competition, the all star cast is still one for the ages.  John Travolta's sagging career got a great revival with his best role to date, and Thurman's classiness makes for a believable Mia Wallace.  Samuel L Jackson's performance as Jules is also his most memorable ever, his sheer bad@$$ery, along with some of eh most quotable lines, makes him one of the most imitated and well-loved characters in the Tarantino canon.  As a matter of fact, there's no dull moment with Jackson.  But that's not all, either!  Christopher Walken's spot on portrayal as a veteran is significant despite his low screen time, and Bruce Willis's cementation as a bad @$$ mother_______ (no doubt from movies like Die Hard) rocks as well.  The rest of the cast rule, from Tim Roth (finally dropping the annoying fake American accent),  Amanda Plummer, Harvey Kietel, Rosanna Arquette, and the paranoid stoner portrayed by Eric Stoltz.  Lance is particulary well portrayed.  He's so paranoid and his exaggerated actions (watching him freak out after Vince crahses into his house is hilarious) Heck, even Tarantino's character, Jimmy, is funny.  Tarantino's isnt' the greatest actor (he was really annoying in Death Proof), but he's not half as bad as some people make him out to be.The crowning jewel of Pulp Fiction is, of course, the dialogue.  _________ Coen Brothers (the single most overrated film-makers on the planet) wish they could write dialogue as good as this (Fargo?  Oh please), or dialogue that's even remotely entertaining.  While his other movies are worthy of mention, none of them is jam packed with this much dialogue.  While admittaley, some of the lines are not exactly super-cool one lienrs in the vein of such lines as ""Rosebud"", ""I'm gonna Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse"" or ""You Talkin' To Me?"", it transcends the one-liner notion.  Pulp FIction is the kind of movie where you quote whole bits of dialogue, with hardly any filler, and paying much attention to detail.  The characters themselves each talk in their own distinctive way, something that Roger Ebert himself noted.  Oh, and I've never as much fun swearing in my life in a Tarantino movie (because, I of course, talk along with the dialogue).Oh, and it probably has one of the best compilation soundtracks I've ever heard, but you probably already know that.  The soundtrack is used in the best way possible, and the movie itself doesn't benefit for a score, silence falls when needed, and the right music captures the right mood of the movie perfectly, whatever mood it's in.  Some of the dances are iconic, as well as the instant classic twist scene, as you all know of.  But many moments are highlighted and burned into your mind with the music tracks. From the theme of Misirlou and Jungle Boogie, Son of A Preacher Man, and the extensive use of Surf Rider at the end of the movie, these songs gain meaning when used in the movie (as well as any Tarantino movie), and add a hell of a lot to it.  The soundtrack proves that music beyond traditional film scores can, and do, highlight and create the exact same thing that traditinal film scores do so well.  It's not just meaning to be witty, it's just Tarantino's way of using music and what he chooses.  No wonder Paul Thomas Anderson creates so many scenes with popular music (I think they have a healthy rivarly, regarding the two).There are some petty criticisms for me, as the movie does fall a bit in the Gold Watch Segment,(especially during the pointless sex scene between Butch and Fabianne), but come on, the criticism were in one ________ sentence!  The two disc set is amazingly good, with a bevy of features and interesting articles (Roger Ebert especially).  It's all you wanted to know about such a well-made, fun movie.But anyway, Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece, and what I mean by masterpiece is it's done by a master, in a masterful way, and I _________ mean that _______________!  Needless to say, Pulp Fiction deserves to be much higher than in the 90's on AFI's list of the 100 greatest movies, among the other established ""classics"" on that list.  That, and even higher in the IMDB list (Only 5?  Come On!).A"	5.0	"""*Insert Whole Script Here*"".  I'm Not Kidding"	2009-05-25	1	1	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3B1XRW9HIGYQB	P. Woods	What can I say? A breahtaking film by a hungry director &quot;Quentin Tarantino&quot;. Quentin first introduced us to his debut &quot;Reservoir dogs&quot;, all about a foiled jewel robbery. Well, this film is quite similar, only in the form of the characters. The characters in &quot;Pulp fiction&quot; are amazing. From two hitmen, to a crime lord's wife, to a man who solves problems, to a robber, to the robber's girlfriend, to boxer's wife, to the crime lord, to a drug seller, to the drug seller's wife, to a war hero, to the boxer, to a gimp and to a briefcase. All these characters are involved in one of three stories. The film is split in to three stories, but they're all jumbled up. So, I'll tell you about them in the order you see them:Story 1: Vincent Vega (John Travolta) has to take a crime lord's wife out for a meal, but while he does, she takes a sniff of cocaine, causing her to go into ecstacy. Vincent then haas to take her to get help, before the crime lord finds out about it. My 2nd favourite story. Includes the famous &quot;dancing scene&quot; with Uma and John on the stage.Story 2: Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is a boxer, who has to lose this fight to a guy, once he does that he'll be able to walk away with a pile of money. But Butch actually doesn't lose the fight, he wins it and steals the money. Now the chase is on. But it gets worse, when Butch accidentally leaves his father's watch in his motel room, he has to go back and get it. But he gets spotted by the gangsters, and the rest of the story gets mad. My least favourite story, but it's still good.Story 3: When Vincent Vega accidentally blows this guy's head off in the backseat of a car. He and his partner Jules (Samuel L Jackson) have to try and figure out what to do before anyone finds out. They use the help of Winston Wolf (Harvey Keitel) to sort everything out. The best story, funny, amusing and has a great climax.Film seem strange? Nah, it's highly enjoyable. So, if you're just a casual fan of films get this! You'll love it.	5.0	This is what made the 90s famous.	2004-05-31	6	1	5

Either way, it's a very good representation of what so many people crave for, the liberation of their oppressed inner being (typical human being), holding complete and meticulous domination over themselves and whoever is in the proximities as well.The humor content is very subtle and well thought out...you actually have to think about what puchlines are spread throughout the movie, such as Jules's wrath at having to pick up brain instead of Vinces, or the constant reminder of how good Jimmy's coffee is.I think the movie has a few flaws, which cost it the 5th star...I found the part that portraits Bruce Willis in the cab and at the motel rather bland and lacking momentum...Perhaps there are a few exaggerations throughout, such as trying to believe that the guy in the diner (Pumpkin, I guess is his name) actually was taught a lesson by what Jules had to say about the shepherd and stuff..I'm pretty sure that if I had a gun at point-blank range from my cranium my sole concern would be the movements of Jules's second finger..but that's just me...	4.0	Subtle stuff...	2001-09-07	2	0	2

Yes, John Travolta and Samuel Jackson do marvelous jobs, which is especially interesting for Travolta as his early entry into being ""bad"" (his later entries were less convincing). Not to meantion Bruce Willis doing a smaller part that is also a bit of a departure for him -- a bad guy that wimps out but does the ""right thing"" (well, sorta). You get to see all sides -- cold-blooded business man, compassionate, woman-lover, deserter-turned-loyalist, sucker. The editing and sound are excellent (I also bought the soundtrack, but it includes too much dialog to be really enjoyable). I am always torn between ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" for the best in the genre. They are different just enough to almost be in separate categories, but if you like mobster like films, go with ""Reservoir Dogs"" and if you like more dark-side-of-high-society, go with ""Pulp Fiction""."	5.0	Royale with Cheese	2003-01-29	6	2	4

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AFXCK9RDV4ZQ2	Ravenlore	One thing is for sure, this film certainly knows how to offend the right  people -- And that's why it's so great. Quentin Tarantino's PULP FICTION is  a rare masterpiece that is unlikely to be repeated by him, or his  imitators. And believe me, many have tried, with varying levels of success.  Tarantino pulls out all of the stops with Pulp Fiction -- stupendous  dialogue, discourses on the meaning of life, flash-backs, weird camera  angles, brutal torture and fascinating people. These extended sequences of  talking are like a trademark, providing insights into the characters and  lulls between the bouts of frenetic violence, which occur in everything  that this director touches. However, true to the theme of pulp magazines,  these linked stories have no connection with reality and the actors,  realising this, play their parts with gusto. It seems churlish to pick  Travolta and Jackson as the stars, since everyone is convincing in their  portrayals, but these two are great foils to each other and provide an  intriguing core to the movie. Combined with a superb soundtrack, which both  fits into the action and provides a setting for it, the effect is akin to a  154-minute roller-coaster ride; exhilarating but exhausting. Now I'm  certain that everyone reading this review has seen Pulp Fiction but that  doesn't matter. See it again. Now.	5.0	Dead Nigger Storage	2000-08-20	5	3	2

The DVD was disappointing. Almost no extras whatsoever. It was basically the movie divided into chapters. The sound quality was good , but could have been better - especially given the great soundtrack. The picture quality is great but in widescreen format so you need a big screen TV to really get the full benefit off this. The DVD did not allow the viewer to specify the viewing format. Oddly enough the Canadian version of this DVD(same encoding as USA- region 1) has some extras. This version has a few deleted scenes, each one introduced by Quentin Tarantino. there are also trailers from different countries. Fans of the movie who want to add it to their collection would be better off with this - you may find it at an auction site. It gets 4 stars for being a great movie. if this was not such good movie this DVD would only get 3 stars.	4.0	great movie - diapointing DVD	2000-12-03	11	8	3
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A15P8SPI39DNMM	"Raymond A. Mardo ""raymardo"""	Quentin Tarantino delivers the goods in tall order, along with with one of the most talented casts ever assembled and a brilliant story.This is a movie that requires full undivided attention from the viewer from beginning to end. It is a complex weave of smaller stories that are told in a non linear fashion which actually makes for a better story then if they were laid out in thier natural order. Presenting them out of sequence affords us some brilliant directing by Tarantino - who also provides some good laughs, and proves that he's a capable actor alogside these heavyweights, in his portrayal of Jimmy from Toluca Lake - and allows the award winning director to end the movie at a more interesting spot in the natural timeline.This movie literally grabs you from the beginning. Even the opening credits, which occur after the first scene, hold your interest, and they are simply words over a black screen, set to music.To enjoy Pulp Fiction: turn the phone off; pause if you go to the bathroom; don't talk during the movie, and prepare a snack beforehand; it's a little over three hours long.I've noticed that anyone that has said that this movie didn't make sense, or that they didn't like it, didn't watch the whole thing. They missed entire sequences by talking or leaving the room. Every part of this movie is necessary to tell it's stroy.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A194GQYVY9HXUP	Ray-Review	"Quentin Tarantino is one of the most unconventional film directors of our lifetime, and I am quite a big fan of his. The first of his films I have ever experienced by Tarantino was Kill Bill, and I loved those 2 films and have watched them numerous times. Tarantino likes to mix up different genres that don't usually coincide with one another, however he finds a way to execute seamlessly in all of his films. Pulp Fiction is Tarantinos masterpiece of cinema, being able to tell a compelling story without following a linear storyline, or even a cohesive story for that matter. What ""Pulp Fiction"" accomplishes that I have never seen in any other movies is rely totally on the characters personas instead of focusing on the story's plot. That may sound weird but let me elaborate; the plot's story to be honest is not entirely interesting in my personal opinion, it essentially revolves around a crime lord (Ving Rhames) with a wife (Uma Thurman), two gangsters who work for the crime lord (John Travolta) and (Samuel L. Jackson) and a boxer (Bruce Willis).  Now all of these characters are interconnected in the film in one way or another, however not all of the characters are relevant towards each other than the fact that (Ving Rhames character) Marsellus Wallace is the central word of mouth in the storyline.I am not going to ruin the story for those who have not watched the film yet, but I will say that if you are new to Tarantino's style of filmmaking, or just a casual movie goer, I guarantee you will be polarized after the first viewing of this movie. Not everyone I know likes this film, as a matter of fact only a hand few appreciate the film as I do, but the main complaint about the film that I always hear is that ""there is too much talking..."" well yes this film is abundant of dialogue, but that's pretty much the appeal of the film. When I watched this film for the first time, the impression that I had was that the director just let the actors have irrelevant conversations with one another until until he yelled cut, because to be perfectly honest, a lot of the characters conversations are just utter nonsense that you would actually hear in real life. And that's where I found the film so compelling; I felt that these kind of situations and conversations (although some are more plausible than others) could very well happen in our own world. There is nothing in this film that seemed farfetched and that's what grabbed me and had me re-watching this movie numerous times after. The acting was so well done that it just felt natural for the viewers.The standout performance for me would easily have to be Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield. I would say in my humble opinion that at least 80% of Samuel's dialogues are memorable quotable's. And that goes the same for John Travolta and Uma Thurman, but this is by far my favorite performance from Samuel L. Jackson in any of his roles. And I have to tip my hat to Tarantino, his writing in this film couldn't be any more original and endearing. I can't forget about the films soundtrack either, his choice of music was so diverse that I found myself shocked and impress of how well these songs fit the scenes. Now I am by no means a film expert, but I would have to say that this film is truly one of a kind, and I dare anybody to say otherwise. If you don't like this film, than I can understand, Pulp Fiction is not for everybody, especially not for people who just like action explosions and fart jokes. From the incoherant beginning to the amazingly well-written climax, the fun of the film is to just sit back and just enjoy the characters and piece together the storyline. This is an amazing movie, nuff said."	5.0	There's Nothing Like It	2012-12-07	0	0	0

But little did I know that I'd be walking around now, able to quote long sections of the script, most notably the wild gesticulations of Samuel Jackson as Jules, partner in the shakedown trade with Vincent Vega, played by John Travolta in what has to be the only decent film he's made since the glory days of ""Grease"" and ""Saturday Night Fever"".  I do recommend that you get the unedited, full ""R"" version, for the language is meant to be heard just as it was put on Tarantino's palette and dished forth, ""bloody as hell"", but ""yummy"" as ""a $5.00 shake"".  It took a few viewings to get the sequence all figured out, but now I rattle it forth from the heap of videos every few months, to appreciate like an artwork you keep seeing in new ways.  I would like it now to have the DVD widescreen of the whole thing, for I'm sure there are happenings in the two ends of the pan-and-scan that I'd enjoy seeing, now that I'm fully integrated into the ""Pulp Fiction"" cult.  Our creative writing teacher in high school said that good results are obtained by placing ""words in strange places"".  In the Tarantino's case, whole sequences that are developed, to just the right length, and put in some mighty strange places indeed."	5.0	The cornerstone of any decent film collection	2004-09-14	3	1	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2WL02ENWFU9PM	Rex Macaroe	"Pulp Fiction opens in an ordinary diner, cutting into the middle of some coffee talk between a man and woman. The dialog reveals that the two are lovers who make a living robbing liquor stores. Their demeanor portrays two young individuals who steal because it's interesting, an occupation from which movies are made, but there's a problem: liquor stores are more trouble than they're worth. The risk is too high, the rewards to little. They need something new, so they decide to rob the coffee shop. What's more, it's first suggested in full presence of their waitress. She doesn't care as long as they don't call her ""garcon.""I remember seeing this scene for the first time in eighth grade, how I found myself captivated by how casual the conversation was and how the characters seemed to enjoy how casually they could discuss the robbery in full view of the waitress. I remember my thrill at the way each cut or zoom seemed to perfectly compliment the nature of the scene at any given moment. I didn't realize it at the time, but this was a turning point in my life. For the first time in my life, I was appreciating art.Pulp Fiction has since become my favorite film, and for the personal significance it has to me, I predict it will stay my favorite.As you probably already know, ""it follows three interlocking stories centered on two hitmen."" You've probably heard about Tarantino's trademark dialog and use of music, his nonlinear narrative structure. You might not know that this is a story about decisions and consequences, damnation and redemtion, all along delighting in the eccentricities of human behavior.The prose dialog is at times poetic in its lack of poetic flavor. Take for instance the scene directly following Marvin's untimely having-his-head-blown-off. The blood-soaked Jules and Vincent wash the blood off their hands. Jules criticizes Vincent for doing a half-*ssed job of it, even staining someone else's towel. The characters don't see the symbolism in the act clensing blood-stained hands; they're just washing up. The dialog and performance treats it as such. The same thing happens several minutes later when the two are naked in the back yard, waiting to be hosed down. ""Is this absolutely necessary?"" Vincent complains, while Jules is more concerned about getting the pieces of brain and skull out of his jheri-curls.These scenes are amusing even without reading into them because we see a reflection of our own behavior placed in extreme circumstances. The script is profound without seeming profound. It has the courage to just run with it, burying the secrets of life in conversation about hamburgers and ""fi' dolla shakes.""More weight is added to these scenes by the fact that we already know Vincent is going to die very soon because we see it happen about halfway through the film. Many films feature nonlinear structure for the sake of seeming stylistic (or because the writers are ripping off Tarantino), but here the structure actually strengthens the movement of the story. Armed with knowledge of future events, we see how they would come to pass. How characters remain blindsighted in the face of miracles, while others feel the touch of God and sense the need to change.Those of you who remain reluctant to see this film, because it seems like little more than gratuitus violence should see it right away. It's a brilliant drama based on growth of characters and very human emotions. Just because Tarantino won't stop yammering on late-night talk shows doesn't make him any less genius."	5.0	Thematic symbolism lurks just beneath the surface of behavior and violence in the greatest film ever made	2005-08-19	4	1	3

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3UF6OQ3CLCD3S	"R. McNally ""Author, 'CLASS DISMISSED: 75 Outr..."	"In ""Pulp Fiction,"" director Quentin Tarantino consistently defies viewer expectation and delivers one of the best films of the '90s. You'll marvel at Tarantino's adept bending of time structure, brilliant dialogue and memorable images. Some indie fans may prefer the admittedly great ""Reservoir Dogs,"" but I say no go: ""Pulp Fiction"" is a deeper, more audacious and more accomplished picture.Plot synopsis is difficult when dealing with Tarantino's time-bending narrative, but here goes: ""Pulp Fiction"" commences with two hitmen -- Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) -- slinging hilarious dialogue (already considered classic) as they journey to collect some product from a soon-to-be former employee. After taking care of business, Travolta takes out his boss's lovely wife (Uma Thurman) as a favor to his out-of-town employer. A seemingly innocent night out turns into a unforgettable evening of '50s nostalgia, drug overdose and a memorable needle scene that will have the more squeamish population wincing.The next sequence involves Bruce Willis as a boxer who agrees to throw a bout at the behest of Vincent's boss (Ving Rhames), but then has second thoughts. The situation gets considerably hairier when Willis and Rhames unexpectedly come face-to-face following the bout, and then must eventually join forces due to the most unforeseen of circumstances.The movie does have its slow spots, most notably a dull sequence when a death-obsessed female cab driver peppers Willis with a series of bizarre questions. The scene isn't particularly funny, and in a 3-hour film it's clearly superfluous. That said, complaining about a single scene seems like sour grapes when discussing a masterpiece like Pulp Fiction. The film is consistently hilarious and pushes the envelope in just about every sense.An oft-overlooked plot point is Jules' life-changing realization in the film's final act, a transformation that makes the movie about something instead of just a stylish piece of entertainment. Jackson's phenomenal performance is the best of many excellent acting turns, most notably John Travolta's outstanding comeback role, Uma Thurman's career-best peformane and Ving Rhames' star-making turn. Even the perpetually obnoxious Eric Stoltz is hilarious.Andrzej Sekula's brilliant cinematography demands mention, making great scenes even greater (e.g. Travolta's walk down drug-trip lane). ""Pulp Fiction"" is a stunning film that deservedly cements Tarantino's position as one of the industry's hottest directors."	5.0	"""There is no me and you. Not no more..."""	2007-05-21	4	2	2
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A8EMYIOE9SVR5	"""robbyk"""	Wow what a rush! That's the only way to describe this Tarantino masterpiece (speaking of him, where did he go?). You know you're a respected director when u can release an independent film packed with world-renowned stars who will do anything to be in your movie. The structure, plot twists, script, and acting are all unique: Tarantino does an excellent job in taking all of his talents and letting them go on the screen. And Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson (who gives his most commanding performance; his presence alone frightens you), and Thurman along with each other cast member gives Tarantino all that he needs to work his extraordinary script.Although this film is not for the faint-hearted, you'll feel like you've taken part in something extremely special after watching it.

Not this one!!!This two-disc set packs lots of goodies, including castinterviews, location footage, stunts, and a BUNCH ofdeleted scenes, narrated by the drector. Also, a neat box, booklet & a Jackrabbit Slim's menu.  Quentin Tarantino knows a good story, as seen in his first film, Reservoir Dogs. In Pulp Fiction, three stories intertwine: two has-been gangsters, played beautifully by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, try to deliver a mystic parcel to their boss, Marcellis Wallis (Ving Rhames). Meanwhile, has-been boxer Butch (Bruce Willis), runs afoul of (and runs over!) his boss,also Mr. Wallis. The trio of stories is rounded out with the adventures of Travolta and the boss's sassy wife,Mia.Far from a 'family' film, Pulp Fiction tkes on a lot of social taboos, gets downright philosophical, and maintains a dialogue that manages to be funny, in the midst of the violence, drugs and just plain weirdness...Memorable scene: Jules Winfield (Smuel L. Jackson) reciting a Biblical passage, prior to shooting a couple of people.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"A decade after Quentin Tarantino produced two absolute classics in RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION, many of us are still waiting for him to redisplay the enormous virtuosity evidence in both of these films. Although not a bad film, FOXY BROWN was a bit of a disappointment, and we will have to wait and see what happens with KILL BILL and INGLORIOUS BASTARDS, the former finished and scheduled for a fall 2003 release, the latter scheduled to begin shooting in late 2003. For me, PULP FICTION was as original and as exciting as any film I had seen in ages when it came out in 1994, and I was looking forward to a worthy successor to it. I am still looking forward to it.  (Note:  in late 1994 I was even asked by a WGN Chicago film crew--which was polling Chicagoans leaving the theater--my favorite film of the year, and I replied instantly:  PULP FICTION.)This disappointment aside, PULP FICTION was one of the most incredible film experiences of my life. Retaining much of the edge and incredible dialog that was found in both RESERVOIR DOGS and TRUE ROMANCE, for which Tarantino wrote the script, but injecting precisely the right blend of Americana and popular culture, the film blew me out of my seat. Immediately after seeing it, I saw it again, and then again. The film had style and swagger to burn, humor to soften the violence and give it a surreal turn, and simple the greatest talk I had ever heard in the movies. All the characters in the film love to talk, and many are brilliant at it.PULP FICTION is filled with more great moments than are usually found in three or four good films added together. Many of the segments are more or less self-contained, and would be classics on their own, but added to the others produce something even greater than the sum of its parts. You get the extraordinary hit that Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta make at the beginning of the film. The surreal trip to the nostalgia diner and twist contest with Travolta and Uma Thurman. The unbelievable sequence with Bruce Willis and the ""Gimp."" Christopher Walken's tale about the watch and its presentation to the young Bruce Willis character. And this listing doesn't come close to naming all the best moments in the film, and leaves out perhaps the best of the bunch, Samuel L. Jackson's extraordinary scene to end the film.What a cast! There are a host of great performances, although I have to express some perplexity as to why Travolta received the nomination for Best Actor and not Samuel L. Jackson. While Travolta has one more scene than Jackson, in all the scenes where the two are together, Jackson absolutely and utterly dominates the action. We don't listen to Travolta; we listen to Jackson. If you removed Travolta from those scenes, nothing would be lost. Remove Jackson, and you wouldn't have anything remotely resembling the same scene. Still, Travolta is good, if not as dominating as Jackson. So many performers excel: Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, the stunning Harvey Keitel, Eric Stolz, Christopher Walken. And to this day it remains the best thing that Bruce Willis has ever done.Special mention must also be made of the superb soundtrack. I'm not sure that a soundtrack has ever been used to greater effect than in this one, from edgy rawness of Dick Dale's ""Misirlou"" (helping to reacquaint many with the man who truly is the King of the Surf Guitar) to Dusty Springfield's ""Son of a Preacher Man"" to Al Green's ""Let's Stay Together"" to Chuck Berry's ""You Never Can Tell"" the music doesn't merely adorn the film but establishes the proper mood and carries the story forward."	5.0	One of the great and most original films of the nineties	2003-06-03	3	2	1
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	"Almost everyone I know who has seen this film either loves it or hates it but all agree that it is almost impossible to take your eyes off of the screen. Pulp Fiction not only attracts our attention, it demands it. Much credit must be given to director Quentin Tarantino who co-authored the Academy Award winning best original screenplay with Roger Avary. The influences on his development as a filmmaker are too numerous to list here but it is worth noting that Orson Welles, Daffy Duck, Akiro Kurosawa, Dashiell Hammett, Spike Lee, and Francois Truffaut would be on it. Many believe that this film saved John Travolta's career. His portrayal of the dangerous but somewhat dimwitted hit man, Vincent Vega, is brilliant. In fact, Tarantino assembled an outstanding cast and somehow coordinated the various plots in which they are involved. Destinies intersect, sometimes causing violent collisions. The film's accelerated pace, however, does not preclude ""eye of the hurricane"" moments as when Vincent dances with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) in a nightclub or when Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) and Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) are held against their will by a psychopath. Tarantino has a very traditional view of film making: He wants vivid PICTURES and he wants them to MOVE. He also cherishes effective use of language, almost to the point that some scenes seem ""talky."" My guess (only a guess) is that because Tarantino seems to be a compulsive conversationalist, he and members of his cast and crew never stopped talking about Pulp Fiction from the beginning to the end of its production and that many of them are still discussing it nine years after it was first released.This is a nasty, sometimes violent, occasionally hilarious, but never dull film. To those seeing it for the first time who almost immediately become uncomfortable, my advice is to be patient and allow the narrative to continue. You may end up being repulsed. Fair enough. But you may also find yourself enjoying what is deliberately and pre-eminently an unorthodox examination of how MOVING PICTURES can tell a story with compelling impact. For me, the vivid images and my emotional reactions to them dominate the literate, at times loopy dialogue. FYI, the special features provided with the DVD Miramax Collector's Edition include ""Pulp Fiction: The Facts"" (an original documentary), behind-the-scenes montages, a production design featurette, a Siskel & Ebert At The Movies feature (""The Tarantino Generation""), Tarantino's Cannes Film Festival - Palm d'Or acceptance speech, his appearance on the Charlie Rose Show, and various reviews and articles which discuss the film."	5.0	Love it or hate it but you can't take your eyes off it	2004-06-03	4	2	2
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3RJ3L9QSGG3ZW	"Roberto Garzona ""lerroskywalker"""	Some people think this movie is all about violence, but it really isn't.  Yeah, sure, some guys get shot at and the language is rather strong, specially for someone like one's mother or something like that, but what it really is about is the struggles of everyday people in situations that can well happen to almost anybody (ok, maybe the OD scene and the adrenaline inyection to the heart are a little bit out there but still quite good entertainment), the conversations are ridiculouslly realistic and pointless, just like any conversation you might have with everyday people.  So, the bottom line is this movie is a classic because it reinvented the way movies are done, great dialogues and great way of editing the film, with the movie beginning and ending at the same place and at the same time.  Tarantino at his best.  This DVD in particular is really good, the special features are nice, and the packaging is quite remarkable, quite the Collector's Edition it claims to be...	5.0	Violently Funny and witty...	2006-03-17	6	3	3

The international trailers for the film were okay. But for any fan of this incredible film, what makes the set worth the price are three things: the synchronized trivia game, the independent spirit awards footage, and, if you missed it, the dialog with Charlie Rose.

Can't say the same about the Bruce Willis part (other than odd and shocking).  Seems like unnecessary violence for the sake of indulging in violence.  Whereas the other two stories used violence as a tool for humor, this story leaves nothing but the urge to skip it left.Bottom line: Undoubtedly watch Sam Jackson/Uma Thurman parts, skip Bruce Willis unless you must.	4.0	Weird, but quotable	2013-04-12	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8	Roger J. Buffington	This is an odd film, very stylistic and with a meandering and disjointed plot punctuated with lots of surprises.  Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta put in terrific performances as the leads in this film.  Jackson in particular reminds us in this film why he is one of the greats. The amount of profanity (and frequent use of the N-word) in this film, and graphic portrayal of drug use are all pretty jarring, but if you can get past that (I did, with difficulty) there is a pretty good film here.  This one manages to be both hilarious and serious at the same time. It is easy to see why this one has become a cult classic and guilty pleasure for millions of film aficionados.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3AD071UEP20WS	"Roger Long ""longrush"""	"This film breaks at least a couple of ""rules"" that apply to the novel or a movie.  First, there is not a single character in it that the viewer can like.  They are all human dregs, with no use whatever to society.  Second, the plot is not continuous, and the viewer has to reassemble the pieces.  These faults should destroy the movie--but somehow they don't.In fact, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  It is amazing that the director/writer could break such cardinal rules and produce a masterpiece.  Is it the acting?  Partly.  The acting is certainly excellent.  Travolta plays a stupid, druggie, ugly hit man to perfection.  Samuel L. Jackson is a vicious but childlike killer who sees great meaning where none exist.  The others in the cast are equally good, full of contradictions as people are.  The dialogue is different from any other film I have seen--it's disjointed, real.  People think they are making sense when they are not, just like in real life.There's nothing uplifting or feelgood about this movie, and I can see why a great many people would not like it or be offended by it.  But it is still a real picture of the human condition."	5.0	Rules made to be broken	2008-11-21	3	1	2

And I LOVE the running joke in the film (that being of Travolta alway's stuck in the  loo whenever anything goes wrong). The editing was imaginative, throwing  every character together at one point or another, and instead of the  average ending (which would have been Willis and his girlfriend riding of  into the sunset) we have the film going out in blazes.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2L7XBXW29NL3V	R. Rangel	Pulp Fiction is probably one of the greatest movies of the 1990's, but is it the best? No of course not. It's just ONE of them, but not it.The movie in some way is unique and has some memorable dialogue and characters. But let's face it...It's completely OVERRATED. I swear I have seen this movie in every TV network I change it to. It's on almost every other week, even on HBO, STARZ & MAX. I have yet to see any other of his movies on TV like Reservoir Dogs or Jackie Brown. It's just Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction.Alot of his fans considered this to be Tarantino's best film, but honestly Reservoir Dogs was much better in terms of everything: characters, dialogue, storyline, directing, acting; even if it was a low-budget film, it still rocked.The movie is great, but like I said it has too much hype surrounding it. If it didn't maybe the movie could have been perfect. That's why I give it 3 stars - I would give it 3.5 stars but I can't. Great movie, but the hype totally takes 2 stars away from it...it gets 3 stars.	3.0	Great movie...but simply overrated.	2008-03-18	2	0	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1QU6K5C0OVGSM	"""ruthlessvillan"""	First of all, let me state that I'm a huge fan of crime movies from Goodfellas to Menace II Society. And Quentin Tarantino has scored some major hits as a director, this being one of them (moneywise). And the actors here like Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta have all displayed more than a little talent. I felt this movie was grasping at something, as in Samuel L. Jackson's philosphical discussions, or the use of Biblical passages before murders. But it never really got a chance to develop. The car ride back after the first set of murders was a chance, but they blew it by having the guy in the backseat killed, etc., there was a lot of potential for development. Also, the Bruce Willis aspect was preety pointless, and the scene in the gun store was funny in a way, but still did not contribute. While attempting to connect the stories, and illustrate a certain point, Pulp Fiction does not suceed, and that is what hurts this movie.	2.0	Not all it was hyped to be	2002-01-07	11	3	8

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3AKPY4LXIC24O	Ryan Costantino	Pulp Fiction was the movie to see in 1994!  A huge ensemble cast, insanely hilarious story(s), a killer soundtrack, and top notch direction from  Quentin Tarantino make this one of the best jaw-dropping films ever!  It's  hard to pick a favorite performance:  There's John Travolta's ultra-cool  (but not to smart when it comes to taking a dump at a potential hit's  apartment) Vincent Vega , way suave with the ladies and super responsible  to the end.  Or there's the scripture spouting, jerry-curl toting Samuel L.  Jackson, the voice of reason who always keeps his cool.  The tough as  nails, don't tread on me, boxer played by Bruce Willis.  The beautiful Uma  Thurman in a heart stopping performance.  Ving Rhames as the violated crime  boss.  Eric Stoltz as the hippy drug dealer.  Tim Roth as the small time  crook.  Harvey Keitel as Mr. Wolf (or is it Mr. Clean).  Tarantino himself  as a way too stressed, slur spewing owner of a garage and some really dorky  clothes.Extreme in its violence, outlandish in its performances, the  best part of the movie is in the dialogue alone.  Theological discussions  over murder or just a reason not to eat pork the magic in Pulp Fiction lies  in the script!  At least Tarantino wasn't gipped out at the Academy Awards  on that front.  A timeless  classic that is definitely not for the kiddies.  If you don't own the movie or the soundtrack you either weren't born when  this movie came out, aren't human, or have a serious lack of a social life.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A6FIAB28IS79	Samuel Chell	"John Waters recently produced a countercultural personal manifesto, ""Cecille B. Demented,"" in which he specifically targets two of the most depressiingly bad, yet representative, films of the 90's--""Patch Adams"" and ""Forrest Gump."" But Waters' strained, juvenile ranting, for whatever therapeutic value it contains, is ultimately as lame and ineffectual as the films occasioning his rage. The only effective response to the mind-deadening, sedating Pavlonian formulas that pass for movies these days is a truly fresh, well crafted, yet perpetually playful, cinematic statement like Tarantino's dazzling ""Pulp Fiction."" Whatever you've heard, it's no ""Citizen Kane,"" but in the context of the films of the day, its style and methods are certainly analagous to Welles' breakthrough film. If any proof of ""Pulp Fiction's"" singular artistry is needed, just compare it to ""Natural Born Killers,"" Oliver Stone's subsequent, over-the-top attempt to beat Tarantino at his own game. Whereas Tarantino knows how to amuse and delight by using familiar patterns (the variation on the buddy theme, for example) which engage our human interest despite the unexpected contexts, Stone merely distances us from all the mayhem on screen, which generates about as much interest as watching someone else play a video game.But now I'm going to suggest something shocking, especially to all those hip critics and postmodern types who insist ""Pulp Fiction"" is a statement against meaning and interpretation, that the whole point of the cinematic experience is the experience, that ""Pulp Fiction"" is a 90's cinematic fun house, a celluloid carnival ride on which you go with the flow and miss the trip if you attempt to question any of the moments comprising its visual rush: The film has a potent message. As retro as Jules looks with his Afro-do, he's also a questioning Samuel, a wayward Old Testament prophet trying to sort out the meaning of justice, righteousness, and grace. When I ask young people about the film, they see Jules' ""transition"" as proof of a character who changes for the better, who for one moment at the end of the film stops being a self-appointed executor and takes on the role of the protective, forgiving Good Shepherd.Truthfully, I find the foregoing interpretation reductive. What's significant, however, is that many young viewers make an intepretation at all. In a culture that has for all appearances rejected the unexamined life in favor of measuring identity by MacDonald's vs. Burger King consumer tastes, Jules' act of interpretation is all the more noteworthy. And he offers not one, but no less than 4 interpretations of Ezekiel 25:17 before reaching the one that forces him to acknowledge both the thoughtlessness and arrogance of his previous interpretations. It's a moment, perhaps, that does not convince us of its lasting impact. But then again, Jules, like most of us, makes no claim to being ""saved"": he's in a state of ""transition,"" doing the best he can to be a ""good Shepherd"" as much of the time as he's able. What more could any of us ask of Jules--or, for that matter, of ourselves?"	5.0	Breath of Fresh Air, and Nourishment for the Soul.	2002-01-31	8	5	3

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2INSWKRRN4KDL	Samuel W. Potter	"""Pulp Fiction"" is an American icon, epitomizing the feelings of the nineties and pointing the Gen-Y generation in the direction it has ended up in now. Is the film entertaining? Absolutely. Tarantino is a master of witty repartee, his characters engaging in a number of entertaining conversations. However, many of these serve merely as entertainment, and don't reveal much in the way of character or story. Much has been made of the ""royale with cheese"" conversation, but there's really not much to it if you're looking to dive deep into the characters.Many of these are fascinating, however, in the way they reveal small truths about life to which we can relate. My favorite is Travolta and Thurman's conversation about how people should just sometimes ""shut the f**k up"". However, this proves to be a reflexive move, as many times I found myself thinking the same thing when the characters rambled on far too long.Much has also been made about the broken narrative structure of the film. It works here mainly because of Tarantino's objective: to tell stories like the pulp dimestore novels he read as a kid. However, the fragmented narrative doesn't really further the story any.The performances are fun to watch, particularly Samuel L. Jackson. This is HIS movie, and his dialogue and mannerisms are so in tune with Tarantino's writing, you wonder if this is how Jackson really is in life (hope not). Travolta, Thurman, Willis and all are entertaining as well.Here are the reasons why I dislike this film, and most of Tarantino's films. First, his characters have little depth. Jules (Jackson) has a great moral arc, as does Travolta. The other characters don't really amount to much. I still wonder why Uma Thurman's character is in this movie, as it seems merely to serve as a slick, hip bit of cinematic cotton candy: fun to watch but not particularly gripping, moving or profound.The same feeling applies to Tarantino's dialogue. They all spout hipster wisdom: the royale with cheese in France, the bit about Madonna in Reservoir Dogs by Tarantino himself. I enjoy it, but it's kind of like listening to that kid you knew in high school who thought he knew everything about everything, and couldn't stop telling you about it. You get sick of it after awhile.Still, for all it's faults, ""Pulp Fiction"" is a lot of bloody, coarse-mouthed fun. Tarantino isn't for everyone: his penchant for profanity, over-the-top violence and quirky narrative structure either annoys or astounds.I'm in the middle. Personally, I think directors like Scorsese and Coppola pull off the crime genre with greater maturity, grace and depth of character.Tarantino is ultimately the cinematic version of some trendy nightclub. Everyone looks cool, talks cool and does hip things, but the pathos, or the ""why"" never really comes out."	3.0	Tarantino In A Nutshell	2005-06-01	11	7	4

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3PX0UHRBGTM2R	Scotington	"The movie is great, and indeed looks awesome on Blu-Ray...But remember when the Collector's Edition of Pulp Fiction included a 16 page Booklet and a Menu from Jack Rabbit Slims?Pulp Fiction (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)I really miss the days when upon opening a new DVD you were actually impressed by the amount care and effort that went into the presentation & packaging of the DVD.The current Blu-Ray release of Pulp Ficition  does away with all that ""unnecessary"" stuff and just gives you the disc, nothing more of value to read or flip through. My Blu-Ray from Amazon came in an ""Eco-Friendly"" case that blows chunks. No printing on the reverse side of the cover that might show a scene or two from the movie, include a list of Chapters, or actor/director Bios; just plain bland white.They did spend some extra money on three different types of anti-theft stickers. I'm sure this prevented untold numbers of thefts from the Local Amazon Stores. Before I could open the case, I had to first remove an outside sticker designed to prevent me from opening the case, simply labled ""Security Device Enclosed"" it performed it's task admirably. Once I got past the first layer of security, and got inside the case I was greeted with two additonal and different anti-theft sticker devices which were both very difficult to remove cleanly, I then threw them away. So much for being Eco-friendly. Can someone please remind me again why Amazon needs security stickers? Since this was a pre-order one would think Mirimax or Lionsgate or whover would know the discs were going to Amazon, who doesn't need them.(Speaking of pre-orders, 6 days after the release date they lowered the price to 12.99 as a Thank-you to all who pre-ordered at 14.99)To be fair, they did include a standard external cardboard sleeve with the classic shot of Uma on the cover. Of course, they slapped two other  Stickers on the front to cover her up. The first sticker tells me I can scan it with my Smartphone and watch the trailer on my 4 inch phone screen, thanks to this 1 1/2 inch ""Wimo Enabled"" sticker. Wow, who WHO KNEW, you could Stream a trailer from the internet and watch it on a web enabled phone? The second sticker was a plain 1 1/4 inch yellow square with the words ""Director Approved"" and Quentin Tarantino's scribled signature. There's also a magic number on it, ""3000017221"". This same number is on the same sticker that's on my Jackie Brown Blu-Ray. I must now look for this whenever I buy a Tarantino Blu-ray release because without it I won't be sure of what I'm getting.Apparently, someone in marketing thinks spending money on stickers will entice someone to buy the Blu-Ray. Even though the average person will likely ignore them or peel them off and damage their cover in the process.In light of a great movie, I feel the release is somewhat lackluster in it's presentation, especially compared to the Collector's Editon DVD released in 2002:Pulp Fiction (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)It would be nice if attention were paid to these types of details so that collectors and fans of film would have something more substantial to show for their money than a Shiny disc and a translucent blu-ray case with recycle arrows carved out of it. Boring shiny discs can be rented using any number of online or local rental options. Were they to make the experience of purchasing Blu-Ray disc a little more special, more people might be inclined to purchase more movies to add to their collections."	4.0	Missing the days of Collector Edition booklets and inserts...	2011-10-18	19	15	4

I was young, just in college, and I might just as well have seen the movie flying by me across the parking lot, a lingerie ad floating toward the trash dumpster.When an earlier reviewer brought up the concept of the film unfolding not in the viewer's sense of reality, but in the characters' reality, I thought of the second time I saw the movie, in a motel room with my uncle. Chain-smoking and debating, we saw the core of the film in those small revelations, the ""bits of flesh"".Yes, the film is flawed. John Travolta, I don't feel he's a killer. I don't.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2JULS9214RB1P	Scotty Runk	Pulp Fiction has been playing on cable, but with the expletives deleted.  This is a fine example of dialog that sounds natural, yet is highly original.  The dirty language is a big part of the movie so you are seeing only part of the movie if you dont hear the original dialog.That brings me to the dvd.  See the movie in its original form.  Scenes that were once shocking may lose their impact upon repeated viewings, but then you realize that the shock value is not the movie's strong point.  The weird wonderful characters and their conversations are the real stars.  Tarentino also pulls the best out of actors, taking them to undiscovered places.  As many forward thinking movies, this film was highly controversial when it was shown in Cannes.  The violence is somewhat surreal and not at all like drivein films.	5.0	See it uncut	2006-08-06	5	3	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1R9GZ8FC44MF5	"Sean ""Dragon Ninja"""	"My last review should not be listened to, see because when i wrote that i hadn't seen the whole thing i got up to the rape scene and said screw this.  But now that i have seen it again i must say that it still isnt that good.  Although it certainly is not a bad movie, it still lacks action and the story isnt all that interesting.  The movie is too long for the story, it fairly simple its a basic hit man crime story all about a simple job involving taking a case, showing the bosses wife a good time, then jewels goes good and vincent gets shot by butch, thats the story very uninteresting.  The rape scene is unecessary and could have been toned down, there is no other real action just some shooting, of course there is style and good music, this is tarantino were talkin here, but i feel this is his worst movie and could have been better.  Overall its a half decent movie that has a certain good feel to it at the end, its got some funny things like ""damn i just shot marvin in the face"".  Kill Bill is much better, this is a movie you should see once, and i understand why most people like it alot, but for me it just doesnt provide me with has much fun as Kill Bill, but its defintly worth a look.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1LEN6BO4XR1DI	Sean Shannon	"The yang to _Forrest Gump_'s yin in 1994, _Pulp Fiction_ was Quentin Tarantino's breakout movie, drawing waves after waves of eager viewers to the theatre without the marketing bonanza of the Tom Hanks feel-good fiesta.  Dark, sometimes disturbing, and altogether different, Tarantino's masterpiece broke all the rules of how to make a blockbuster movie, with tremendous relish.  Unfortunately, this DVD does not do such an outstanding film justice._Pulp Fiction_ is still here in all its letterboxed glory, and anyone who hasn't seen it yet should do so.  Tarantino's acting is the only performance that does not border on amazing, and Tarantino can be forgiven for that for writing such tremendous characters, gritty dialogue and avant-garde plot.  Unfolding the storyline in a non-linear fashion works wonderfully, creating a tremendous climax at the end of the film and adding more to its mystique.  Some may not be able to follow the story because of this, and others may not be able to stomach the abundance of violence and dirty language, but for those who can, the movie itself is cinematic gold.But _Pulp Fiction_ enthusiasts looking for the ""royale with cheese"" DVD treatment will not find it here.  Despite releasing both laserdisc and VHS editions of the movie filled with extras, the DVD features only an alternate Spanish audio track.  The absence of special features, especially for a movie with a large established cult following, is almost unforgivable, particularly as they were already there to be added.If you have not seen _Pulp Fiction_ yet, or you absolutely have to have a DVD copy of it now, purchase this disc.  If you can wait, however, Miramax should release a ""special edition"" laden with bonus features soon (if they have any sense), and you should save your money for that."	4.0	Masterful Movie Marred by Lack of Special Features	2001-04-19	0	0	0

I went from the Farellys to the Coens to Kevin Smith etc, but when i randomly uncovered the talent of Quentin Tarantino, my searching stopped. The way in which this movie is pieced together, by starting and ending in the same scene just forces you to turn off the television with a smile on your face. There's so much witty dialogue to pick p here it's well worth your money buying it just so you can watch it over and over again. As far as movie influences go, i think i would be safe to say that this definitely ranks as one of the top 20 most influencial movies of all time, and i can see how. Althoguh this movie might be seen as offensive in certain scenes (drug antidote scene), it must be seen, even by the squeemish.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A13IKSGDYNBNQS	S J Buck	Pulp Fiction is one of the best American films ever made. As Tarantino was both writer and director the film has his mark all over it. The trademark use of natural dialog that essentially has nothing to with the plot. Scenes are shown chronologically out of sequence, which sounds odd but Tarantino makes it work to his advantage as the loveable rogues are still alive at the end of the film, in the scene where the film started from.Tarantinos casting is perfect. John Travolta is a revelation, Samuel L Jackson is Samuel L Jackson, but this is before we knew who Samuel L Jackson was! Uma Thurman is also great, but in possibly the best scene in the film Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames also turn in teriffic performances. In a lovely cameo role Harvey Keitel also turns up near the end of the film as well.There are cimematic nods to a number of Tarantinos favourite movies as well. The most noteable being the dance scene with Travolta and Thurman which is based on a sequence in Jean-Luc Goddard's 'Bande A Parte'.This is a very violent film, but as the title indicates its a form of comic strip violence, and there is also an underlying black comedy element as well. It is endlessly watchable and quoteable and that is the sign of a really great film.	5.0	Tarantino's Masterpiece	2007-06-15	3	1	2

Only screenplay is good enough,but nothingelse. Tarantino does not have skill to complete a movie(So he can't be a master,auteur) He can't make intelligents to be involved in his movies emotionally.

Also, those with an aversion to strong language should definitely avoid this film.For the rest of us, especially those who appreciate dark humor and/or are fascinated by the criminal ""underworld,"" Pulp Fiction is on a very short list of the best films of all time.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADA great example of the dark humor of this film is the scene where Vincent Vega (Travolta) takes Mia Wallace (Thurman) to the drug dealer's (Eric Stoltz) house after she's overdosed on heroine.  As she lies unconscious and close to death, Lance (the drug dealer) has a hilarious shouting match with his wife (Rosanna Arquette) as he frantically searches for a shot of adrenaline and a medical book.This film is riddled with outstanding dialogue, but for me the best scene was toward the beginning, when Vincent and Jules (Samuel Jackson)--two HIT MEN--are bantering about foot massages right before ""going to work.""Critics say this movie glorifies violence, and to an extent I suppose this is true, but I think the real reason this movie is so entertaining is that many of us ""non-criminal"" types have a natural fascination with the criminal underworld that presumably exists in our own backyard (Los Angeles, in this case).  Tarantino brings these characters to life with such depth, we feel that we know them intimately.  We may not like them in all cases, but we cannot stop watching to see what they'll do next."	5.0	"""I'm just saying, I'm like a race car in the red..."""	2004-08-20	0	0	0

Despite my age, I have found this movie to be extraordinarily unique, having opened an entirely new genre in films.  Hitchcock would have been proud to have seen Tarentino's trend-setting motif, and the many doors his insight has opened.  Shame on those that can't see beyond the ""Hollywood-ness"", and experience the joy of a new dimension within films.  Not all good movies rely on special effects to draw an audience.  Tarentino has proven that...superbly.  Hostel was every bit as riveting, and I highly recommend that movie...unless you are a prude and unable to accept the graphic subject matter covered.

I don't think Pulp Fiction is 'the most' anything (except perhaps 'the most imitated inimitable 70s-imitation-film of all time'). It's nothing but a revolutionary recycling machine. I didn't have a cardiac arrest when I first watched Pulp Fiction- I just tried to figure out what was behind all the technical innovation, witty, disillusioned dialogue and brilliant music. And I found nothing. Attractive, fascinating empty suitcases and postmodernism (which are synonymous). They say that still waters run deep. Maybe Quentin and his badly-assembled cast (John Travolta just doesn't make a very deeply characterized or credible Vincent- perhaps it's a flaw in direction/screenwriting) should stop moving around so much.Nothing is personal in Pulp Fiction. Quentin Tarantino is no 'auteur'. There is no semblance of self-expression or soulful artistry in this film. I don't see the point in making a movie for fun. And I don't see why everybody considers this one a must-watch. What, is tongue-in-cheek BDSM the eighth wonder of the world now? This film's status as a cult classic causes young, aspiring filmmakers to.. oh.. I can't say it.. imitate Quentin Tarantino. Inimitability/imitability notwithstanding, films should be personal. Films used to be personal....Unless this is just an action film, in which case, stop calling it the best movie of all time.	3.0	How to rate an anything-but-classical classic?	2006-01-06	15	3	12

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2MITD3KZ1BIQP	Sparky McShine	A decade after its release, Pulp Fiction is considered a landmark of American cinema. But I've read the many 'one-star' reviews here, and I see common themes: that the movie glorifies senseless violence, drug use, and profanity; that the movie is unoriginal and that Tarantino is a bad actor; that the characters are unlikable. Many complain on moral grounds: that Pulp is 'useless and depressing trash,' and that the audience laughs when people die, as in a Roman colosseum. A common complaint by these guys is that they 'just don't get' the movie.Here's the secret of the movie, what those who dislike it don't see: Pulp Fiction is a cartoon, in every sense of the word but one. Tarantino hints at this throughout the movie in various ways (In Kill Bill, of course, he removes all ambiguity by actually including a lengthy animated sequence). If you laugh when Wile E. Coyote plunges two thousand feet off a cliff, you shouldn't be disturbed when Vincent Vega accidentally splatters Marvin all over the inside of the car. I dislike cinematic violence; I barely made it through Scorsese's brutal 'Casino' and wouldn't watch it again, because the violence is realistic and unsettling. But movies like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'A Clockwork Orange' are fantasy; they ask for (and earn) the right to be seen on their own terms.Cartoons have to tread a very fine line, in accordance with the laws of their universe: it's okay for Bugs Bunny to squash Elmer Fudd with a boulder, but it wouldn't be okay for Bugs to fart while he does it; that would be a cheap, unearned laugh. Likewise, Pulp Fiction is free from any 'serious' violence, except in one scene: Butch (Bruce Willis) blowing away Vincent (John Travolta) as he steps out of the toilet (the `Pop-Tart' scene). Tarantino doesn't play this scene for laughs because it represents something serious: Vincent's lack of redemption. Vincent dies as he lived: a common, narrow-minded thug with no aspirations to anything better. Butch and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson), however, extricate themselves from their lives of crime.An in-depth analysis of Pulp Fiction, its meaning, and its characters would fill a book. Those who complain about the violence, profanity, and unlikable characters are judging it in terms of a standard Hollywood movie, which it isn't. I may not know for sure how history will judge Tarantino, but my guess is that he'll be placed in the company of Kurosawa and Hitchcock in terms of talent and genius.	5.0	One of the greats.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3R8PXSFGY9MC2	Spider Monkey	After `Reservoir Dogs', `Pulp Fiction' is the film that cemented Tarantino's place in the film world as a director/writer of distinction.  On repeated viewings you can see why and I still marvel at the style of this film.This is made up of a series of vignettes around LA and with a core of the same characters, until everything comes full circle and ties up at the end.  This delivers a fast paced, gritty storyline and whilst the humour is certainly dark, it can't help but make you laugh.  The cast is outstanding and Travolta, Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis all turn out stellar performances.It goes some way to show how enduring a film is if lines or scenes from it are still quoted many years after it was made and this is definitely one of those film.  The amount of times I have seen a pastiche of this or heard lines from it on TV or from friends is incredible.  The direction is amazing, with a few scenes standing out (like Willis leaning against a wall in close up, with Ving Rhames character chasing him down an alley in the distance),simple perfection.  The plot is excellent too with the non-chronological vignettes unweaving the story as it goes.  The soundtrack, as in most Tarantino film, is a key element and each song matches the scene perfectly and the interaction between the music and actors is a sight to behold (again I`m thinking of the now iconic scene where Uma Thurman dances the twist with Travolta).This is highly lauded and beloved by many fans for good reason and if you haven't seen this yet then snap it up and if you have seen it, then add this to your discerning film collection.	5.0	Pulp Fiction	2011-03-06	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A29BQ6B90Y1R5F	S. Rhodes	"When you ask people what the greatest movie ever made was; you're apt to get reponses like: Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Star Wars, The Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption.But often times you'll also hear about a little film called ""Pulp Fiction"".  The film that saved Miramax, and made Quentin Tarantino one of the most well known directors in the history of filmaking!Let's get one thing straight.  This is a movie about character analysis and dialogue.  It is also a movie about nothing!  That's right, it's a movie about nothing!  As the name of the film implies, it's a Pulp Fiction.  Put simple, if Seinfeld was a movie, this would be it.What's unique about ""Pulp Fiction"" is simple.  It's a film that begins techniquely at the end, then starts over somewhere in the middle and gets to that ending.  It jumps around for good reason though, and while it's confusing at first, it all comes together.The film is divided into ""stories"" (again, it's called ""Pulp"" Fiction).  We begin with a prologue seeing ""Pumpkin"" (played by Tim Roth) and ""Honey Bunny"".  This is the first dose of major dialogue!  This is before even the opening credits!  It takes at least six minutes, and ends with them deciding to rob a restaurant.  Cue up the music and opening credits and get ready to watch a ""Pulp"" fiction unfold.  Even before the movie begins they give you a dictionary definition of ""Pulp"" and ""Fiction"" (and if you can't see why the movie is plotless after that you're hopeless!).In the first story, we see Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) on their way to retrieve a briefcase for their boss Marsellis Wallice.  You never get to see what's in the briefcase, but according to Director Quentin Tarantino, it can be whatever you want it to be.But as we see this film in the first story, you'll realize the dialogue is the highest point in the film.  The story between Jules and Vincent opens up with a classic ""Royale with cheese"" discussion.  It's hillarious, smart and clever dialogue.Once the first story ends, we're seen with Vincent again, taking his boss's wife on a date.  He declares ""It's not a date,"" but we know that no one can resist the charm of Mia Wallace (played by the magnificant ""bride"" Uma Thurman).Then we go to Butch (Bruce Willis) who is faced with a dilemma put on him by Mr. Wallice.  It all involves a Gold Watch, a fight he should've lost, and Mr. Wallice falling in the hands of some inhumane people.Finally, we have the epilogue in which the movie starts over and we're back to Jules and Vincent.  This involves them getting into what the movie dubs ""The Bonnie Situation"" in which they have a dead body they're trying to dispose of in their car.  After that situation, we're back in the restaurant where the movie started!When the movie comes to a close, you'll probably be asking, ""What was that all about?""  Simple.  Characters and dialogue.  It's nothing but witty and kookie dialogue.  There is a lot of language (the ""F"" word comes up a lot) but it shouldn't bother the majority of movie goers.  Just keep your kids far away.Truly though, the brilliance of this movie comes not from Quentin Tarantino's dialogue or directing, but from Mr. Samuel L. Jackson.  He delivers such powerful lines in a tone that strikes fear into us all at some point.  But he comes off as more than just ""playing"" Jules.  He actually IS Jules, and we grow to apprecieate him.Pulp Fiction is a cult classic!  It's everywhere these days.  You'll notice the film has no high-tec special effects (and if you're an action fanatic picking up Pulp Fiction, something is wrong with you), or even a freakin' storyline!  It's nothing but good ""Pulp"" fun!So sit back and enjoy!  Laugh, quote and admire what Quentin Tarantino has presented here."	5.0	It's nothing but Pulp!	2005-04-22	1	1	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3DY46ZABF4CMQ	"S. Sarhan ""matured reviewer"""	Pulp Fiction remains the most powerful movie of the past decade. Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece recieves its much deserved special edition treatment with plenty of goodies. We have some behind the scenes look at the making of some of the sequences of Pulp Fiction, interviews with cast and crew, award ceremonies where Pulp Fiction was named winner, and some very interesting facts revolving around how the movie was made and what was used on screen. The movie also features a subtitled commentary on the film with important, if you are a big fan, information for each shot or scene.Put this big load of features aside, the movie itself is worth owning this DVD for. What can I not say about Pulp Fiction. It is a perfect 10 movie when it comes to scaling fairly. Tarantino put all of his heart, effort and witty talent on paper and then transformed the words into images that created this film. Whatever Tarantino made afterwards wouldn't matter, he will still be viewed as the modern day film revolution starter. Yes, Pulp Fiction was a revolutionary piece of work. The film mixes violence with humor in a way that I have not seen before. The dialogue is the highlight of Pulp Fiction, you will do more listening to Pulp Fiction than actually watching it. You can literally close your eyes and still enjoy Pulp Fiction. Tarantino uses imitations of real life conversations between his characters that makes you feel intimate with these people onscreen. Our leading gangsters Vincent Vega, played brilliantly by John Travolta, and Jules Winfield's, played even more brilliantly by Samuel Jackson, conversation about Amsterdam, the metric system and what they put on french fries in Holland instead of Ketchup (mayonnaise!) on their way to finish a kill is both hilarious as it seems realistic. The graphics are a combination of Tarantino now reknowned trademark; gangsters in black suits; with a touch of homage to his favorite films, whether its blaxploitation flicks; Samuel Jackson's hairdo; or Deliverance type thrillers; the infamous rape scene; or Samurai ninja flicks; the sword Bruce Willis uses to kill some very bad guys. Yet, you get the sense of Tarantino's inspirations with the soundtrack. The music that Tarantino produced himself and added to many scenes of his movie is a combination of R&amp;B; Al Green's Let's Stay Together; Funk; Kool And The Gang's Jungle Boogie; and western/country; counting Flowers On The Wall.This makes Pulp Fiction not just a movie but one big entertainment experience that stood, and still stands, the test of time.If you haven't been Pulp Fiction-ized yet, well its about time.This special edition is a must-haveA+	5.0	The best movie of the past decade	2003-12-27	2	1	1

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AXJ1NBETLL1O	Stephen Calabria	&quot; Pulp Fiction&quot; is a brilliant piece of filmmaking. It was a completely innovative idea by director Quentin Tarantino and should be commended for it's grat use of black comedy blended in with the gruesome violence and the understandable bad language.For those who think that a movie should be judged on it's gore content, it's &quot;naughty language&quot;, or it's use of drugs, should be shot. There are plenty of other things that make a movie. Little things like story, dialogue, chemistry between characters, writing, directing, and basic entertainment value all play pivitol roles in how you judge a movie, and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; had all of them. As for gore, language, and drugs, these were put in intentionally for you to get the feel of what the times were like that the characters were living in.With a superb cast, great direction, and a kickass soundtrack, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; clearly earns its five stars.	5.0	Incredible!	2001-06-28	1	1	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AR36LQWMA4T0H	Stephen G. Nelson	After countless nagging and mockery by my friends, I finally decided to go out and buy Pulp Fiction. And I sure am glad that I did! As my friend Froggy told me, &quot;this film will change your life.&quot; I can't say that it has, but Samuel L. Jackson is now the coolest man on the planet. This film, although filled with disturbing images and too much swearing, strikes a chord within the human heart. These charters are just trying to get through the muck of life doing only what they know how to do. In this case, murdering, fighting, and abusing people. They don't necessarily enjoy doing what they do, it is just a fact of their life and doesn't disturb them. This doesn't make them evil, just ignorant in some ways. It even goes into love a little bit, although it doesn't get very deep. This film is great because it shows constant human struggle and those same people overcoming the odds and persevering through them.	5.0	An excellent film!	2004-07-21	1	1	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	No summary, character analyzation or storylines here.  That has been written by just about everyone else on Amazon so I will focus solely upon the quality of the transfer of this film to Blu Ray.VIDEO....Very very clean transfer with a high bit rate varying between the mid 20's and low 30's.  Skin tones are perfected natural and environmental colors true to life and do not pop as you might see on an action film like Transformers.  Colors do tend to be muted and a touch soft but most colors in real life are just like that anyway.  Contrast for Pulp Fiction is excellent and at no time did I see any noticeable grain or disturbing artifacts.  There are plenty of details to be seen even in the darker, more shadowy areas  as well as skin lines, pores and various textures of objects,  so you know that no one went too far with crushing the blacks.AUDIO...The star of the transfer in my opinion, the lossless DTSHD 5.1 audio is how all 'non-action' films/dramas should be recorded.  With those bombastic adventure films we expect big explosions and sharply delineated use of our surround speakers, but with dramas and films like Pulp Fiction, we often only get use of the center channel speaker and barely much from the surrounds front and back.  Pulp Fiction does it right on this blu ray with great panning from front to rear/rear to front during even mundane actions such as a car driving by. Discreet channeling of background voices and foley fx abound even in their subtlety.  The great music score uses all your home theater and really and fully envelops you into the movie.  I felt I was in the restaurant, both JackRabbit Slim's and the diner, with the characters.Again, there is no bombastic explosions driving your surrounds and not a whole lot for your LFE channel to work with, but the audio editing for Pulp Fiction sets the standard for this type of film where others of this type just settle for center channel use.  Discreet dialogue is transparent and easy to hear and understand.  The audio levels for the wonderful soundtrack do not overwhelm either the action or the dialogue and there is no need to play roller coaster with your remote control's volume.Extras include some deleted scenes, each introduces and explained sincerely and without BS by director Tarantino who makes it a point that while he liked the scenes, the theatrical release on this Blu Ray is the way he wanted it so not to expect a future 'extended' cut.Also included are a new  Not the Usual Mindless Boring Getting to Know You Chit Chat which is about 45 minutes long and goes far beyond the normal, and often boring and self congratulations of many 'Making of's documentaries.  Another extras is a round table discussion of the film, a great interview with Tarantino and considerably more some of which I have not yet watched.All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.Thanks for reading.	5.0	Pulp Fiction on Blu Ray	2013-05-25	2	2	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2RHQMV5GD18Z8	Steven Aldersley	Pulp Fiction (1994)Crime, Thriller, 154 minutesDirected by Quentin TarantinoStarring John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Christopher Walken and Harvey KeitelIt's not easy to write about Pulp Fiction. The plot is deliberately non-linear and we follow several stories at once. The opening scene is set in a diner and we see two people discussing the virtues of robbing restaurants. The closing scene returns to that same diner and we see the result of their attempts as they interact with other characters we meet during the course of the story.Crime is a recurring theme and part of the story focuses on Jules Winnfield (Jackson) and Vincent Vega (Travolta) as they carry out hits for their boss. We get to know these characters well, and that's one thing that makes Pulp Fiction great. Tarantino's dialogue is very distinctive. It's funny and true to life, but it also provides plenty of exposition and characterization. You will come away from Pulp Fiction feeling as if you know Jules and Vincent. Like any employee, they talk about things other than their job. Whether it's burgers, miracles, or foot massages, it's always entertaining.Another thread follows Butch (Willis). He's a boxer who is paid to fix a fight, but he wins anyway. That means he has to go on the run.One thing I like about Tarantino is the structure of his films. He regularly includes a scene immediately before a sequence to explain the motivations of the characters in that scene. In Kill Bill 2, remember how Beatrix was shown learning skills from Pai Mei immediately before her escape from the grave? In Pulp Fiction, Butch is given a watch. Christopher Walken's cameo is one of the funniest I have seen in any film. He explains how he and his father protected the watch and why it's important that Butch looks after it. This explains why Butch will risk death to return to his apartment and recover the watch later in his life.A third story shows Vincent taking Mia Wallace (Thurman) out for the night. Her husband is likely to kill him if he makes a wrong move, so his night is filled with tension. The dialogue is at its best when the two talk in the restaurant. Tarantino makes some good observations, such as why we feel the need to talk about trivial things rather than enjoy the silence.All of the characters are connected with each other. Butch will eventually meet Vincent and Mia's husband. Vincent and Jules will meet the robbers shown in the opening scene.Perhaps the best story in the entire film involves Winston Wolfe (Keitel). He's a man who knows how to solve problems and he doesn't waste a second or expect anyone to deviate from his instructions. An unfortunate accident leaves Jules and Vincent in an awkward predicament. They have to dispose of a body and remove all traces of the incident. Tarantino even makes a cameo in this chapter as Jimmy.Pulp Fiction will confound some viewers because it doesn't follow an established structure. A character might die in one scene and show up later in the film. The plot meanders all over the place and offers a glimpse into the lives of these colorful characters. It's not important what happens to them; it's more an exercise in style and mood. Pulp Fiction happens in an unfamiliar world.The music and dialogue are vital ingredients in any Tarantino film and this one is no different. The actors have so much fun delivering his words. If you focus on Jackson, it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the part of Jules so well. Willis plays Butch in the same way. There are unlikely alliances, a Mexican standoff, shots of women's feet, shots from inside a car trunk and all the things you would expect from Tarantino.I've heard people complain about the violence in Pulp Fiction, but there aren't actually many deaths and most of the violence isn't directly shown. One thing I should mention is the language. If you are sensitive to excessive swearing, this film might not be for you. But the swearing does fit the characters and it always feels authentic.Tarantino's films are a lot of fun. If you have a sense of humor that's similar to mine, you might find it among the funniest material available on film. I grin my way through all his films and Pulp Fiction feels about an hour shorter than it actually is.The Blu-ray presentation is just about perfect.	5.0	I could listen to these characters talk for hours	2012-03-12	3	3	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2NU8YF1SL1UVJ	Steven Barnett	This was the first time I ever heard people in a theater laughing at a rape scene, including women.  When these reviewers put the words &quot;funny&quot; and &quot;rape&quot; in the same sentence, don't they stop to think about what they're saying?  Probably not.This movie, along with others like &quot;Natural Born Killers,&quot; started a tidal wave of freakshow films that present extreme violence and brutality in &quot;hip, new&quot; ways...and the trend continues to this day.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A137ZULLBDI4IE	TBone	Tarantino must have been in an alterted state of mind when he wrote this script. A perfect example of this is when Uma Thurman told John Travolta not to be such a square and drew a square in the air and you could actually see the outline of a real square! Who does that? Unecessary but cool. That's basically the whole movie: Unecessary but cool. Someone in a previous review noted that this movie gives the average joe a glimpse into the underworld. I would never know about gimps being locked up had I not seen this movie. Question: Was the gimp in this movie a gimp because he wanted to be a gimp or was he being held hostage to be a gimp? This movie is a slice of life kind of movie. Granted, not a slice of my life but who wants to watch a movie of my slice? It's just a bunch of stuff you watch for two hours. You also have to watch the movie several times to figure out what happened before what b/c the plot is nonlinear. Again, I would like to note that there are many disturbing and disgusting scenes in this movie, but that's OK. I give it 5 stars based on originality and creativeness. By the way, while I'm typing, I would like to say something to anyone considering writing a movie review on Amazon: Please don't waste everybodys time by rehashing the plot in your own words! How annoying! We've seen the darn movie already, we don't need you retelling the plot to us for crying out loud! Tell us how the movie made you feel, why you liked it or disliked it, etc. See you at the movies.	5.0	Weird and disturbing	2004-07-24	3	1	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F	"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard"""	"Quentin Tarantino became a household name after the release of ""Pulp Fiction"" in 1994. He directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Roger Avary depicting the underbelly crime scene of the greater Los Angeles area. John Travolta's career took an upward turn after a series of Hollywood flops in this masterpiece playing a hit man who works alongside another psychotic maniac, played superbly with unapologetic force by Samuel L. Jackman. The story mainly deals with their encounters with many shaddy creatures in the drug trade as the film's backdrop. Uma Thurman plays the wife of a mob boss who ""loves to powder her nose"" frequently. Uma's portrayal in ""Pulp Fiction"" is downright disturbing as well as being hilarious which adds to the different elements of her character. Bruce Willis and Harvey Keitell have supporting roles.""Pulp Fiction"" would receive a whopping seven Academy Award nominations including one for Best Picture. Quentin and Roger Avary would win one of the most acclaimned Oscars, for Best Original Screenplay.On a paltry budget of $8,000,000, ""Pulp Fiction"" has so far grossed an incredible $212,000,000 at the worldwide boxoffice becoming one of the biggest films ever.The DVD is filled with bonuses, including documentaries, Quentin's appearance on PBS' ""The Charlie Rose Show"", featurettes, TV Spots, still galleries, deleted scenes, and more."	5.0	"""One Of The Best Films Of All-Time"""	2010-06-07	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1JIW8GOSSGUQR	"T. Gore ""old_sckool"""	"I am not usually one to care at all when certain movies are released in Fullscreen Mode (and not avaiable in Widescreen) or if they are released in Dolby Mono sound. In fact its great to have some of the classic films of the 50's, 60's, 70's, and 80's all avaiable on DVD. I do own a widescreen TV, so if I can get the format in Widescreen, I do so. Yet there is no excuse when I blockbuster hit such as Pulp Fiction is released on DVD with no 5.1 Dolby Surround, and the movie is letterboxed and not enhanced for 16x9 TV's (which means the movie is in a 4:3 aspect ratio, but its letterboxed, and it really looks no better then a letterboxed or Widescreen copy version that would be avaiable on VHS)I figure that I would send out this warning to those that are wanting to choose between the two copies avaiable here on Amazon. The first is the copy I own, which is the original 1 Disc DVD version. The other is a two disc version which is the special edition. It has DTS and 5.1 Surround added, but I have no idea if this version has enhanced the widescreen viewing for 16x9 aspect ratios. If you had you pick, I would stay away from the single disc version, and get the special edition 2 disc DVD, even if the picture isnt changed (which once again, I am un-sure) at least you get ""true 5.1 or DTS sound) There are those that might love the fact that the movie is letterboxed and not in fullscreen, as I know people that bought all their movies during VHS and Laserdisc days in letterbox or Widescreen modes if avaiable. I happen to be the opposite, I rather see fullscreen, then have the thing letterboxed with no 16x9 enhancement, because I see a huge dip in picture quality, even when letterboxed, with no 16x9 enhancement. Hope this helps some of you out when choosing which version to get (and for those looking for fullscreen, Amazon has copies on VHS for one cent.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A95VRSOD89ABV	The Edible Cannibal	Pulp Fiction is a movie that you never get tired of. It's very memorable, yet you forget enough of it to make you want to see it again. The characters also draw you back to the movie. John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman all give the performances of a lifetime in this classic gangster hit. Christopher Walken also gives a minuscule but memorable cameo. Like with its predecessor Reservoir Dogs and its follow-up Jackie Brown, Quentin Tarantino uses his signature unconvention structure. Although both are good, neither have achieved the level of perfection, as well as the considerable cult following, that Pulp Fiction has.Pulp Fiction is not as much a story as it is a series of short stories that intercept each other somewhere in the middle. The story basically goes like this; Butch Coolidge, a boxer, is told that he has to take a dive during a certain match by a gangster, Marcellus Wallace, but ends up literally killing his opponent. Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield are sent to kill Butch, but Butch already skipped town. Meanwhile, Marcellus is out of town and tells Vincent to take out his wife Mia and to show her a good time. This turns into a fiasco when Mia snorts some herione she mistakes as cocaine and loses conciousness. Meanwhile, a pair of robbers/lovers, Ringo and Yolanda, are sitting in a restuarant planning their robbery of  the place, and at the same time, Vincent and Jules are sitting in the exact same restaurant. Meanwhile, Butch's girlfriend forgets Butch's father's gold watch before leaving, a watch that his father had with him all through the war thanks to an especially unpleasant orifice on his body, which is explained in a particularly hilarious flashback featuring the above mentioned Christopher Walken. Sound confusing? Trust me, it WILL make sense.Well, all in all, this is a contemporary classic that anyone, particularly film fans, will enjoy and be fascinated with.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2I29YY8T7PVLZ	the_frog	I am assuming that the reader enjoyed the movie Pulp Fiction in this review, or any other of the COLLECTOR'S EDITION of a movie. If you happen to dislike intense violence or frequent expletives, just keep moving. Wrong film for you. Like linear plots? Pass on this.  Want to know how Samuel L. Jackson went from &quot;that guy who died in those movies&quot; to Hollywood's A-list? Here's your reason. While Bruce Willis is surprisingly excellent, and revived John Travolta gives the best performance of his life (which I rate as &quot;pretty good&quot; overall) and marvelous array of secondary characters litter the film, it is Samuel L. Jackson's burning, brilliant work that truly makes this film more than another highly styled slashfest. (*cough* Kill Bill *cough*)But that is not why you want the Collector's Edition, is it? You want the extra materials. Well, if you want to find a more self-aggrandizing set of material about a movie, you will be hard-pressed to find someone to defeat this set. Included in the package is a glowing review from Entertainment Weekly, Siskel and Ebert's loving half-hour feature &quot;The Tarantino Generation&quot; and an adulatory documentary. While I realize most special features tend to have the director and cast patting themselves on the back, this set manages to do so without providing a lot of real insightful information. (See: Terminator 2: Extreme Edition for an example of an egotistical  but INFORMATIVE group of special features.)Ultimately, the disc will always have Tarantino's masterpiece digitally captured in all its glory, and that keeps this from being too bad a disc. But someone buying it to get a crack at the special features will probably come away disappointed with their purchase.	3.0	Good movie, lousy special edition	2004-01-24	1	0	1

Yeah, a lot of the dialogue is still ridiculous (in a good way) and funny, but I found 'Reservoir Dogs' to hold up better after repeated viewings.  The dialogue is better, and knowing how the plot is going to break down doesn't subtract from the power of the film.  Ironically, I hated 'Reservior Dogs' when I first saw it.  I had people tell me to see it again, and see if my opinion changed.  It did, although the violence isn't easy to take.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	ATHYT56CA467U	"""the_shinsengumi_shinobi"""	Pulp Fiction is My favorite Movie! Now I could continue to write this hundreds of times but you probably would like some incite as to why. You see very rarely does a movie come out with such great writing that it leaves feeling questioning if what you just saw was fiction. So I guess it helps that the word Fiction is in the title, because if it wasn't I might mistake this for reality. This is not to say this is an incredibly realistic story but the dialouge used sounds like something any body might say. I never heard one line that sounded forced or weird. It all just fits into place. Like the now famous talk about the Mcdonalds in France. Vincent (John Travolta) is telling Jules (Samuel Jackson) about the differences between a French Mcdonalds and an American one. This is a hilarious thing  but also a realistic sounding script, like something you might be talking about on the phone with your friend. This is proof of the greatness of Mr. Tarintino's writing he can make genuinly funny lines out of nothing conversations. The special edition extras are well worth the price, I'd really rather not take the time to write them all but lets just say theres a good amount. The plot is just too hard to explain but I'll just say it involves three different stories that intertwine with eachother. oh and big props for reviving Travolta's carrer.

Ya always  hear people (specialy the one that didn't like the movie)say that this  movie was extremely violent. I don't get it. Why? In comparison 2 other  gansterflix violence doesn't play that bigga roll. Let's take a look at the  bodycount. There's Flock of Seagulls (the guy lying on the couch), his  buddy Brett and the guy with the magnum waiting in the bathroom. And  ofcourse Marvin. In &quot;The Gold Watch&quot; Maynard dies and Zed get's  his &quot;best friend&quot; blown of. He probably dies, but ya don't get 2  see it. That's it. That's six guys! Only six.Another complaint is the  drug abuse and the sex. Let's start with the sex. Marcellus gets raped and  Fabian asked Butch 2 give her &quot;oral pleasure&quot;. Not one breats was  2 be seen, not even a wet T-shirt with a hard nipple. Come on, sex in pulp  fiction?  If anyboy seen it, please tell me cuase i like sex. Then there's  the drugs abuse. Mia almost dies of an O.D. That's it, I rest my  case.But what makes this movie the best ever. It's hard 2 tell, cause  there are many reasons. One of the best reasons is ofcourse the cast, with  Travolta, Jackson, Willis, Thurman, Rhames, Keitel, Roth, Tarantino himself  and Walken amongst others. I can't think of any other movie with a cast  such as this one.  The acting is absolutely great. It should have won at  least one Academie Award (Sam Jackson as best supporting actor), but it  didn't. Then there is the great chemistry between Travolta and Jackson in  the first and last part. The terrific dialog (the &quot;you know what they  call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris&quot; is now a classic with  even the Cartoon Network copying it!)And ofcourse the story. A lotta people  don't get the story. But there's nothing 2 get. Some people say there's no  plot, but why does there always have 2 be a plot? This film stands out  because it don't follow a standard Hollywoord recipe!  And then there's the  soundtrack, which fits perfectly with the movie. So 4 everybody who hasn't  seen this movie jet, hurry up and rent it!	5.0	Best movie ever	2000-09-20	5	3	2
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3RJU10Z0LMIV	Thinker3	This film is vastly over-rated.  Tarantino must have been influenced by Elmore Leonard.  His (Tarantino's) crooks and thugs are supposed to be having serious discussions while they are committing various violent, gruesome criminal acts.  In Leonard's novels thi sort of thing is very funny, and I think Tarantino intends the film to be funny.  It isn't.  (Amazon wrongly lists it as a drama/thriller.) Try to think of &#34;Deliverance&#34; as a comedy and you get some idea of the challenge he faces.  It is not the gruesome subject or the writing that is the problem.  Ironically, I think it's his all-star cast.  They are all excellent actors, but they don't get the right tone for the material to really work.  Jackson, who often dominates scenes, takes himself and the material too seriously.  He should have been more stupid.  The wolf sequence could have been a riot if it were done with a different tone.  I surmise that a young Tarantino just couldn't bring himself to reign in his famous actors.  The one actor who I think did get it right is Maria de Medeiros.  She's terrific, but not even mentioned in Amazon's long list of supporting actors.	2.0	A Failed Comedy	2014-07-10	0	0	0

Unfortunately, this product has fallen victim to the common flaw of early Disney/Miramax DVD releases: you will  not get the best value for your money. This studio has already released a  VHS widescreen &quot;collector's edition&quot; that contains two deleted  scenes and Tarantino commentary. You will not find this material on the  DVD. Also, unlike other cult favorites released by Disney/Miramax (such as  CLERKS and SCREAM), you will not get director's commentary on a secondary  soundtrack. You will get the rudimentary DVD features--subtitles, scene  access, and other languages--but Disney/Miramax has not yet presented this  film in DVD packaging worthy of the devotion Tarantino's work has inspired  and the influence it still has. If I were to rate this DVD on the merits of  the film alone, I would say it deserves at least four and a half stars out  of five. Unfortunately, the packaging falls short of what it should be,  even what it could be with available material. Let's hope that  Disney/Miramax offers a better, more extras-rich DVD edition in the future.	4.0	Worthwhile Movie, Package of Compromised Value	2000-05-23	11	8	3

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1LZVU5SRRM3VX	Timothy Michael Resh	Had I writtent this review after the first time I watched this Tarantino splatter fest back in 1994, my rating would have been one star.  Apart from the unusual way in which Tarantino tied together and revealed the interaction of the stories out of chronological order, I saw nothing of even remote social redeeming value in the film.Having not seen other Tarantino flicks at the time, I did not understand that Tarantino's medium always involves extreme, stylized violence, the more outrageous the better.Whenever my reaction to such an iconic film is so intensely negative, I always try to revisit the film at a later time, as much to understand the root of the phenomenon as to make sure my initial perceptions weren't skewed.  In this case, I believe they were, by the gratuitous and graphic violence and strong language.  Upon re-viewing the film, I discovered some of the subtler moments of really good acting, particularly Samuel L. Jackson's final &quot;Ezekiel speech&quot; in the diner and Bruce Willis' uneasy reconciliation with Ving Rhames after their encounter in the pawn shop.  These moments alone make the investment of time in the whole, lurid journey worthwhile.While I was still utterly repulsed by Orlando Jones'character accidentally getting his grey matter spread across the interior of Jules' car, the perverse humor of this and other situations in the film were more amusing when considered in the context of what Tarantino was trying to present.  At first, I simply could not get past the combination of the temporal displacement of the exposition or initial shock value of the lurid subplots Tarantino's characters constantly found themselves in.Pulp Fiction is film that definitely benefits from multiple viewings--if you can stomach watching it more than once.	3.0	Benefits from Multiple Viewings	2004-01-20	3	1	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A138WG3QE2JS4F	Todd Gak	What can I say the Knoxville, TN native Quentin Tarantino is a complete genius. &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is arguably one of the best films ever made. For the first time watcher you may be slightly confused once the movie is over because of the way it skips around in the plot throughout the whole movie. I myself had to watch it a couple of times before I fully understood everything that was going on, and that was part of the beauty of this movie. Its just unexplainable on how great this movie is. It has great acting, great film shots, a superb script, great production and direction.&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; could be labled as a comedy, drama, gangster film, crime film, anything! This movie has a little bit of everything and would be perfect for anyone, unless of course you are offended by cussing, however I think that the overwelming cursing in this movie just makes it that much funnier. Great movie!! Its a MUST buy for all movie lovers. 5+++++ stars!!	5.0	Bring out the gimp	2002-08-04	12	5	7

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AV5G37VFE5NVD	Tom Benton	"*POSSIBLE SLIGHT SPOILERS WITHIN*Quentin Tarantino burst out of nowhere with 1992's RESERVOIR DOGS.  After wowing audiences and critics alike with that film, he took a two-year hiatus to make his next movie.  Then, in 1994, Tarantino unleashed upon the world PULP FICTION.  Though its budget was a measly $8,000,000, PULP FICTION wound up grossing nearly $108,000,000 in the U.S. alone.  It was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won one (Best Original Screenplay for Tarantino and his pal Roger Avary); it also took home the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival.None of these things, however, come close to really expressing how grand a film PULP FICTION is.  It is not only one of the absolute finest movies ever made; it is the pinnacle of great filmmaking.  Tarantino is infatuated with every aspect of filmmaking, and his love for the medium radiates from each and every image in this movie.  It takes more than infatuation to make a great film - it takes talent as well.  Thankfully, Tarantino is just as talented at moviemaking as he is infatuated with it.PULP FICTION is, more than anything, a throwback to the cheap old noir tales of the 50's.  Scenes which take place in vehicles use a purposefully old-fashioned and cheesy background projection.  The outstanding soundtrack is made up almost entirely of classic surfer music and 50's tunes, though there's also tunes from Dusty Springfield, Kool & The Gang, and Al Green.  The three stories which make up the bulk of the film are old-fashioned as well; they are certainly pulp fiction.The first of these stories stars John Travolta as hitman Vince Vega, who is assigned to take care of his boss' wife (played by Uma Thurman) while the boss is out of town.  Naturally, things don't go exactly as planned.  Vince begins to wonder if he's falling for Mia (the wife) - then she O.D.'s, and it's up to Vince to save her.  This leads to one of the film's best and most gruesome sequences.  Travolta is better than he's been in years, and Thurman is delightful as Mia.The second story revolves around boxer Butch, played by Bruce Willis.  Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) - Vincent's boss and the head of the local mob - fixes a boxing match and pays Butch to go down in the fifth round.  The problem is, Butch's pride gets the best of him, and rather than losing the match and retiring to the Caribbean he finds himself planning an escape with his girlfriend, Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros).  Again, things don't go as planned: Butch discovers that his watch, passed down from his great-grandfather to his grandfather to his father while each was at war, has been left at his apartment.  Willis is superb; there's great chemistry between he and Medeiros' character (whom is, by the way, irresistibly sweet and innocent).  Rhames seems invulnerable as the sinister Marsellus Wallace.  Also great is Christopher Walken, who opens the segment with a very amusing speech about the importance of Butch's watch.  The highlight of this segment is a sequence in which Butch, searching for a weapon, comes across a hammer.  He grips it, getting a feel for it - then he notices something else.  He picks it up and we see it's a baseball bat.  Again, he gets a feel for it, but he sets it down when he notices a chainsaw.  Just when it looks like he's satisfied, he looks up and his jaw drops.  Butch has discovered a beautiful samurai sword (which would have a far larger part in Tarantino's next masterpiece, 2003's KILL BILL: VOL. 1).In the third and final segment, Travolta returns as Vince, working with his partner, Jules (Samuel L. Jackson).  When Vince accidentally blows out someone's brain in the back of Jules' car (""Oh man,"" exclaims Travolta, ""I shot Marvin in the face!"") in the center of L.A. in broad daylight, the two hitmen take refuge in the home of Jimmy (played by Quentin Tarantino himself).  Jimmy's not very happy about having a corpse in his garage, and his wife is going to be home in an hour and a half.  So they call in ""The Wolf"" (Harvey Keitel), a smooth, super-cool guy who thinks he can solve the problem in no time.  This is arguably the finest segment, thanks to many laugh-out-loud moments.  Jackson gives the finest performance of his career, and Keitel seems as cool and confident as one can.  It's the perfect way to close the film.As with most of Tarantino's other films, PULP FICTION is told in non-linear fashion.  This is a very clever technique which makes the film twice as interesting.  Each of the stories interweave to create one big seamless masterpiece.  Tarantino's screenplay is truly wonderful and features some of the very best dialogue ever written.  In fact, Tarantino's screenplay is one of the best of all time: original, over-the-top, and darkly humorous.  I found myself struck also by the cinematography, which is truly excellent.  Each scene is captured from just about every possible angle.  It really spices up the film and helps keep you mesmerized for the entire 154-minute runtime.How can a film be this good?  There is no grand statement here, no deeper meaning - just three simple crime stories.  It's Tarantino's dedication that makes PULP FICTION so good.  The acting is superb, the editing seamless, the script outrageous and original, the soundtrack classic, the cinematography magnificent.  It's a masterpiece that is undoubtedly one of the ten best films ever made - it may even be number one.  The rave reviews, the awards, the fans, these things cannot give one the slightest idea of how truly outstanding PULP FICTION really is.  If you have not seen it, then you musn't hesitate to rush out to the nearest video store and watch it.  It's a move that no true moviegoer will regret."	5.0	The pinnacle of filmmaking	2006-05-20	7	5	2

I'm older now and I'm still not into the profanity, or the Dungeon/Zed scene, but I can now appreciate the comedy blended into this ""Die Hard""-""Desperado""-""Men in Black"" film. It took me a little while to figure out how all these stories fit together. It's not like most movies where it's a single pattern from beginning to middle to end. This shindig takes you between the lines and further between the lines. My favorite part is the Ezekiel 29:17 speech with Sam Jackson. The way he says it, he might as well be a preacher reformed hitman; he used to be a preacher now he's a hitman.If you enjoyed Reservoir Dogs, Desperado, One Upon a Time in Mexico, From Dusk Till Dawn- the original, not the other ones, you're more than likely to get swept up in the bloody mess of Pulp Fiction.

It's packed with tons of great extras, my favorite being that of the charlie rose interview.  Which features a young Quentin talking about influences and how he got his movies made and stuff like that.  The movie is made even more amazing with great sound and picture.  To me there is no better movie than this movie.  It's funny, sick, demented, philosophical, witty, intense and is probably the best film of the nineties.  I take that back, most definately is the best film of the nineties.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2UNMXBJSVIXFB	Tony Khamvongsouk	"Movie - 5.0The first time I saw this I was like, 12 years old, and it was on VHS. It looked cool at the time, but my teenage brain couldn't handle anything past the loud voices and constant cussing, but kudos for style points. The second time I saw it (maybe another 12 years after the first) I believe it was supposed to be a DVD rip, but the sound encoding was atrocious, so I only enjoyed it in part. The the third time I saw it (about 3 months ago) was off of Netflix streaming with decent enough audio, but not so great video. Ironically enough, the one time I finally get to see and hear the darn thing with quality A/V is on Blu-ray. That being said, it should go without question by user vote on IMDb, critic appraisal, or any number of awards and accolades given to this film that Pulp Fiction has cemented itself as a true game-changer in the halls of cinema legend. Be it the achronological storytelling, the sassy script, the dark humor, the quirky characters, or just the amazing level of star power involved from every which way, there's a lot to like about this film. For me, personally, it's the method. I don't mean the cut-up timeline (which is enjoyable in itself and keeps you on your toes), but how so much of the dialogue is ""just there"" from a purely jovial or character-developing perspective. Talks of Amsterdam and their legalization of drugs, the differences between European and American culture, the frivolous comparison between a foot massage and going down on a girl, the significantly comedic monologue of a P.O.W. storing his best friend's watch up his anus for years only to deliver it to his son, and all kinds of other seemingly random stuff ""capped off"" by a stride at redemption would make you think otherwise about this being nominated for seven Oscars, right? Well, as most people often say about Quentin Tarantino films, ""you should just see it for yourself to know what I mean."" And the result after almost 20 years? It's a part of our modern day pop culture with all kinds of quotable lines, a beacon of entertainment and inspiration within the industry,and, for all intents and purposes, one really fun movie to watch. Is it for everyone? Of course not. But most would say it is.Video - 5.0- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC- Video resolution: 1080p- Aspect ratio: 2.35:1- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1The front and back of the slipcover and the back of the cover art says that this transfer was supervised by Quentin Tarantino himself and even has a copy of his signature on the slip, so what you see here was what the director intended. And I have to say, after 3 very poor video outings (VHS, a crappy DVD rip, and Netflix streaming), I have to say I've never seen the movie look this good (literally). The production budget was only $8 million, which by today's standards would still only be about $12 million. But wow, am I glad Tarantino used some quality film stock. First and foremost, I have to commend the black levels. All the tiny little details, linings, reflections, and textures look absolutely pristine on this presentation. Particularly, the wetness of Jules' Jheri curl, as laughable as the look is intended to be, adds a nice aesthetic sense of throwback to the Blaxploitation genre that Mr. Jackson's character is portraying. And then you have the hallmark scene where Vincent is taking Mia to Jack Rabbit Slim's, which is FULL of dark lighting, and yet still manages to display an amazing amount of detail around the restaurant itself, its patrons, on Thurman's hair, and in Travolta's suit in addition to the smoke he's blowing. Colors, while somewhat muted from an art direction standpoint, are surprisingly bold. The scene where Butch is taking money from Marsellus in the bar is full of red light, but in comparison to other brightly red-lit backdrops (which isn't many), I'm pleased at how a lot of the detail still remained intact. Then, of course, is the blood. Maybe it was more so the stuff they used to be the blood, but when it splatters, it looks great. Not real per se, but it's one of those artistic subtleties that Tarantino does well in his films. I am also happy to report that there is very little, if any, hints of dirt or artifacting. There's a fine layer of grain (and I mean very fine), but it doesn't seem like any DNR was added. Edge Enhancement? Not too sure, I'm typing this review with only 4 hours of sleep and might've seen a tiny little bit, but it's hard to say when I'm not all there. Regardless, though, I can tell you everything else looks superb, especially for its age.Audio - 5.0Languages- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1Subtitles- English, English SDH, SpanishAnother big part of Tarantino's films outside of its aesthetic and literary homages is the sound, particularly the music. As soon as Surf Rider starts playing it's easy to tell that this DTS-HD MA 5.1 track will do its job and do it well. LFEs are at their most prominent when any of this great soundtrack starts playing. Even as the radio switches to Jungle Boogie in the opening sequence, there's not a discrepancy to be heard. But how do the rest of the sound elements hold up on this seemingly quaint sound design? I mean, how can 230 pages of script possibly earn a 5 point rating? Oddly enough, this film's sound scape has a LOT of immersion. Shortly after the credits have done their thing we get a great audio treat in the first scene where Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are contemplating their change in venue for an upcoming robbery. I actually wouldn't even know this if I hadn't accessed all the extras, but the trivia track says that even in this very first scene, despite the achoronlogical plot structure, if you listen hard enough during Pumpkin and Honey Bunny's conversation you can distinctly hear Jules talking to Vincent in the background from a scene to be shown later on in the film. How cool is that? And while the weak point of the sound effects may be in the meager gunshots, the sheer sense of engulfment that every other crowded scene has to offer is sonic gold. Directionality and separation sound wonderful during these parts putting you right there in the thick of things. Meanwhile, high and low ends still manage to be very well-calibrated, specifically in the scene where Mia is getting her adrenaline shot between all the paper raffling around and the eventual thump on her chest. Oh yeah, and the dialogue couldn't be any clearer. From Jules' intimidating preacher vibrato to Fabienne's sweet and sexy accented-English, the movie has never looked OR sounded better. My favorite scenes to test the audio would be the aforementioned robbery attempt at the beginning of the film and the always-exalting trademark scene of Vincent and Mia going to Jack Rabbit Slim's (when they walk to their table and when they start dancing).Extras - 5.0Wow, I should really have taken a nap before work instead of trying to rush this review out for everyone to get a fresh take on the product, but I'm glad I at least got to learn a lot of things despite my soon-to-be headache at the crap hole at which I work. At any rate, this BD is loaded with extras. Most of them are DVD ports, but I'd never seen this on DVD anyway, and thus, am just seeing all of this for the very first time.- Not the Usual Mindless Boring Getting to Know You Chit Chat (HD; 43:01)A new HD retrospective with most of the film's actors discussing how they were cast, how the shooting went, and all of the things that ensued after the film came out. There's a lot of information here about the movie itself, its writing, and how a lot of the actors felt working with Tarantino.- Here are Some Facts on the Fiction (HD; 20:37)Another newly-produced featurette that shows a roundtable discussion with critics and their thoughts on how Pulp Fiction has affected the industry, their favorite parts, and some of the things that make the movie so good.- Pulp Fiction: The Facts - Documentary (SD; 30:31)Is from the Special Edition DVD (as is everything else from here on out) and is something of a mishmash of the pre-production, filming, and reception of the movie up to 2001.- Deleted Scenes (SD; 24:30)Feature commentary for 4 out of the 5 scenes by Tarantino and are enjoyable, if you want to at least take a one-time look.- Siskel & Ebert At the Movies: The Tarantino Generation (SD; 16:00)Is a short look at the quick rise of Tarantino's status and whether or not they think he was legit at the time. It comes off rather pretentious, though, so I wouldn't recommend it.- Charlie Rose Show (SD; 55:27)Features a GREAT interview with Tarantino and discusses a lot of his film-making roots, his philosophy as a movie-lover, and what he believes makes a good film.- Independent Spirit Awards (SD; 11:29)- Cannes Film Festival - Palme D'Or Acceptance Speech (SD; 5:20)- Marketing Gallery (SD; 16:13)Lots and lots of trailers/teasers.- Still Gallery- Enhanced Trivia TrackA trivia track that pops up all sorts of tidbits of information in the subtitles telling you all the quirks about the film itself, if any of you like that sort of thing (and some of it being very funny).Overall - 5.0As fervid as my review sounds, I'm actually not that big a fan of Tarantino. Aside from seeing this and Inglorious Basterds more than two times each, I've only seen his other films once. I didn't really get into Reservoir Dogs and the Kill Bills were stylish enough, but keep in mind it's been nearly five years since I've seen those, and five years is a lot of time for my brain to better develop. But to the point, yes, Pulp Fiction is definitely one of those films that somehow managed to turn a bunch of dialogue into a fun and raucous movie. It's well-written, especially well-acted, and is a good way to spend two and a half-hours. With top-notch A/V quality and over 3 hours of specials, an SRP of $19.99 is practically nothing for such an renowned title that finally made its way to a proper BD release."	5.0	Pulp Fiction (Blu-ray)	2011-10-05	164	143	21

This movie is, without a doubt, the best movie I have ever seen in my life.John Travolta and Samuel L are both hit men.  It starts off with them attempting to do a job, and running into a lot of trouble.  The chemistry between Jackson and Travolta is unbelievable.Then, we have Bruce Willis, an over the hill boxer being tempted to throw a fight.  Inevitably, he ends up with a tough bookie out for his blood!Basically, the movie is a bunch of short stories, all of them related.  A LOT of drug use, graphic violence, and sex.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2J0VNTQTQO4R4	ToonForever	"Well, I think some reviewers are just jealous, or have an inferiority complex and compensate by projecting a false sense of superiority.Or maybe they just don't get it.I have to say, I avoided Pulp Fiction for four years.  It seemed overhyped, Quentin this and Tarantino that.  Plus I'm not a big fan of movie violence.  But when I started screenwriting I thought, well, I should make sure I watch all sorts of movies, especially the ones the industry loves.  I might learn something.I popped in Pulp Fiction thinking that I'd have something to say similar to, oh, soupy peggy, perhaps.Wrong.  Wrongo.  Wrongowrongwrongo.This movie is a stunning tour-de-force.  When Vincent and Jules sauntered out of the restaurant I was worn out and exhilarated all at once.  I finally understood why everyone was going ape over this flick.The timeline isn't jumbled, it's more of a gradual revelation.  In fact, it would be more truthful to say that the timeline is internal to the characters rather than to the actual events.  QT puts things in their proper order to reveal these fantastic, fascinating characters, with the catalyitic events of their intersecting lives displayed when needed, so in the end you know why these wild people do what they do and end up where they end up.The sequence is subservient to the dialogue, and, as another reviewer pointed out, it forces you to listen to some of the most brilliant dialogue in cinema, hands down.Mix that with some absolutely classic gags... Pop Tart, anyone?  Or perhaps an adrenaline shot to the heart?Anybody focusing on the violence, or missing the downright wholesome message underneath the ""youthful angst"" or whatever the heck our shallower reviewers called it, is depriving themselves of one of the most important cinematic viewing events of the last 50 years.Buy this now.  Watch it once.  Think about it.  When you feel like watching it again, wait.  Then wait a little longer.  When you think you can't wait any longer, do so anyway.  Then when you finally watch it again, you will be keyed up enough to take in all the little things you missed the first time around.Whatever you do, though, don't dismiss this.  Even if the violence keeps you at one viewing only, you won't ever forget what you've seen."	5.0	Like an Onion...	2006-01-12	18	13	5

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	ADZIJQN6MNRAB	TRFB	"The movie itself deserve 5 stars.  The features deserve 0!!!Whoever said this DVD has tons of them really doesn't get out much. But, if you like hearing about the director and how innovative he is and how he brought the movie to life, and all that self abasing stuff, well then yeah, this DVD is full of them!!  I didn't realize how stuck on himself the Tarantino is.  He has a bunch of the actors talking about how great a director he is and how he approached the making of the movie, but I came away with the same questions about the movie as I did when I watched the Special Features.  The deleted scenes, were so-so.  What I hoped to learn about the movie was his concept in detail.  Sure he goes over it, but really goes back to talking about himself.  I wanted to learn about the briefcase and what it represented, and learn about each of the characters themselves not the director!!!Well, I'm not really big on ""Special Features"" so I could care less, but for those who are going to buy this just for the special features, well, you'll be disappointed.  Just buy a autobiography about Qentin Tarantino, I'm sure one exists and if not, I'm sure he'll put one out.- Out"	4.0	Great movie.  Special Features terrible!!	2005-06-13	1	1	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	AEBZVNKHJNJHU	"T. SIMPSON ""amazon man"""	The transfer looks awesome on this DVD and the extras are above average.  The Charlie Rose interview is a classic.  The story is such an absurd collection of movie cliches, weird situations, and fresh dialog spliced together with captivating editing that you can't help but loving it.  It comes across as a film composed of all the scenes that should have been edited out while making a normal film.  The long takes of characters actually passing time.  The bizzare situations they get into.  No film should actually have those scenes; they should have been edited out for the actual movie because they're too weird.  It seems so totally original and holds up well after many viewings.  May be too intense for some because of the violence.  Although, most of the violence is implied or just seen through its results, albeit graphically and humurously.  See it if you haven't already.	5.0	Great movie and DVD features	2002-10-15	1	1	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	ADWXHFACSKDS8	TV	A good film usually expresses its story visually.  It shows us the story.  Not this one.  Pulp Fiction is a rich circular story about around gangsters, criminals, and a mysterious briefcase. In this story, Tarantino boldly breaks the rules of screenwriting, delivering a film where the dialogue drives the story.  Good dialogue seems organic and almost conversational, yet express a deep rich subtext. Take for instance, Vincent and Jules' conversation before they carry out a hit.  They discuss drugs in Amsterdam and how their boss supposedly threw a guy out the window for giving his wife a foot massage. The dialogue seems random and unrelated to the plot--almost like everyday conversation.  Yet this shows Tarantino's masterful writing skills, because he is able to pack so much weight in dialogue without seeming to do so.  Vincent later later on takes out his boss' wife on a date on the boss' order, and she almost overdoses on heroin.  Now, what is in the audience's is what would happen to him if he brings her back dead; if some guy got thrown out a window for massaging her foot, what worse will happen to him?  Tarantino puts his characters in dire and serious situations, but he always finds dark humor in these circumstances.  Do you think you would ever laugh at someone's brains getting blown out?  The movie combines a very ironic mix of violence and humor throughout that takes you on a thrilling experience.  The unconventional structure of the story adds another twist, with interrelated scenes that add more context to each other.  It does not depend on action or special effects to catch the attention of its viewer.  The ensemble cast, including John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, bring their characters to life.  Pulp Fiction's creativity in juggling all these aspects creates a movie that is pure pleasure to watch and be dazzled by.  It is for an audience that dares a movie to break all conventions, just as its characters defy all the rules.	5.0	A Modern Classic	2009-11-16	0	0	0

Instead, I want to review this collector's edition of the DVD itself. First, the packaging and design are really cool. The 2 disc set is inside a clear digi pak that folds up and slides into a die cut slipcase, revealing only Uma's face. The digi pak itself is made of high quality UV coated heavy stock paper. Quentin added a little something extra inside the package that I thought was cool, it's a Jack Rabbit Slim's menu...nice touch! Now, the movie is on disc one, and disc two is devoted to extra bonus material. The 2 stand out features on disc 2 are an episode of the Charlie Rose show where Quentin was the guest for a full hour! This is the best and most insightful interview I've seen Quentin give (that's thanks to Charlie). He talks about all the little details that led him to become a film maker and what inspires his unique vision. Also, is a full program of At the Movies, that discusses Quentin's influence on today's film scene. Both these programs were one time airings, so if you missed them, this is the only way to see them.The extras make this a flawless DVD release and truly worthy of the name ""collector's edition""."	5.0	All about the Extras!	2005-03-21	1	1	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3FROIVO3OGOTF	Victor M. Sanchez II	Pulp Fiction is a very good movie. It has an unmatchable group of stars. Tarantino and another great production. This movie is as good as Kill Bill. The way the story is blended together is majestic. It might be confusing at some points because the story is not in order. It does not follow a pattern. And that's what makes it very creative and interesting. The story takes you to the past and then back to the present and so on. So, the events are not in chronological order. Very cunning. Excellent performances by Travolta, Willis, Jackson, Thurman and all the cast. I bought the widescreen theatrical version with aspect ratio 2.35:1 and I would recommend to get the full screen version if possible. Not that it interferes with the picture, but I always prefer to have full screen and be able to see everything centered and with symmetry. The movie is in English but you can also watch it in Spanish. It has English subtitles.	5.0	Very Creative...	2013-04-18	0	0	0

Ever wondered why Marseulles Wallace has a band-aid at the back of his head?  There are answers to those questions and plenty of others ...

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3LQ6XMR25MRJ9	"Vlad Cuellar ""vlad"""	"Quentin Tarantino films are like Elvis and the Beatles. They are accepted as being ""great"", therefore everyone and their mom says they are great simply because everyone else says so. However I am a film buff who will not classify any movie as being ""great"" until I have viewed it many times and have been entertained by it as many times. I can safely say that Pulp Fiction is NOT a great movie not by far. Fair to good is my rating. Now I'll break down my reasons. First off, the opening of Pulp Fiction is like Reservior Dogs it starts with a lengthy(very)speech between two characters. These two being a Brtish couple who have decided to rob a restaurant. Now that's pretty weird, when was the last time you saw a white British couple rob an American restaurant?! Ok I can overlook that but the opening is a turnoff for anyone expecting a believable violent movie. The movie then introduces us to two hit men Jules and Vincent played by Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta. Their dialogue and adventures are the high point of the movie. Jackson in particular is great as the logical and somewhat spiritual killer. But once again the casting is so illogical and unbelievable. Jules and Vincent are sent to do a job in the beginning of the movie for mob boss Marsellus Wallace. But their target is this wimpy nerdy white guy with a part in his hair who cries when things get tough. How could this weepy wimp be involved with the mob?? But the worst casting in this movie has to be Bruce Willis. Now I have never liked WIllis, to me he has always seemed like a bald talentless ugly actor who acquired fame and fortune due to his longtime marriage with Demi Moore. In Pulp Fiction, Tarantino casts Willis as a boxer who betrays the mob and kills another boxer in a fight that was suppossed to be fixed. Never mind the fact that Willis doesn't even look like an athlete and is on the wrong side of 40! Completely unbelievable. I'm just glad that we never got to see Willis in the ring or then this really would've turned into a joke. Worse than Willis is the actress who plays his girlfriend. The dialogue written for this woman sounds downright retarded. She wishes she had a 'pot belly'? Uh like why? Awful, unnecessary and downright idiotic dialogue. These characters intersect one day as Willis and Marsellus are captured by some redneck rapists. Willis escapes and since he helps Marsellus, the mob boss forgives Willis for not taking the dive. Also at the end, Jules and Vincent come into the very restaurant that is being robbed by the British couple. Jules talks them out of the robbery and decides to give up being a hitman. In conclusion there are some pretty good ideas here. But the casting is very weak and in some parts the dialogue is simply too wordy and superlous. Also this movie does not age well. It's only ten years old yet it feels incredibly dated. Pulp Fiction is an example of the power of marketing and advertising. Quentin Tarantino had the right connections at the right time, the right publicist and the right people behind him. It is the power of advertising that chooses to call this movie great. The movie by itself is not great not by a long shot. If you are looking for  truly great violent movies check out films like ""Leon"" and ""La Femme Nikita""."	2.0	Vastly almost criminally overrated	2005-12-27	28	7	21

The success of this film can only encourage the Govt. and Madison avenue to stay on course, that is, continue to provide nothing of quality but to dress it up in ""cool"" packaging.  Why shouldn't they after reading these reviews?As for the film, Tarantino is a Hack.  Where to begin?  For the sake of brevity, nearly all of this film is lifted from something or someone much better than Tarantino.  The film is vacuous, the  screenplay vapid, and the acting is almost entirely done by the local chapter of Scenery Chewers Anonymous.  In fact, this film makes anything by M. Knight actually seem weighty by contrast and he sits at the head of Gimmick Guild of Hollywood's Board IMO.  My advice is to research the sources for Quentin's ripoffs as there is much more enrichment in those places than here.  He's not completely without talent by any means though.

I needed to find out what all the hype was about. What a terrible disappointment.I actually saw this film a couple of years ago, so much of the detail of the film has blissfully receded into the recesses of my memory. Unfortunately, what remains is the revulsion I felt when it was over. I do not pretend to be a student of filmmaking, but as another reviewer has stated here, ""I know what I like and I know what I don't like."" This, I definitely didn't like.I found this film to be nothing more than an overlong vehicle for violence and profanity in the extreme. It's not that I morally object to bloodshed and profanity in the context of a movie if there is a point to it and if, at the end of the day, the movie entertains. This film didn't.Someone here said that one needs to see this movie at least twice to appreciate it. It took a tremendous act of will on my part to see it through to the end the first time around (always hoping until the credits appeared that something, ANYTHING, would happen that would make me feel the time was well spent-nothing did). I can't bear the thought of watching it again in the hope that I will finally see a point to anything this film had to offer.Although I'm obviously in the minority here, I'm afraid this is one flick I'll force myself to stay away from, no matter what other critics think.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A2ASIT0JYIGHTA	William	People call this movie garbage.  On first viewing, it may be difficult to understand what a fine film it is.  I first saw it in 1994 and didn't really like it then.  Now I love it.I urge those who are unsure to watch it again, and let it just sink in.  How can you not enjoy those fantastic scenes which have a high re-watch factor - ie. the restaurant scene with Travolta and Thurman, and the breakfast scene where Jackson shoots the tenants. These are just two examples!DVD SUMMARY:Released countless times on DVD, this 2 Disc collector's edition offers more special features than earlier releases.  What I still find odd is that the film quality is still disappointing.  Apparently the original source has problems that can't be fixed.  It's not a huge problem, but there still remains scenes which are not as sharp as they should be for a film that is under 10 years old.  I've seen older films with pristine transfers.	4.0	Just let it unfold ...	2003-11-23	5	3	2

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A23IOPI0D1OG7V	"WILLIE A YOUNG II ""willow"""	Let me start by saying that Samuel L. Jackson was robbed at the Oscars! His stunning portrayal of Jules Winfield is so indelible and convincing that you actually forget that you're watching an ACTOR. While I can't praise the brilliance of this film enough, it surprises me that the last decade (filled with imitators and knock-offs) has done nothing to dilute the power and vibrance of this totally original cinematic experience. Quentin Tarantino writes the best dialogue in modern film (Jackson himself said that 'he writes things that actors want to say') and the way he twists time and events to tell the story is unparalleled.While many have complained about the graphic violence, language (particularly his liberal use of the 'N' word) and the offhanded way he deals with drug use and criminal activity, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; stands as a masterwork of modern fimmaking because it doesn't make these things the center of the film, it's the way his characters REACT to the goings on around them.A Masterpiece.	5.0	Brilliant.	2002-01-19	0	0	0

This is  his best, in my opinion. No trouble suspending disbelief despite the stars that populate this movie.  (Steve Buscemi as a waiter is so under the radar, you only recognize him by his voice!) Travolta and Jackson, Uma, Roth and Plummer - all delightful.  Willis was great in the pawn shop scenes, but in the fight and motel scenes, not so much.  However, the mute exchange between Travolta and Willis as Travolta exits the bathroom, was worth the price of admission.  All the episodes were entrancing, but when I recall this movie, I first remember the Diner sequence - Samual L. Jackson never did finish that muffin!	5.0	All time great movie!	2013-10-05	0	0	0

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1FT7QFKNHL9DT	Wolfe Moffat	I can't believe all these people think that Quentin Tarantino is some kind of genius. You'd have to be a retard to like have the crap he puts out on film, and trust me, there are a lot of retards out there. This movie gets 2 stars for only 1 reason, Samuel L. Jackson. And NO, this isn't his best movie either. And it really shouldn't get even 2 stars, because I can't STAND John Travolta! Now, if this IS your idea of a classic genius work, I hate to discourage anyone, but you have been PLAYED, and you've spent your $$ on no real talent! Hear that? NO TALENT!!! N-O T-A-L-E-N-T !-!-! My favorite Tarantino movie out there is Jackie Brown, because it has to be one of the best player movies out there... AND I HATED IT TOO!!!

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A3O536E2YOKK4Y	Wuchak	"I was 20 years late, but I finally watched Quentin Tarantino's popular ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) and was impressed.The film's a drama/thriller/black comedy about two hit men in Los Angeles (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), their mob boss & his wife (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a boxer who incurs the wrath of the boss (Bruce Willis).The tale's told in a non-linear fashion, but it's easy to follow and the final act ties everything up nicely. The dialogue's witty and the story maintains your attention, despite its 2 hour and 34 minutes runtime. The film's stylish and pulsates with energy and innovation; it understandably influenced many late-90's films and beyond.The reason I unconsciously put off seeing it for so long was the fact that the protagonists are all big city gangsters or somehow involved with 'em. These are lawless people who would kill a person without batting an eye. Their god is money or hedonism. Let 'em shoot each other to smithereens for all I care. But if you can look beyond this, the film's worth your time. What redeems it for me -- besides the entertaining movie-making -- is that it's a tale of redemption and the high price of dullard non-repentance, and much more.Both Travolta and, especially, Jackson shine. And there are a lot other celebrities, like Harvey Keitel, many in cameos, like curvy Julia Sweeney.BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a quirky crime drama/thriller you can't go wrong with ""Pulp Fiction."" It's top-of-the-line in every way, including the subtext.GRADE: A"	5.0	The cream of the crop of quirky crime thrillers	2014-04-03	0	0	0
1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A1Q15TP2FXYYMF	"www.steveo2006.co.uk ""Steveo"""	...I guess, in that you either love it or hate. That may be a cliche, and of course it is, but in fact that is the reason why Pulp Fiction is so great. It takes a series of worn out ideas, actors and cliches and transposes them into another form of pop culture. Indeed this film is just another product of pop culture, which has now become as iconic as an Andy Warhol print or the ubiquitous Macdonalds and Burger Kings. Instead of shunning its contemporaries Pulp Fiction wears them well; frequent scenes are based around fast food restauraunts or the effects of modern narcotics. Yet, unlike those fleeting pop institutions there is a timelessness about Pulp Fiction. There are so many reasons why it is so great, and as a work of cinematographic art it stands amongst the best of them.Pulp Fiction is a snapshot of American gangster life, classy and crisp. It is more three intertwining chapters than one whole story. The first is the story of Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L Jackson), two gangsters sent to retrieve a mysterious briefcase, the second the tale of a marked boxer (Bruce Willis) the third the conclusion of the first. Confused? You will be! But then again the plot, although intelligent, never purports to being the crucial element of the film.The film's best moments are the individual scenes; Jackson reciting Ezekiel before assassinating his targets, Mia (Uma Thurmann) overdosing on heroin, Marcellus being tortured. Contrary to what a lot of people believe, this film isn't actually very frenetic or violent. Much of the time is spent in inane conversations about restauraunts or relationships and this stasis makes the violence seem that much more absurd. This film isn't about realism, it is about surreality. Tarentino portrays life in a gritty, grim way, but in a surreal way nonetheless. How else could you have a scene where two hired assassins are forced to scrub out brains from the back of their car?Why is it a piece of art, rather than a simple film? Well, unlike ordinary films there is little chronological order, little coherence and finally, little conclusion. The final scene (but not chronologically) ends with two characters strutting out the door, one of whom has been killed earlier and the other of whom has earlier resigned. Plot lines are never tied up fully; what happens to the boxer, what happens to Mia etc etc. Yet this adds to the atmosphere; it is simply a brief snapshot into a world that has these consistent going ons. The film is very strong visually and also has a superb soundtrack. Tarentino uses forgotten classics like an old Al Green tune or another soul standard to enhance the mood, to make the scenes more elegant. In this respect it's much like Tarentino's most recent project, Kill Bill except instead of western style music it's surf guitars and pop songs.But then again, if it's a piece of art why buy it? Why not buy a standard film? Here's why;1) It's intriguing, thrilling and intelligent2) It contains so many iconic scenes (Travolta dancing etc)3) It set the tone for so many films after it4) The cast is superb - Travolta, Thurmann, Jackson, Roth5) It has a brief cameo by Tarentino himself6) Everyone else has seen it7) Everyone else has bought itSo, to go back to my earlier point you either love it or you hate it; love it for being an aesthetically pleasing art-piece, hate it for its arty pretensions, love it for the intelligent, thought provoking plot, hate it for leaving the plot hanging.Personally, it blew me away; witty incisive dialogue, crisp production, cool style. One of the greatest films of all time - as Jackson says; 'Mmmm, that is good!'	5.0	A Bit Like Marmite...	2006-06-25	4	3	1

Tarantino puts together all the pieces of  the puzzle at the end.

1558908242	Pulp Fiction	A11PUCIGJ4OHUD	Zachary	A movie that just seems to be meaning less violence and a collection of random scenes turns into a continuous story with many arguments and messages hidden behind all the violence. Without the messages and symbolism you get a great new age gangster movie set in drug addicted 80's Los Angeles. Great acting and directing makes even the most trivial side characters memorable and important. But then you can crack into the meat of the movie, looking past the initial shock and digging deeper to find all of the underlying plots, the true conflicts the film sets up. This movie is very violent and thus not for the younger ones, or the easily upset, but this is a film that entertains and changes on each viewing.	5.0	Great movie, highly recomended	2014-02-25	0	0	0

I still love the acting, Samuel L. Jackson shines and this is one of his best roles in a film.  The only part I wish they skipped was the rape scene.  I hate it everytime I have to watch it to follow the story.  The should have cut out the physical act of Ving Rhames being raped, don't need to see that homeboy!
