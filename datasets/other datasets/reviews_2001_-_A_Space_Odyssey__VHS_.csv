6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A319PM1MXFDS03	#1 D.C. fan Gene (GeneleeX@aol.com)	2001 is one of the best movies out there.  Yes it is slow.  Yes the dialogue takes up only a fraction of the entire movie.  The reason why this movie is so good is because it makes you think- it's a lot like reading a  book.  There's a lot of symbolism and meaning, and if all you're looking  for is plot, you'll be sorely disappointed.  If you don't like to think,  then this movie is not for you.If the movie confuses you, read the book  and then try watching it again.	5.0	Great movie if you have a brain and like to use it	1999-07-25	1	1	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1ALOIPRR8Q06J	"2 cents ""meaningless memes"""	"Please permit me to ramble for a moment. Or skip to my 2001 review/analysis recommendations ---YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS THIS STUFF.I feel like being a dork. And I know I ain't tellin' ya anything you probably don't already know. 2001 is boring? Most boring movie ever? See the review below or a recent skit from the usually hilarious ""Robot Chicken"" show late at night on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim lineup.To some viewers -of all ages- it is boring. Typically people that already don't like science fiction, movies without a lot of ""action"", and/or that have an aversion to ambiguity and being in any way challenged by a movie.But obviously more people born in the 1980s and after do have a problem appreciating this classic because they have grown-up in a media environment in which mind blowing special effects are taken for granted. An era (it needs repeating) that came about due in part to the groundbreaking work done in making 2001. Before 2001 movies did not have good ""special"" effects (arguably a couple or so minor exceptions). Kids today have been raised on a steady diet of video games and Hollywood films in which speed and action are taken as necessities and continually evolving and supposedly improving graphics and eye dazzling imagery are completely expected. Supposedly better because for the most part the look of 2001's ships, space stations and costumes, while perhaps in some regards is aesthetically dated, do look better, more real, more realistic and more probable. Just compare 2001 to the cgi showcase that was the Star Wars prequel world of George Lucas. It isn't surprising that when you hear Lucas talk it is usually about the cost effectiveness of his digital Baroque Nerdism. (That term was coined in a hysterical review from the Village Voice titled ""May the Force Be Over"". I recommend it.) The media world younger generations are coming out of has left them with very short attention spans (even more than my generation!) and overstimulated senses to the point that the mind is dulled.Nothing will change this. But maybe some historical context and some interesting analysis would help. You have to care in the first place, BUT to those that maybe care to appreciate this movie instead of bash it, I got a couple of supplemental reading and video presentation suggestions.*************Much has been written about genius Stanley Kubrick's groundbreaking masterpiece. I want use this space on Amazon to share some recent discoveries of mine. If I were a fan or if had never heard anything about this movie I would appreciate checking out this stuff. So this is in the spirit of making this ""review"" useful or helpful to Amazon customers, but I have nothing original or interesting to say myself. People much smarter or more interesting than me -and who have dedicated more time than I ever could- have analyzed this movie as much as movie can be analyzed. And some have probably gone a little too far....but that's for YOU to decide. You'll probably at least enjoy the ride. It gets pretty ""out there"". More than you'd ever believe.---Read Rob Ager's analysis: ""'Kubrick: and beyond the cinema frame' An in-depth analysis of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY"". And then watch the incredible video version of the review on his site, ""Collative Learning"", or You Tube.---Then check out ""2001: A False Flag Odyssey"" by Joe Bisdon. There's a link to it on Ager's site.---And of course worth going to is ""The Kubrick Site"". Lots of articles on Kubrick films...---You know what? Wikipedia is great. Lol. It's often criticized as unreliable source of information but it's usually worth checking out. In any case, the entry on 2001 is loaded with interesting tidbits on the making of the film and the fascinating development of what story to tell and how to tell it, as well it's reception and unique cultural impact. Plus you'll find ""External links"".Like stated above, there is just a ton off great stuff out there, but Ager's work kept me busy for a awhile and added even more to my experience of a film that I have loved so much over the years. Hope you enjoy it as much as me!!In the end I value this film not because of some secret meaning perhaps embedded within it or as an interesting puzzle to be solved, or because of it's important place in cinematic and cultural history, but rather because it triumphantly does for me what it's creator exactly intended. And I can't think of the medium of film going beyond the achievement of this type of experience for the viewer.""They are the areas I prefer not to discuss, because they are highly subjective and will differ from viewer to viewer. In this sense, the film becomes anything the viewer sees in it. If the film stirs the emotions and penetrates the subconscious of the viewer, if it stimulates, however inchoately, his mythological and religious yearnings and impulses, then it has succeeded"". -Stanley Kubrick"	5.0	NOT boring, if you can pay attention: Appreciating 2001 - A Space Odyssey	2009-07-12	15	9	6

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1NOLEWY3EBW01	683	"Many think that ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) is one of the greatest films of all time, and even some think that it's the greatest, and I can say that this Stanley Kubrick masterpiece is one of my favorite films of all time! Everything in this film is absolutely beautiful. The stunning visuals, the harrowing plot, the haunting music, the lush cinematography, the beautiful directing by none other than Kubrick. ""2001"" is way more than a film. It's a cinema masterpiece like no other, just like Kubrick's other films, like ""A Clockwork Orange"", or ""The Shining"". This film is simply one of the greatest. The thing about ""2001"" is some think it's one of the best, and some think it's one of the worst (although very few, and I don't know why they would hate it so much), but the reason that they hate it is for it's slow pace and that there's only about 40 minutes of dialouge in a 2 1/2 hour movie, but the scenes without dialouge, with slow pace really show the beauty of the film, and only Kubrick could have made each and every scene a masterpiece. If you see it for the first time, you might not like it, but the second or third time you see it, you'll most likely be blown away by the beauty (although in just my first viewing, I absolutely loved it). ""2001"" is an epic sci-fi that questions life on other planets and human destiny, that apparently gets affected whenever a striking black monolith appears. You may not understand this film fully the first time, but the beauty of Kubrick's films is that it takes a few viewings to understand Kubrick's message, and it's amazing.""2001"" is broken down into four sections, ""The Dawn of Man"" where it shows what the title suggests. It shows ape-like humans who learn to fend for themselves. It's about 20 minutes. ""TMA-1"" shows a Pan-Am space plane orbiting Earth. It focuses on Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) going over plans for a trip to Clavius Base, which is on the moon, with a large number of other members to the very futuristic ship. It's about 35-40 minutes ""Jupiter Mission: 18 Months Later"" shows spaceship Discovery One, with 2 members, Dr. David Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), and 3 other members in hibernation. On that ship is a very intelligent computer named HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain), who eventually wreaks havoc to the ship. It's about 55 min.-1 hour long. Finally, ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite"" shows Dr. Bowman's psychadelic and frightening trip through space, which includes the ""Stargate sequence"", showing flashing lights moving forward for a few minutes, following the next few minutes of cosmic phenomena and strange landscapes that actually kind of creeped me out (I saw this film in the dark), leading to the ending. It's about 25 minutes, leading the film to 2 hours and 28 minutes, including the 3 minute overture, intermission, and exit music, along with ending credits.The special features on this two-disc special edition of ""2001"" are pretty good, but they felt sort of repetitive to me. The Disc 1 comes with the film, along with a commentary by Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood and the theatrical trailer, and then there's the disc 2. The first special feature is titled ""2001: The Making of a Myth"". It's about 45 minutes long. It's narrated by James Cameron, and shows different people talking about the making and legacy of the movie. It was pretty good. ""Standing on the Shoulders of Kubrick: The Legacy of 2001"" is about 20 minutes long and is another film that talks about the legacy of the movie and different film critics, including Roger Ebert (when he could still talk), praising the film. It's really not much that the earlier featurette hasn't said. ""Vision of a Future Passed: The Prophecy of 2001"" is 20 minutes of Keir Dullea, the main star of ""2001"" speaking about the film and what Arthur C. Clarke, the author of ""2001"" wrote and said about it. It also includes black-and-white audio footage of  Arthur C. Clarke. It was a pretty good featurette, but I really like the 60's vintage featurette ""2001: A Space Odyssey - A Look Behind the Future"". It's about 20-25 minutes and it shows the film being made including footage of Stanley Kubrick. It's one of my favorite featurettes. ""2001: FX and Early Conceptual Artwork"" is 9 minutes long and shows Stanley's wife, Christiane Kubrick, talking about the artwork and paintings made for the famous ""Stargate"" sequence in the film for 3 minutes, and the rest shows the original sketches and paintings. It's pretty cool. ""Look: Stanley Kubrick!"" is 3 minutes long and shows a montage of photos Stanley Kubrick shot in his few years before directing when he was still working for ""Look! Magazine"". Here, you see Stanley's extreme talent for photography, which definitely influenced his creativeness in directing. The real treat here is the 1 hour, 17 minute audio-only interview from 1966, where Jeremy Bernstein interview's Stanley Kubrick, titled ""Audio-only interview with Stanley Kubrick"". Here, he talks about his childhood, his photography days, his first movie, ""Fear and Desire"", and later on, talks about each and every one of his films, leading up to ""2001"", which was still in production at that time. It's extremely interesting and worth listening to. I think it's the best featurette on the second disc.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a truly beautiful, mesmerizing, and amazing film that everybody should see, and it's brilliance just can't fit into the 6000 characters that Amazon reviews allow. All I have to say is, if you haven't seen this Stanley Kubrick masterpiece, see it now! And see it multiple times after that. It's one of the greatest."	5.0	One of the greatest films of all time.	2011-10-14	6	6	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A24QKJEGSWTGPE	9 2 5...	Few auteurs in film history possess the visionary talent that Kubrick had.  His Space Odyssey, the first film of its kind, proves that.  Invoking awe and wonder in new audiences and old, the film stands the test of time and continues to inspire.The film is meant to be viewed on a large auditorium screen, and though Kubrick was an avid supporter for mono sound, today's modern sound technology provides for a much better experience.  The hums and clicks of the spaceships, the vaccuum of space, and the brilliant soundtrack create an eerie aura, made more believable with surround sound.  The best way to view this film is to do so in a theatre.  Kubrick intended for his audience to view the Odyssey on the big screen.  This way, the film transports its audience to space itself, and embarks on a timeless journey for the ages.  There are many long shots of spacecraft and nebulae that a television set simply can't reproduce on the same scale of the theatre.  It's like viewing the Mona Lisa on a mail stamp.The story should be familiar to audiences by now.  On the surface, the plot is one of Kubrick's more simple ones, but critics go very deep into its symbols, allegories, and other interpretings.  Many filmgoers are turned off by its curious ending, but that is because they simply don't understand it.  Just keep in mind that the ending represents man's evolution.As for the DVD, many complain that the transfer quality is poor, but I hold no grievances whatsoever.  I enjoy viewing the film in its original state, just like its first audiences saw it.  It is clean enough to enjoy without distraction, and the sound was upgraded to Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  If you are a true Kubrick nut, however, then you will want to alter the sound output to mono, but that option is up to your discretion.	5.0	Kubrick's Magnum Opus	2007-06-04	5	4	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AAKF9UNZU7AFO	"""aaagew"""	Before you watch this movie, you should be aware that this is not a typical movie...at all.  If you are used to romantic comedies or even Star Wars-esque space operas, you will be dazed and confused by the end of the movie.  There is very little dialogue, not much of a concrete plot and no set antagonist and protagonist (except the HAL/David part).2001 is one of those rare movies that actually ask you to think and form your own conclusions about what is happening.  Because the whole movie revels in ambiguity, I can only give my impression of the message.  To me, it is about the thin line between a tool and a weapon, and the destructive possibilties of each that we rely heavily on for our survival.  To me, it's about the loss of humanity when we become to dependent on things other than ourselves (which seems to be the theme of Radiohead's &quot;OK Computer&quot;).There is a little bit of actual plot to it.  A strange, black, rectangular object (the Monolith) appears at crucial points in human evolution.  Other than that, it's very vague.I read that, when it was released in 1968, hippies would take LSD and lay on the floor of the theater, staring in awe at the movie.  I can certainly see why.  The last half an hour is, without a doubt in my mind, the &quot;trippiest&quot; visuals ever put to film.While this movie is not for everyone, nearly everyone who researches film history must be insane to say it is not a groundbreaking film.  The special effects are still amazing 33 years after its release.  The science is very well thought out and accurate (spaceships do NOT make sounds in the vacuum of outer space).  I would highly recommend this visually stunning, groundbreaking, thought-provoking film to anyone.	5.0	A classic, a masterpiece, a...you get the idea.	2001-01-11	10	9	1

Stanley Kubrick pushed the envolope and showed a futurist showcase of the life of tomorrow. This movie almost feels like you are watching a ballet from start to finish with the music and the dancing images. Also, no movie has ever showed Alien encounters of this magnitude. You feel confused and full of questions about what happens during the encounter and what happen to Dave Bowman (even more so then Contact). One word of addvice for people who do want to watch this classic, read the book first. If you don't read the book, you will have trouble following the movie because of the little dialogue that occurs in this movie.

Truthfully the film is important enough to merit the attention. The new MGM transfer comes in two flavors. 1. Standard release 2. Deluxe collectors edition.Both prints are struck off a wonderfull new master and in most respects this is a definitive A/V transfer. Key differences are as follows. The standard version contains the movie, and I believe thats it. The Deluxe edition contains the Film, a music CD which is already available elsewhere and many 2001 fans already have, and a film image and a booklet.The Deluxe edition is a disapointment. While the collector type goodies included are nice they are not what one would call significant or important. 2001 is worthy of a real ""special edition"" which actually reflects the imporance of the film, not this artifical ""product"".I admit I could have saved myself frustration if I'd read more closely I have only myself to blame but it is still frustrating that a movie that deserves a landmark bonus section has been denied it."	4.0	NOTE: Prior error	2001-06-17	2	2	0

I can still do a convincing hominid impersonation, usually at cocktail functions after too many g&t;'s.There is no doubt that Mr K made challenging and interesting movies, and having seen all of them I like to pretend that I discovered this. But he never made a movie that people could enjoy on anything but a cold, superior, intellectual level. For example, if he had made the movie 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", I am sure that Roger would have had some interesting things to say to us about the duality of self consciousness, instead of 'wah,wah,wah!'HAL9000 was our Adam, on 'speed'. God made man. Man made A.I. Man kills god. A.I. kills man. Life's little symetries, are taken exploitively to new levels of sillyness to fill out flimsy PhD submissions and dead film plots.

Possibly because NASA's manned space program was killed by Washington accounting. Possibly because the USA wasn't really up to it and the whole space program was a stunt, rather than an agenda.

Stanley Kubrick, in my opinion, a brilliant director, and Arthur C. Clark, renowned science fiction autor, created this story, both in book and film. Together, they wanted to make a mature science fiction movie giving ideas of the human race's place in existance. This movie and the book do such a job of doing this that no other book or film has even come close. Using much symbolism and imagery, rather than obvious audio, the team orchestrated an intellectually stimulating, philosophically empowered movie. Word of warning, this movie is not designed as a regular two- hourshow that tells the audiance everything that goes on. It actually tells very little,so be ready to think. I suggest this movie to anyone intersted in the big picture of life and existance.	5.0	A Symbolic Masterpiece	2004-07-25	7	5	2
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1G3TE56DN52ME	Adam Lenhardt	I purchased the recently remastered [this version of] 2001: A Space Odyssey DVD only days after it's release, without ever having seen this movie before. While I most defineately don't regret my decision, I can't give it five stars. I shall explain my reasons below.The production is first rate. Stanley Kubrick depiction of space is timeless... and considering the release date of this movie, it is quite probably the first movie to offer a believeable depiction of space. Innovative camera and set tricks aid a perfect depiction of zero gravity. In fact, I'd say nearly half of this movie's appeal is the incredible eye candy. Save for the psychedelic journey beyond the infinites at the end, it's impossible to tell that this movie was made in the 1960's.The story is sparce, and isn't meant to be taken out of the movie. The plot is the setting for the eye candy and the issues which Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick present to us.Many of the ideas in this movie share a basis with those presented in a later Kubrick project A.I. They are issues which have only become more relevant with the passage of three decades. 2001 and A.I. are really the same idea, told from opposing viewpoints. In A.I., Kubrick and Spielberg speak in favor of the machines. In 2001, Kubrick and Clarke speak in favor of humanity. The humanity of 2001 also relies on machines. When the H.A.L. 9000 fails and turns homicidal, the main character David disables the computer which activates a message containing information known only to the computer. Humanity has begun to trust it's creations more than itself. As this revelation dawns upon us, we are taken upon a surreal journey to the next evolution of humanity, where my only critism of the film resides.Once Dave reaches Jupiter, he is sent on a journey &quot;Beyond the Infinites&quot;, represented by color altered obsure photography, and bizzarre camera action. Dave finishes his journey and finds himself... in a Victorian-style room. The camera takes on the view from David's eyes as he watches an old man. Then takes the view to the old man's eyes as he watches an old man. And so on until the person being watched is taking his last breathes, when he dies and is reborn as the star child, greater than the machines it once greated. The sequence is powerful, yet is limit by how obscure it's presentation is... The victorian room seems out of place, in a movie thus far dedicated to the most realistic possible depiction of things, we are given an odd representation of the aliens land. The progression of David (he is watching himself) will be lost on much of the audience, and it's intended meaning will be lost as well. On top of that, the journey from beginning to end is a slow and dull one. It is a movie greater than itself, but as it's soul is in it's ideas, rather than it's story, it doesn't make very good repeat viewing.	4.0	Innovative and visionary... yet slow and surreal	2001-08-10	4	1	3

The reason so many ""intelligent"" viewers say it's great is because they feel they are supposed to; otherwise other ""intelligent"" viewers will dismiss them and say, ""You just don't get it."" I would go so far as to say no one gets it. Kubrick was so full of himself that he made a film that was totally self indulgent. If you question the greatness of his work then you must be questioning his greatness; and to do so would be ""unintelligent"". What a load! Granted he gave us a glimpse of what everyday life may be like in the future, but that alone does make for a great film. A 20 minute short could have done the same without being so presumptuous. If anyone disagrees, then by all means share with us what makes this film great. Please enlighten us but try not to sound too full of yourself."	1.0	"Just another case of the ""King's clothes""..."	2007-05-24	41	9	32
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	ADRIENNE MILLER	2001 - A Space Odyssey is one weird but gorgeous film. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, this movie is considered his masterpiece. It is classic sci-fi but I didn't enjoy the film that much. There's barely any dialogue but the ending is quite brilliant. You can't take this film seriously because it's difficult to explain. It's just one of those movies you have to see to believe.	3.0	Yikes!	2008-04-29	4	1	3
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3MODJJA6RLGJ3	afried01	2001 A Space Odyssey is a movie that challenges our assumptions about extraterrestrial life. It also considers the many truths and dangers regarding living and working in space. However, what makes this movie extraordinary is the music. It is all classical and very &#34;Surreal.&#34; It is a serious movie with none of the stupid one-liner humor you hear in many contemporary science fiction movies. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, but in particular to serious space and science fiction buffs who enjoy seeing more realistic interpretations of space travel and extraterrestrial contact. The Blu-ray edition makes the experience even more fulfilling.	5.0	Awesome movie way ahead of its time	2014-03-14	2	1	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3VSXJ959S2HY0	Agent Smith	"This movie is incredibly boring, content-less and primitive. I bought blu ray edition based on 990+ mostly positive reviews on Amazon. Now I am puzzled - how could this movie ever get 5 stars? The only explanation I have it was kind of cool in 1969 and people who watched it back then are nostalgic. Nowadays I do not find it's cool to watch black screen for 5 minutes wondering if my disk/player/projector are OK. That is right - movie has black scenes with nothing for minutes (kudos to ""Black Square"" Malevich?), accompanied by a most terrible psychedelic music (?) ever. I really had to mute and fast forward it quite a bit. On the other hand movie is somewhat OK if you want to fall asleep, which I did twice (here comes one star from me). Few bright moments of light/action/dialog in the universe of boredom barely occupy a few minutes of footage continued by hours of rotating still images and annoying Windows Media Player type of visual kaleidoscope. You would see all kind of nonsense: Pan-Am waitresses doing a lot of baby steps in circles; pen flying for minutes; annoying ""monkeys"" jumping and crying for half an hour; repetitive scenes of ""space ships"" flying up close (one hour?); somebody breathing heavily for 10 minutes into microphone, twice; eating miserable colored humus-like space food for 5 minutes; etc. Sparse dialogs are not nearly as deep as some suggested and reminded me naive baby talks: ""[Mummy], please, I will never do it again, I promise"", ""Hal, do you hear me? Please answer me, please.. (repeated 5-10 times)"", ""I can not talk about it right now"", ... I guess if this extreeeeeeemely long chewing gum is compressed into 10 minutes cartoon for kids if would become average. Otherwise, total waste of my money-time continuum."	1.0	unbiased first time watcher	2009-11-19	87	14	73
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ	"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool"""	"Kubrick's 1968 film loves music, hates linear thought, forces audiences to make their own assumptions, and finally chills your bones to the core even 40 years after its release.  From the iconic now-pop-culture beginnings of the true ""Dawn of Man"" to the lackluster, yet still visual ""Space Child"" expression, ""2001"" is pure brilliance in its rawest form.  Listed on copious top ten lists around the world, ""2001"" continues to provide conversation and thought, even long after its expiration date.  Cinema, after the creation of Kubrick's film, has continued to borrow, explore, expand, and even parody this pioneering film.  Lucas' Death Star has nothing on Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke's monolith.  This was the first.  The film is a pioneer of science fiction filmmaking, which inspired a new generation and gave audiences more than just cheap effects with little green men.  Kubrick created a film that makes you think, not just about what is happening on the screen, but also what the future holds.  In 1968, 2001 seemed like a million years away, and this is what Kubrick thought we would look like - now, in 2008, if he were alive - he could make a film called ""2012: A Space Odyssey"" and this critic would believe his view of the distant future.  In other words, this film - although the date has passed - is still as relevant and critically powerful as it was in 1968.Kubrick opens our film with the power of sound.  Like an opera beginning its set, we are left in the dark as our musicians begin their concertos that fill our ears with emotion and the unknown.  Beginning in this way, it takes us (in a positive way) out of the feeling of the film, and that we are sitting in the best seats of the house for a performance of the theater of the absurd.  With words reminiscent of Beckett, Kubrick brings both a voice and a sound to this film that is difficult to find in today's modern science fiction films.  A modern similarity would be the independent film ""Primer"", but even that is a long shot.  What makes ""2001"" more than just a film is the classical music Kubrick uses.  As the film progresses, it feels as if the music was made with this film in mind.  The ""dawn of man"" with the booming overture as our ape ancestors claw at the monolith will, and has, remained a staple in the cinematic world.  With this sheet of black metal, Kubrick created a sound and an image that could never be duplicated - while some have tried - the emotion and feeling when the Sun and Earth crest the monolith on Mars can never be reproduced.  With a minimal script, language used as a secondary way to complete the story, the sound needed to be perfect - and the full bodied orchestra did better than perfect.  It created a sound for a place that is devoid of everything except darkness ... space.With my ogling of sound complete, there were other elements of ""2001"" that were equally sharp and powerful.  By dating a film there is always the risk of arriving to that date without finding any of the predictions true, the film becomes a cultural hick-up and forgotten in the canyons of cinema.  What makes Kubrick's film impeccable is its ability to grow outside of the normality of average science fiction.  While it holds a date of 2001, it does not mean that the Kubrick's themes become dated.  This is difficult to explain, but watching ""2001"" in 2008 still was impressive.  The technological advances, the exploration of the unknown, the questionable ethics of evolution still resonates in today's society and I feel that Kubrick knew this while making this film.  Sure, this was his idea (or perhaps Clarke's idea) of the future, but it is still the future.  By book marking it with the unspoken birth of humanity and with the rebirth of the ""Space Child"" - it transcends the 2001-esque moments.  What makes this film go beyond the 2001 pitfall is that rarely is it mentioned the actual date.  Outside of the title sequence and the brief moment with HAL, this film could be placed anywhere - and it does.  Do not be fooled by the title, this is still a relevant film today as it was yesterday and through the years to come.One still cannot speak about this film without talking about HAL and that infamous line about the ""pod bay doors"".  It has become more than just cultural chatter, but wine-chatter with film snobs.  It is an important and provocative moment of the film, but the events surrounding it contain just as much recognition.  In one fell swoop, HAL changes and the dawn of man becomes a page in the history books.  The machines have become smarter than their creators, and a new dawn has arrived.  Kubrick's scenes surrounding HAL were phenomenally spooky.  That looming yellow eye stayed with me long after the film and can be still seen in current cinematic releases.  With one fell swoop of the camera, Kubrick created man, developed the monolith, brought fear into technology, and then attempted to explain the meaning of life.  What - I ask - what other film can be said to have done this with as much mastery, originality, and creativity as ""2001: A Space Odyssey""?  None.Overall, this film has impressed me completely.  The Homer-esque journey that we, the viewer, take on this film is unparallel in any other cinematic adventure.  No other director could have helmed this project as well as given the darkness, the fear, the hope, and the overall sense of excitement to the screen.  Kubrick was a film pioneer, his voice can continue to be heard today with any science fiction film that is released, and it is all due to this one singular film that chose to open with darkness and the score of an opera, and end with the eyes of a child.  This is a science fiction film, but it is more than that.  This is a history book.  It is a page of our life that nobody wants to see.  The monolith could represent anything, and there are film classes that spend years discussing it - and that is why this movie will remain firmly rooted in our catalogue.  I loved the sounds, I loved the technology, I loved the dark vacuum of space, but most importantly, I loved the unknown.  This was not a linear story that one could watch and forget about - out of respect to Kubrick - watch this film, watch it again - point out the unknown and keep it fresh in your friend's mind.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A37QXYOALG9Y4J	Alan Lawn	"Here's what stood out to me:1. The music. On the one hand, duh. On the other, have you actually listened to ""On the Beautiful Blue Danube"" recently? It's 10+ minutes of constant enjoyment -- every melody is beautiful. Of course, another Strauss also has his moments. What most intrigued me, though, were the selections by Gy&ouml;rgy Ligeti. I don't usually appreciate atonal or unmelodic pieces, but the ""monolith theme"" is an awesome blend of the haunting, intense, and otherworldly. Notably, Kubrick commissioned a score by Alex North but then decided to use the classical recordings he had been playing during production -- without telling North.2. The new bone. At the end of ""The Dawn of Man"" chapter, the triumphant tool-user throws his tapir bone (which he just used to beat the life out of a rival hominid) into the air, and the scene artfully cuts from the bone to its modern counterpart: a white, cylindrical nuclear device orbiting the earth. That's deep. Or maybe I'm just a sucker for a good transition.3. The visual realism. The space exploration special effects hold up remarkably well considering that the film turns 40(!) this year. Not only do they look realistic, they also illustrate Kubrick's attention to procedural detail. He uses extended shots of relatively mundane activities in order to give us a sense of what it's like in the vacuum and how exactly people get things done.4. The computer. HAL's got a great voice (he's going to sing ""Fitter Happier"" in my remake). And his lines aren't half-bad, either. If only his shipmates weren't so wooden and...mechanical. (Was Kubrick trying to say something about astronauts -- that the government preferred unimaginative military men to a fault?) If I were on board, I'd've picked his brain nonstop. A conscious computer would never get old. Forget chess -- imagine having a conversation about philosophy, or anything else for that matter. What would you talk about?5. The end. What's the deal? The protracted light show screams ""we've got to do something with all these FX shots,"" especially when the colored landscapes kick in after what I thought would be the climax (when everything appears to be culminating in a burst of white light). And then there's the bizarre room sequence. I won't spoil it; I'll just speculate: is this how the aliens wanted Dave to perceive his transformation? Or is it Kubrick reminding us that 2001 is an art film, infinitely beyond trashy sci-fi?"	5.0	Mesmerizing, Not Boring	2008-07-16	1	0	1

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A13JCOKL7319RW	alexander750	(Note: This is based on the DVD version.)When director Stanley Kubrick approached Arthur C. Clarke* in 1967 to create the first &#34;good science fiction film,&#34; the state of the art up until that time was still the cheesy, B-movie flicks like &#34;Fantastic Voyage,&#34; &#34;The Day the Earth Stood Still,&#34; and &#34;Godzilla.&#34; True, &#34;Star Trek&#34; was on TV by this time, but it was TV, constrained by the imperatives of the medium: many at that time still owned only black-and-white sets.&#34;2001&#34; changed everything.Starting with Kubrick's insistence on using 70mm film, a screenplay co-written by him and Clarke, and a top-notch classical soundtrack which introduced many to the music of Richard Strauss and Gy&#337;rgi Ligeti, &#34;2001&#34; ditched the cheese and introduced us to a future that was not only possible but realistic (complete with product placements!). Within two years we would be on the moon; was our first encounter with the Monolith coming up next?As Sir Arthur would later remind us, &#34;what the US spent in Vietnam could easily have paid for everything depicted in '2001'.&#34; Watching this movie now, in 2013, brings a sense not only of wonder, but regret. And yet: no &#34;2001,&#34; no &#34;Star Wars&#34;--or any of the technology and techniques needed to make the current generation of F&SF; blockbusters.	5.0	A reminder of our stolen future--still classic after all these years	2013-10-30	2	1	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	ANUN5B8HYZXEJ	Alexander Arsov	Let me make this clear in the beginning: the extravagant praise usually accorded to Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' I have always found frightfully perplexing. All the more so since Arthur Clarke'seponymous novelis without any reservations among my all-time favourite books. The importance of Stanley Kubrick, however, ends with his stimulating effect over Arthur Clarke during the bizarre brainstorming of which both the novel and the screenplay - written in parallel - were born. The complicated relationship between both mediums has been eloquently described by Arthur Clarke himself in his lovely little bookThe Lost Worlds of 2001(1972). But it is the movie I am here dealing with.Now, I wish there was other say to say it, but there isn't: the movie is perfect crap! What exactly its classical status rests upon is an absolute mystery for me. It is a visual tour de force all right, but that's just about the only asset it might possibly have. Except perhaps that some of its music is among the greatest ever composed; if, indeed, the movie has brought to more receptive ears the famous opening of Richard Strauss' magnificent tone poem ''Also Sprach Zarathustra'', that's something; actually, this opening is famous more because of this movie than because of anything else, I think. As for the visual side, it is not nearly as impressive today as it must have been in 1968, of course, but it has aged surprisingly well. So much for the good sides though.For otherwise the movie is one failure after another. To begin with, a good many people have complained that when they saw it before the book, they didn't understand the ending at all - only later did the novel make it clear. This is as expected - for the ending is an incomprehensible mess. What's worse, the pace is appallingly slow - imagine a spaceship landing that lasts for full ten minutes, during which you can appreciate Strauss' famous waltz ''An der sch&ouml;nen blauen Donau'', another musical masterpiece from the soundtrack. But even the greatest music cannot make the scene less tedious. The whole cast is downright horrible. Keir Dullea is as dull as a Dave Bowman as one could possibly imagine; the famous dramatic dialogue with HAL is ridiculously inept. The philosophical depth of the novel is completely, absolutely and overwhelmingly missing from the screen adaptation.Surely the movie must have been groundbreaking visually in 1968 - and perhaps not only visually indeed - but what is there to keep it in the stores forty years later I have not the least idea. I wonder how far it would have gone had it not been accompanied by the novel, first published few months after the world premiere.	1.0	Most probably the most over-rated movie in history: zero stars!	2011-06-17	38	8	30
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A9UU8OR0TBMHE	Alexander Nordquist	2001: a space odyssey is the best science fiction film I have ever seen! I have seen many other science fiction movies like the time machine, back to the future and 2010 which is the sequal. But none of those have ever gotten close.The very first time I saw this movie was when I rented it from the library at my school. My dad said it would be good because he saw the movie when it was out in the theaters. So when I watched the movie I loved every part of it and since I liked it so much I had to get the DVD and that was good because I could see a big difference in the picture.The movie starts out in the period of the apes which they call &quot;The Dawn Of Man&quot;. It shows how the apes were like hundreds of years ago. One time the apes are drinking water when another group of apes try to fight to get it and eventually they scare our group away. Then one morning one of the apes wakes up and he discovers the first monolith that the aliens put on the earth a long time ago. Then after that some of the apes are looking at some of the bones and investigating them. Untill the first discovery is made because of the monolith where one ape finally discovers that he can use the bone as a tool. Then it's really easy for the apes to defeat the other apes the next morning to get the water, all because they learned how to use the tool!In the next part Dr. Floyd is traveling from the earth to the moon to investigate the 2nd monolith that the astronauts have discovered on the moon. Dr. Floyd has a talk with some other people at the station and they discuss what has happened and pretty soon he goes with other astronauts to see the monolith untill they here a signal telling them to go to jupiter.Then you see Dr. David Bowmen, Dr. Frank Poole, three other astronauts put to sleep in a state of hibernation and the new Hal 9000 all on the &quot;Discovery&quot; spaceship. You mostly see Dave and Frank talking to Hal even playing a game of chess with him but suddently Hal picks up an error with the AE35 unit and says it will fail within 72 hours. But when Dave reels the part in and examines it he says there is no problem but Hal says the 9000 series is always accurate. When Dave and Frank discuss the problem in the pod, Hal reads their lips and overhears what they say. So then he kills the guys in hibernation, shoots Frank in space and locks Dave out when he trys to rescue him. When Dave finally gets in through the emergency airlock and takes some of Hal's brains out he's on his own to go to Jupiter.In the next part Dave is travelling in the pod to some other part in space and this is when I thought the movie was a bit weird. He goes through many different colors untill he gets to some room that looks like an ordinary room only he hears strange sounds. Then you see 3 different versions of him as an older person untill finally he sees the last monolith and turns into the STAR CHILD!!!It is hard for me to write in words how I really think about this movie but I try to do the best I can.If you love science fiction movies and have never seen this one you MUST SEE IT NOW!!!!!!	5.0	The Best Science Fiction Film Ever!!!!	2003-08-03	3	3	0

Stanley Kubrick was a genius beyond all description and so is 2001: A Space Odyssey. The music works with the film perfectly.One thing about this beautiful work of art that I don't think has been mentioned is that it contains (to me, at least) one of the most emotional scenes in the history of cinema. That is, when the dying Dave on his death bed reaches out to the Monolith and you hear once more ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" and you realize the absolute genius of Kubrick's depiction of transcendental evolution with spiritual, religious, and philosophical significance in spades. I don't think I've ever had a more emotionally powerful reaction to anything in a movie as Dave transcending humanity and becoming the Starchild in that magnificent sequence.The great thing is that this film is full of emotional rollercoaster rides...once you understand what the film is attempting to express (the metaphysical evolution of mankind), you can fully appreciate how powerful it is.

When watching many different  movies it's important that you pay close attention to what you HEAR instead  of what you SEE. The dialogue is the most important thing in the movie.  Think of the films of Martin Scorsese or Spike Lee. If you miss certain  parts of the dialogue you'll be lost for the whole rest of the story. But  that's not the case with this masterpiece by Kubrick. There is I believe  only 40 minutes of dialogue. So basically your just looking at your screen  and watching something you'll never forget. The screenplay done here by  Kubrick and Clarke is amazing. This will turn our to be a one of a kind  movie you will never forget.Which is all due to the astonishing images  projected on screen. Kubrick really out did himself and set a very high  standard for others to try and reach. A must for movie fans!	4.0	A Movie You Look At Instead Of Listening To	2000-08-10	3	3	0

When I got mine and viewed it, I was NOT disappointed!  It's the BEST blu ray quality I've seen on over 100 blu rays that I own, period-- and it doesn't need any allowances for being a 1968 film, it beats TODAY'S blu rays head to head!!Well, the picture is simply OUTSTANDING--just beautiful. Sharpness, pretty colors--color hue and strength, overall ""newness"" to the look . . . this is how this movie should always have been.  You can see every bit of detail on each actor's face, and the fleshtones (and other colors) are exactly accurate.  The color is so vivid and the sharpness so unbelievable, it's incredible that this is a 1968 film; from the amazing blu ray picture quality, one would have thought it was made TODAY. It has simply amazing picture quality and crystal-clear audio quality.In regards to the film/story/acting/script itself, I love it, always have, and frankly, I DON'T think it is ""dated."" On the contrary, it is quite fresh, to me.  The photography is simply mesmerizingly beautiful, the classical music playing at many times just so powerful, melodic, and pretty.  I never watched this film for the acting and so I can't comment on it; I watched it for its visual beauty, the incredible music, and the futuristic feel (and please note: I'm not a science fiction fan generally).A landmark film, it was very contemporary then AND now, and still completely relevant . . . this film has it all, to me, providing a ""100"" ""experience"" (on a scale of TEN) for a futuristic look at the earth and the universe.Perfectly mastered on Blu Ray?

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3R6FN40CO2FMJ	Allen Whitaker	This film is undoubtedly one of the great films of all time.  Stanly Kubrick's painstaking direction, special effects and musical score remain a benchmark for great cinema, irrespective of the genre.  The quality of the transfer from film to DVD is good in the actual film, but the overture, Intermission and actor interviews are audio only and do not have the video accompaniment of the original film, thus I only gave it four stars.  There are two versions of this film on DVD, a two disk set and this single disk version which contains only the film itself and the aforementioned Audio interviews and musical sound track.  If all you're looking for is this great film well enhanced in the DVD format, this DVD can be had for a very reasonable price and is well worth the cost.	4.0	The Quintessential Science Fiction Epic Beautifully Enhanced on DVD	2013-03-17	0	0	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AH4SL0YL5AQVU	Alric the Red	"I owned the older featureless version of this film, and because it already looked very good upconverted, I didn't see a real need to upgrade.  But this Blu-ray edition was given to me for Christmas, and the picture is so sharp and so bright, all those teeming details and contrast feel almost physical in the eyes.  There was a distinct difference, and had I known, I would have made the upgrade myself.  And, of course, now I can see those extra features I'd been missing.  From what I've gathered, all of them from the SE made it to the Blu-ray, and I've spent the last few hours devouring them.  Some of them feel redundant at times, sharing some of the same clips and restating the obvious, but if you're interested in every morsel about the film, they're all good.  I'll give you a rundown of them instead of reviewing the film itself, which really is pointless here.The first is the longest (about 40 minutes), ""2001: The Making of a Myth,"" and has interviews with various people involved with the technical elements, the inspiration, the problems, and all put in relation to the zeitgeist, revealing just how remarkable an achievement it was.  Even the mime artist playing Moonwatcher (the ape man) shares his experience, showing just how much attention to detail went into every aspect of it.Briefly, the others: ""Standing on the Shoulders of Kubrick: The Legacy of 2001"" (about 21 minutes long) reflects on the considerable influence Kubrick and this film had on other directors; ""Vision of a Future Passed: The Prophecy of 2001"" (about 20 minutes), details the science behind it; ""2001: A Look Behind the Future"" (about 23 minutes), a behind-the-scenes visit by LOOK magazine while the film was still in production, an artifact looking charmingly retro with its 1960s pasty color film stock; ""What is Out There"" (about 20 minutes), a conjecture about alien intelligence, including a revelation that the film almost had a different ending; ""2001: FX and Early Conceptual Artwork"" (about 9 minutes), covers almost exclusively the design and execution of that final stargate sequence; ""Look: Stanley Kubrick!"", is a short montage of some of Kubrick's photos he shot for LOOK magazine; and, lastly, a 76-minute audio-only interview with Kubrick, in which he reveals himself as capable of being candid and warm.Good stuff, all.  The only feature I haven't investigated yet is the commentary track by Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3BHN5BGICORAW	A Main	Being 12 years old, many people would say to me ''Why are you watching this?'' and ''You wont like this''.To be perfectly honest, I was confused but after careful thought and consideration [and asking everyone in my family about their own theories of the ending],I have came  to realise that 2001 was a well made movie and wait in anticipation to watch again or even buy this movie!!Here's my interpretation and summary of the movie..Millions of years ago, an object called a monolith came to earth and magically made primates evolve into human beings.Zoom millions of years into the future and we are placed in space with a crew sent  to investigate another monolith placed on the planet Jupiter.The crew  hear an ear splitting noise then we jump further into the future and we are on the spaceship ''Discovery'' with Commander Dave Bowman,Frank Poole,3 scientists in hyper sleep and one, soon to be psychotic, computer named ''HAL''.Fearing that their mission is too important to mess with, HAL terminates the life support machines which keep the scientists alive.When out in space HAL kills Frank Pool and attempts to kill our hero Dave Bowman.Once back in the ship, Dave disconnects HALs memory and brain.Dave notices another monolith near Jupiter and from then on this movie is placed in the science fiction hall of fame.The ending still baffles me which keeps it from getting its 5th star but a brilliant understated performance from our ''STARBABY'' Keir Dullea keeps this movie from becoming completeley confusing.Be on the look out for my review on its sequel ''2010 The Year We Make Contact''.I give this movie **** out of ***** [4 out of 5].	4.0	Short of being a masterpiece but still the ultimate trip!	2001-07-05	4	3	1

Kubrick was a genius, never satisfied with the state of the craft, always determined to reach for the bleeding edge of cinematic art.There are complaints that there are less than 15 mins of active dialogue in the film. To those that complain, they have missed the point. Kubrick's story is here. It's our story. And Kubrick has always forced us to confront the reality of  our humanity. Whether we like it or not.The film would be enough, but this version of the blu-ray edition comes packed with extras that makes the purchase even more worthwhile.Shipped quickly, with excellent packaging.Highly recommended.During that missing year maybe Kubrick filmed the moon landing, maybe not. But one thing is certainly clear. His incredible attention to detail and meticulous handling of the piece.&#34;My God...

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2AVV9LV9UXT6F	Amazon Customer	"There are things I positively love about this movie.  There are other things that I genuinely dislike.  As a result, I am not prepared to hail this film as the greatest science fiction movie of all time, as so many do.  On the positive side, the movie deserves real credit for bringing a serious approach to the science fiction genre.  One must remember that in 1968, science fiction was a genre thoroughly sneered at by most people.  Printed sci-fi was still only just breaking out of the pulp level, and the disrespect that accompanied it.  ""Star Trek"", while it was around, had yet to prove what a phenomenon it would become.  And the vast majority of science fictions films made prior to ""2001"" had been B-grade, low-budget movies with juvenile plots, and second rate actors, and the whole genre was defintely still saddled with the stigma of the pulp magazines and Saturday morning serials -- strictly kid-stuff.  With ""2001"", Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clark collaborated on a film that treated the subject matter respectfully, presented future technology realistically, and was meant to be taken seriously by the most discriminating viewers.  ""2001"" also deserves credit for absolutely first rate special effects.  They are, in fact, so good that they couldn't be bettered even by todays most advanced CGI effects.  This is not to say today's effects aren't far more sophisticated, and capable of bringing more spectacular effects to life on screen than the technology of 1968 permitted, it's just that the effects of ""2001"" perfectly achieve the goal of special effects: they make what they depict look absolutely real.  The effects of ""2001"" do this; they capture, with utter realism, the look of ACTUAL spaceflight, at our current level of technology (or something close to it).  The ships look like real spacecraft, and move like real spacecraft.  There is also no sound (except the musical score) to be heard at all in the scenes of spaceflight.  This is one of the only sci-fi films to depict the soundlessness of space, most other sci-fi movies having chosen to add sound for dramatic effect, inaccurate though that is.  This ultra-realistic approach was indeed groundbreaking in 1968, and helped convince people to take the movie, and the genre, seriously, and ""2001"" absolutely deserves recognition for that.But unfortunately, the movie has serious flaws as well.  To begin with, it's slooooooow.  The movie moves at a frankly ponderous pace.  The dialogue is minimal, to say the least, and while the visuals are truly breathtaking, they can't, all by themselves, entirely take care of the exposition that any move needs.  As a result, a lot of people have to have this movie explained to them before they really understand what it's all about.  I first saw it when I was ten, and at that age, it went right over my head.  I read the book about a year later, and then finally understood it.  That's not good.  Any movie should be able to stand entirely on its own, so this is not really a good quality.  Some folk may cite this quality as evidence of the film's artistic greatness, but that is, in my opinion, pretentious and nothing more.  Art does not have to be esoteric to be great, it just has to stand the test of time.  As evidence of this, I point to the plays of William Shakespeare, which were written as entertainment for the masses, not the elite.  This movie was groundbreaking.  But it is also a movie which I suspect more people praise than actually enjoy.  I salute the movie, and its makers for giving the genre a serious, thoughtful treatment; but I can't help but wonder if the science fiction genre wouldn't be more mainstream today if the first ""serious"" sci-fi film had been not only groundbreaking, but really entertaining as well."	3.0	An overrated, yet groundbreaking movie.	2006-05-29	11	2	9

And, this special environment is made even more surreal by the very special soundtracks of ""Atmospheres"" by Gyorgy Ligeti , ""Timesteps"" by Wendy Carlos, or the  score in The Shining by Carlos' couple too.

My god, the pacing of the movie is just agonizing! If you're going to watch this, make sure you watch it via a media you can visually scan through.  I watched it via Amazon On Demand and you can't visually scan, so I watched every agonizing moment of not one, but three or four spaceship landings, all of which are SOOO slow! Each landing takes a good 10 minutes. Walking on the moon to a big hole takes 10 minutes. Watching an apelike creature figure out a bone can be used as a weapon, 10 minutes! Horrible. I'm guessing that George Lucas took Kubricks example of what NOT to do when making all of his scenes for Star Wars and sped things up a bit! And then there's the ending....... Visually, i'm sure that in 1968 it was years ahead of it's time and something to behold. In 2014, not so much. Sorry, it isn't. Unless of course you're dropping acid ( note: neither the author of this review or Amazon.com and all it's subsidiaries suggest that you drop acid in anyway shape or form.....just say no, kids) which is what i'm guessing Kubrick was going for in 1968.In closing, do watch it, but have the remote ready.....saves a LOT of time!"	3.0	2001 in 2014.....missed it  by that much.	2014-03-03	3	2	1

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3P2R1WF7A03V1	"Amazon Customer ""NJ Review Guy"""	2001: A Space Odyssey ranks as one of the authentic masterworks of Cinema.  It's enormous impact and influence on scores of modern filmmakers and perhaps more importantly it's shaping of audience's expectations of what film could be defies easy classification.  The film, now over three decades old, still is rightfully hailed as one of the most innovative and visionary works in the history of entertainment.  Many movies claim to be epic adventures which will thrill, entertain and maybe even educate us.  Stanley Kubrick's signature film delivers all of that and is a true odyssey - a mind bending epic trip through time and the universe - a journey into the heart of the cosmos and in some ways a dreamy excursion into the very nature of reality itself.  To call 2001 merely a science-fiction movie is to casually disregard the high ambitions of Kubrick and Arthur C Clarke and to deny the powerful reactions the film has on the vast majority of those who see it.  The masterful integration of visuals, music and heady subject matter combine to become much more than the sum of the parts.  Viewing this film is undeniably a truly unique experience.A few subsequent films may have approached or even eclipsed the wondrous visual landscape of the film, however none has offered up as compelling a whole film as 2001.  The complex intellectual puzzles, the exacting prehistoric depiction of our ancestor's struggles combined with the inherently potent emotional equations which these things foster within us as a species along with the totally mind bending speculations of our journey into the future and beyond found in Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece resonate now and forever.	5.0	"Good afternoon gentlemen, I am a H.A.L. 9000 computer."""	2006-08-14	4	3	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2LZJ4XJS1A9XM	"Amazon Customer ""nospam"""	The only bad thing I can say about this film is that it does drag in places. It is supposed to do that, but the stately pace of the film may discourage some viewers.  The best thing I can say is that this film is one of the best all-time candidates for multiple viewings.  It holds up beautifully, both technically and thematically.  What's it about? You decide.  If that sounds too much like work, you'll hate this film. If not, you may just love it. I cannot even ascribe a genre - science fiction generally relies on some sort of high-technology hook, which this film lacks. It is dramatic, but not in the convoluted-plot manner of film noir. It is certainly not a costume drama.  It is not an &quot;action&quot; film, since the action scenes are so few and far between, and so dissimilar, it is almost impossible to connect them.  I have heard it described as the most expensive art film ever made.  I'd agree with that. There is a narrative, but it is the narrative of the real - as in life, the action in this film is linear but not totally coherent.  If the events narrated by this film - the discovery of an incharacterizable (if that isn't a word, it should be) artifact by humans at two key points in human evolution - actually occurred, this film is a plausible narration of the events, complete with all the subplots, uncertainty and ambiguity that would likely accompany such a discovery. Beyond that - you read into it what you will. Photographers and filmmakers - see this film and learn why Kubrick is god to many.  Of the people I know who HATE this film, and there are many, even they agree that this is a beautiful film. See it for the beatuy, but be aware that there is a LOT going on - you just have to be willing to put in the effort required to pull out the gems within. The DVD I veiwed had virtually no special features and no commentary track, but I have heard that new DVD editions of Kubricks films are coming out in late 2001 with some special features.

Watching the film was an awesome experience, especially with a sense of excitement in the cinema I was completely taken on an amazing journey by some of the most arresting stunning visions that have ever been committed to film. By the time the credits rolled, I was almost dumbstruck with same feeling that I felt I had just seen something truly special and I had to attend the cinema to try to fathom out what I had just witnessed. But in the end I had to read the actual novel of &#8220;2001&#8221; to really understand what Sir Arthur C. Clarke was trying to inform us what the film was all about and of course again seeing why Stanley Kubrick decided his personal vision in turning the intelligent novel into a visual feast for all of us fans of 2001: A Space odyssey.Developed by writer Arthur C. Clarke and director Stanley Kubrick, '2001: A Space Odyssey' begins with an extended vignette about human evolution. A bestial group of pre-humans live their daily lives in fear until they stumble upon a black, rectangular monolith. After encountering this otherworldly device, one of the creatures inexplicably invents the first tool and uses it as a club to protect his tribe. The film suddenly leaps forward to the future where man inhabits space in ships and orbiting stations. On the surface of the moon, a dig uncovers a deliberately buried monolith that's identical to the one the man-apes found at the beginning of the film.Two years later, two pilots Dave Bowman [Keir Dullea] and Frank Poole [Gary Lockwood] escorts three scientists to Jupiter on the spaceship Discovery One. The ship is run by HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain), a supercomputer that represents the pinnacle in human-created artificial intelligence. Treated like any other crew member, HAL talks to the pilots and mimics human behaviour and intelligence. Everything is seemingly routine, until HAL stumbles upon information on the secret excavation on the moon. When Dave questions HAL's reliability, the computer stages a mutiny.Like many Stanley Kubrick films, '2001: A Space Odyssey' is best approached as a cerebral endeavour rather than as outright entertainment, as Kubrick uses the trappings of the sci-fi genre to pose genuine questions of sentience, existence, and intelligence. Action fans won't find any gunfights or explosions here; instead, this is a deliberately paced adventure of the mind that requires patience, thought, and introspection. The director famously refused to explain his interpretation of the film, preferring that his audience draw their own conclusions. To be blunt, the film demands a level of engagement and intelligence from its audience that's truly rare in modern filmmaking.It's safe to say that almost everything about '2001: A Space Odyssey' is challenging and atypical. The characters are painfully naturalistic, relationships are cold and unnerving, and the ending is vague and experimental. Stanley Kubrick decided early on that he wanted the film to be a primarily non-verbal experience, and the result is an eerily quiet film. The silence is punctuated by classical music, technical banter between the astronauts, the hums and rumbles of the ship, and HAL's soothing voice.In fact, the only segment of the film that relies on a familiar genre scenario, especially HAL's mutiny that doesn't gain momentum until the final act. But even then, this classic clash of wills doesn't constitute the climax of the story, that comes a bit later as Dave is confronted with a metaphysical journey across time and space that makes for a most intriguing twist in the story.Stanley Kubrick is the only director who makes me feel like a puppet on strings, and this is the only film that manages to leave my head spinning no matter how many times I watch it. Every time I think I've got my finger on the pulse of Kubrick's methodical madness, I realise there are ideas in this film that I'll probably never completely wrap my head around. It astounds me in our age of technological advancement that a futuristic film made in 1968 remains one of the most compelling cinematic labyrinths of all time.Years ago, I gave up trying to argue the merits of the film with those who find it tedious and slow going. I've come to accept the fact that '2001' is a definitive love-it-or-hate-it film that will forever split audiences. Still, whatever you may ultimately think of the film itself, '2001: A Space Odyssey' will literally haunt your brain after you watch it. In my opinion, every film fan owes it to themselves to experience '2001' at least once in their lives.Blu-ray Video Quality &#8211; Presented with a stunning 1080p transfer on this Blu-ray and this re-mastered release of '2001: A Space Odyssey' features a revelatory upgrade in picture quality that's likely to leave fans buzzing with excitement. Colours are magnificent, rich, and stable from beginning to end. Skin tones are perfectly saturated and primary hues are bold and vibrant. Blues and reds receive the most noticeable improvement from past DVD editions, but the entire palette is striking. I'm also happy to report that contrast is dead-on, black levels are inky, and shadow delineation reveals a variety of elements formerly cloaked in darkness.Fine detail sets a new bar for high definition catalogue releases. Facial imperfections are a cinch to spot, hair is crisply defined, and the star fields are flawless. I paused on several occasions to note actors' naturally splotchy skin and chipped fingernails. There are even scenes in this transfer that I completely re-watched just to have another chance to explore the intricacies of the sets and props. For the first time, I was able to read all of the small text Kubrick strategically placed across the film. Call me obsessed, but I found myself completely fascinated by these minor details that I'd previously been unable to enjoy. Pay close attention to the barren wilderness in the opening scenes, the space station electronics, and the slightest etchings on the ships floating above Earth, this transfer is just that beautiful. The print is in excellent condition and isn't marred by softness, edge enhancement, scratches, or any distracting instances of source noise. As I watched this Blu-ray, I searched for something to complain about, but I'm happy to report that I failed to find a single thing. '2001: A Space Odyssey' has set a new bar for high quality transfers in high definition. For a film that's well over fifty years old, this high-definition release is nothing short of an awesome experience that will leave you breathless by the end credits.Blu-ray Audio Quality &#8211; This Blu-ray edition of '2001: A Space Odyssey' features an uncompressed 5.1 PCM surround track and a standard 5.1 Dolby Digital mix. While I didn't notice much of a difference between the two tracks, both sound better than ever and provides a faithful experience that still manages to enhance Kubrick's original vision.The classical music in the film opens up the sound field and resonates with solid bass and stable trebles. Dialogue is crisp and perfectly prioritised, especially with HAL's soothing tones dominating the soundscape to good effect. Sharp sounds like bestial grunts and mechanical hisses have a distinct impact, while quiet scenes on the ship are layered with a careful level of naturalistic ambiance. This was the first time I'd noticed the subtle and comprehensive intricacies of the sound design, especially with the small whirs, echoes throughout the ship, and the cooling fans inside the heavy space machinery were new to my ears. Like the clarity of fine elements in the 1080p transfer, this high definition audio package revealed details that had escaped me so many times before on home video 2-disc Special Edition DVD release and it pleased me to hear that the tracks sound so much fuller than the mix on the inferior DVD release.The only thing that modern film fans may be disappointed by is the generally front-heavy sound field. The original 6-channel stereo sound track has been remixed for 5.1 surround, but the rear channels have a limited presence that bolsters acoustics more than anything. The tone of the sound design is a clear product of the '60s, particularly evident in the tenor of the voices (which can be attributed to the original recording more than anything else). Having said all that, it's hard to fathom that '2001: A Space Odyssey' could ever sound much better than it does here.Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:Commentary by Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood: Both actors avoid diving headlong into discussions about the cultural ramifications of the film or its interpretations, but instead have an engaging conversation about Kubrick, the production, the on-set atmosphere, and reaction to the film. They share plenty of fun anecdotes and prove themselves to be generally affable gents. I didn't really learn anything new about the film per se, but it was interesting to hear their personal accounts from the trenches. The only downside is that the two actor&#8217;s clearly aren't old hands at recorded commentaries, and as a result seem to skip over some obvious scenes and topics that I would have loved to hear them discuss.2001: The Making of a Myth [43:04] Here is a Channel Four documentary that is hosted by James Cameron, along with actor Keir Dullea, co-author Sir Arthur C. Clarke and visual effects pioneer Douglas Trumball goes behind the scenes into the making of Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s classic space opera. This is a really compelling glimpse into the impact the film has made in Hollywood and the world over the decades. It documents the initial critical reaction, the eventual declaration of '2001' as a masterpiece, and a miscellaneous of other facts that kept me riveted from beginning to end.Standing on the Shoulders of Kubrick: The Legacy of 2001 [21:23] Takes a hypnotic journey with filmmakers whose own careers were inspired by this cinematic landmark. It includes interviews with notable filmmakers like George Lucas and Stephen Spielberg. This is a tight journey through a cult phenomenon that James Cameron calls &#34;a film that shouldn't work, but does.&#34;Visions of a Future Passed: The Prophecy of 2001 [21:30] Stanley Kubrick and co-author Sir Arthur C. Clarke created a finely detailed vision of the future. In this documentary, filmmakers, writers and Sir Arthur C. Clarke reflect on the accuracy of their predictions. This is an entertaining look at the technologies that the film predicted (or inspired) and the visions that have yet to transpire.2001: A Space Odyssey &#8211; A Look Behind the Future [4:3] [23:10] Look in on LOOK magazine&#8217;s charmingly retro tour of the London film set of 2001: A Space Odyssey.What is Out There? [20:40] Examines the philosophical themes of 2001: A Space Odyssey, including discussion of the possibilities of Extra-terrestrial life, the concept of God and the intersection of two possibilities if intelligent life is existing somewhere else other than on Earth.2001: FX and Early Conceptual Artwork [9:26] A retrospective of the art and visual effects designs, that led to the mind-bending visions of Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s Space Odyssey.Look: Stanley Kubrick [3:14] Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s early work as a photographer, chronicling 1940s America for LOOK magazine and reflected his natural talent for visual storytelling. You get a montage of Kubrick's photography.11/27/1966 Interview with Stanley Kubrick [1:16:24] The best feature on this release in my opinion is with director Stanley Kubrick with physicist and writer Jeremy Bernstein, discusses the making of 2001: A Space Odyssey, in this 1966 audio interview. The notoriously elusive director remains true to form, but Jeremy Bernstein (a veteran writer for the &#34;New Yorker&#34;) keeps Stanley Kubrick chatting. He emphasises the importance of problem solving, his relief at not having gone to college, the significance of photography as a training ground for filmmaking and his various experiences on different types of films. He explains how he worked with United Artists using James B. Harris&#8217; money as a completion guarantee, describes the second half of Spartacus as &#8220;a bit silly&#8221;, talks about the nuclear holocaust and denial in relation to Dr Strangelove and says of his comments, at one point, &#8220;You&#8217;re gonna have to fix this up because this is gonna sound crap!&#8221; I was surprised to find that Stanley Kubrick doesn't come off anything like the hard person he would be accused of being in later years. His answers are thoughtful and polite for the most part, and he divulges a bit more information than I expected. This is a true gem for Stanley Kubrick fans that shouldn't be missed and I think that the 76 minutes of this interview are as fascinating an insight into Stanley Kubrick as I&#8217;ve ever encountered and I enjoyed it immensely.Theatrical TrailerFinally, 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the great classics of cinema and it is a most welcome addition to my growing library of Blu-ray releases. I'm a huge massive fan of this classic film, personally, so this was a release that I've been eagerly anticipating for quite some time. Fortunately, this Blu-ray release from Warner doesn't disappoint in any way. The film has been given the utmost of attention and the resulting video quality is of reference grade. Audio is also similarly spectacular, if not slightly limited simply by the film's age. Warner has also really opened up the vaults with the disc's excellent supplementary features. In the end, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a must own title and this Blu-ray release earn my highest recommendation!Andrew C.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A11WB8VTPLSBUU	"Andrew Czernicki ""Living it up in Chicago"""	After reading the book by Arthur C. Clarke entitled 2001: a space odyssey, I was soon informed that there had been a movie made based on the book.  Since I was fascinated and interested with the ideas and plot of the book, I decided to rent it.  Now, three years later, I own the movie, book, and all the sequels.  If you don't know what that means to me, I'll explain. Simply put, I found 2001 to be one of the singularly most interesting books ever, whether science fiction or not, and the movie and DVD are just as good.  Though the movie version departs a bit from the book (Jupiter is substituted for Saturn, Planet-Io La Grange subbing for Iapetus {Japetus}).  It is still very fascinating.  Not just that, but most sci-fi movies of the time were concerned with the threat of some little green men with space-ray guns invading Planet Earth, and suddenly we're the ones seen invading (at least in my opinion) another little world.  Or, as Jupiter is, another big, very big, world. Certainly Stanley Kubrick understood what Clarke was trying to portray in the book; the sheer length of time it takes to travel from point A to point B in the Solar System, and the intelectual curiosity of Man.	4.0	2001 Scores big on the Sci-Fi Charts!	2001-04-15	2	1	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AARB8793FAKQA	Andrew Jon Abrahamson	I did it.  I finally saw 2001.  I should have seen it years ago, but hey, sometimes things just work out different.  So, yes, it is a work of art from Mr. Kubrick.  The films cinematography is absolutely stunning, and taking into consideration the years that have gone by since filming it, it still holds up well against films being made right now.  The special effects, also groundbreaking and totally organic in film(which is the highest compliment they can be paid).  I also found the film to be very though provoking and wonderfully open for interpreptation.  The scenes between HAL and the two astronauts are simply stunning.Now, I have a few complaints.  I just couldnt get over the fact that the film dragged so poorly at times and seemed entirely under edited.  If perhaps just twenty minutes could be pulled off the films entirety, and in particular those final dream scenes, I would be a happier man.  It was this snail like pace that had me loosing myself into too much thought and eventually pondering things that had nothing to do with the film.  Bad stuff, especially for a film hailed as being so deep and introspective.In the end its a great picture, with fantastic imagery and extremely powerful engrossing moments, but just a tad bit too much and too long.	3.0	Gorgeous, Thought Provoking Movie	2005-07-09	6	2	4
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2SWW3OWEGLN2O	Andrew Kear	2001 is the first purely visual mainstream Hollywood film. Its unorthodox narrative caused quite a sensation in 1968. Some have said it was the first music video where the story is told through visual rather than traditional narrative means. This may explain the films initial hostile reviews. Critics usually go into a film with a preconceived notion on how a film is supposed to be setup. 2001 broke the rules of traditional cinema and in turn gave future filmmakers the ability to break the rules.We all know the basic premise of the film. The obelisks basically follow mankind through its evolutionary path. It begins with primitive man discovering the obelisk and learning to produce tools. In one of the most innovative scenes of the film one of the primitive men throws a bone in the air and it turns into a spacecraft. An average director simply would not have come up with such a clever transitional scene. Eventually, astronauts find the obelisks on the moon, which takes one of the lead characters on a journey to the next level of existence.I think most people know what happens in the rest of the film. What really interests me about the film now is how optimistic it was about the future in 2001. Everyone assumed there would be advanced computers by 2001, but none of them are capable of intelligence, and certainly not one capable of self preservation. Hal 9000 shows one of the most basic human traits, which is survival, and also commits the first homicide by a computer. Gradually, Hal has to be lobotomized and we watch as his thinking becomes increasing simplistic. Hal is basically neutered into a simple PC.Today we are far from artificial intelligence that 2001 predicted. Of course the space travel in the film is so beyond what we have today that the film might as well be entitled 2050. The way things are going I don't think mankind will be back on the moon by 2020. Kubrick's elaborate space station makes the current space station look like a disjointed erector set. The shuttle in the film suggests that flying to this orbiting hotel is common place as commercial airline flights are today. Kubrick did get the video telephone right, but most of the other technologies seen in the film are still science fiction. Of course, we are not even close to having a moonbase.The truth is most science fiction paints an overly optimistic picture of the future.  Most science fiction creators can't help but to be optimistic. It is this optimism that all humans strive for.	5.0	The future looked brighter then	2011-10-25	4	4	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3HP7JU4ZORF52	Anja Rebekka Schultze	I have loved science fiction and fantasy since I was two years old. When I was 11 years old I tried to watch 2001 A Space Odyssey, and it is the only science fiction film I never finished watching as a little girl, the movie just got to boring, and that is saying something as I ate up anything with space ships. However now an adult woman of 28 years I decided to give this movie another watch, thinking that I was probably to young to get it when I first tried to sit down and see it. So last night me and my hubby sat down with 2001 on blu-ray.I have to say that I have mixed feelings about this movie. Let me take the good first. When you take into account that this movie was made in 1968 the special effects are amazing, the space station, the space ships, the spinning interior of the main ship, all of it is just amazing, the effects even hold up today, they are just beautifully done. The movie is set to a score made up mostly off classical music and that all combine to create a beautiful film.The story is very original and it is more than a simple let us go out in space and look for aliens tale, the film is deeply philosophical. I could not really give you a summary of the film without spoiling it, and it is really more about the journey, you would have to experience the story for yourself. The characters are very well done and feel very real, and off course you have Hal, perhaps the most iconic AI character off all time. This is both a classical science fiction space tale, and a philosophical discussion about evolution, morality and even God.Ok now to the bad. Some scenes go on forever. There are several space docking sequences which take many minutes to complete, the whole first of the movie is composed of men in monkey suits dancing around that that just go on forever and at the end of the movie there are a nearly 20 minuted acid trip which is nothing but lights and sounds swirling around. I lost patience with the film and stopped caring about the plot, there is a limit to how long I find it interesting to watch swirling lights or a pen floating in zero G.Another problem with 2001 is that allot of time is spent with a scientist, we learn that he has a daughter he is estranged to, his character is really developed, and then he is just discarded and never seen again, a third problem with the movie is that it was made alongside a novel and without it there are things which are really hard to understand.I have one big issue with the blu-ray as well. In the middle of the movie there is a five minutes section where the screen go dark and there are just music playing. This was when the movie took a break in the theater so people could go buy more popcorn. However why keep this in the blu-ray, that long part where the screen is black should have been cut.I can not be to hard on this film as it is a classic, and it is a masterpiece. The visuals are amazing, and the movie do make you think. The film should have been shorter, it is not a film to watch if you do not have allot of patience. Also if you expect traditional science fiction you will not get it here. However if you are looking for an art film with a plot then this might just be the movie for you.	3.0	Art film with a plot.	2010-12-19	10	6	4
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2PA1GFE3HWHUI	Anna Grunseth	This film is undoubtedly the greatest ever made.  From the technical wizardry of top-notch special effects (especially for the late 60's!) to the deep and epic plot, 2001 really shines.  Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke are two of the greatest visionaries and artists of our lifetimes.  Their combined efforts on this movie / book have made filmmaking history.2001 has a perfect blend of music and imagery, all symbolic of the various layers of themes within this movie.  This beautiful film is also technically and scientifically accurate.  2001 puts the science back in science fiction.  The way the film is shot and progresses really gives a feel for space travel.  All this more than a year before men even landed on the moon! (and I must say that given the time period which the film was shot, the lunar sequences are AMAZING).To date, I have yet to see a science fiction movie to even come close to attaining the calibre at which 2001 stands.  Come to think of it I have yet to see any other movie that attains those standards. (though Kubrick's other works come to mind... :) )	5.0	Epitome of film	2000-08-28	0	0	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3LTZGHZBBBQX0	Anthony L.	"I watched 2001: A Space Odyssey for a number of reasons:1. Christopher Nolan, one of my favorite directors, hails it as one of his favorite films.2. It is considered to be one of the greatest, most influential and beautiful films ever made.3. I wanted to write a review on the subject.So anyhow, I watched it. And I was to-ta-lly blown away.Here are thoughts, criticisms, and notes on the film, 2001: A Space Odyssey:WARNINGthefollowingreviewcontainsspoilersinthesectionsindicatedWARNING1. The Opening SceneThe opening of 2001 is, in my opinion, one of the greatest ever filmed. The iconic music (See: The Theme below) plays as the sun rises above a planet, and the words: ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" show on the screen.  Someone on YouTube commented that even if the whole movie was just the opening scene, they could have walked out of the theatre--feeling they had gotten their money's worth.I totally agree!Thankfully for us, there is more...much more!2. The Dawn of ManThis is my favorite scene in the film. Why? It simply has the most action and plot (See: Criticisms below). It revolves around a clan of Australopithecus in Africa, apparently 4,000,000 years ago!  The ape-men live a hard life: scrounging for food, defending themselves from leopards, and being driven from their water-hole. I'm not going to spoil the plot for you but allow me to bring your attention to one scene. In my opinion, this is the greatest scene in the film, and one of the greatest, most iconic film scenes of all time!I speak, of course, of the Tool-and-Bone-Scene (just made that name up)An ape (Moon Watcher, in the book) approaches a pile of dry bones. Picking one up, he wields it as a tool. Bones fly, music plays, wild pigs fall dead and skulls are smashed in a scene that sends shivers down my spine (in a good way).3. Special Effects:For a film made 50+ years ago, this film has flawless special effects. Impeccable. Perfect. Faultless.Truly, endless scrutiny will find nothing wrong with the effects. Endless scrutiny will just further my opinion that great cinema can be achieved WITHOUT CGI.(George Lucas, James Cameron, and Michael Bay, I'm looking DIRECTLY at you.)Stanley Kubrick, how you achieved this is beyond me. You were a perfectionist, a control-freak, and a brilliant mind in cinema. There will never be anyone else like you, ever again.4. HAL 9000HAL is part of the reason this film is so famous. A state-of-the-art computer, whose ""face"" is just an unblinking red eye, serves as the antagonist of the film.And he's a damn good one, too. I can't go into detail because that would spoil the film for you. Just remember, HAL steals every scene he is in, is one of Kubrick's greatest inventions, has influenced everyone from Hannibal Lecter to Apple's Siri, to and is part of the reason YOU should watch 2001.Memorable quote: ""My mind is going. I can feel it.""5. CriticismsAll movies, even the greatest, have their cons. Even Classic films. ESPECIALLY Classic films. No one can deny Citizen Kane is a truly good film, but who'd watch it for fun? To me, 2001 has but one con, but it is a big one:2001: A Space Odyssey is abominably slow.- The first section: (The Dawn of Man) is not slow at all. It is marvelous.- The second section: (Moon) moves fast and has lots of great dialogue--something you begin to miss in the latter half of the film.- The third section: had scenes so long one could skip 5 seconds ahead and the camera had not moved, still, it had some dialogue. The scenes with the ""pod"" were the slowest in the film. The pod was so slow!- The fourth section had no dialogue, which is sad, but that is made up for by some of the most amazing, moving scenes I have ever witnessed in a film.Also note the lack of dialogue. This is not really a con. Stanley Kubrick intended 2001 to be a visual experience (The Ultimate Trip), not a verbal experience. Still, for about 30 minutes, all you hear is Dr. Bowman's breathing, nothing else. (This is also intended--space is perfectly silent)Plus, (and this also isn't really a con) you will NEVER, EVER be able to fully understand, comprehend, or wrap your mind around the mind-blowingly wondrous ending of 2001: A Space Odyssey. It's impossible, trust me.So stop trying!6. ConclusionThis is what Rotten Tomatoes has to say:""One of the most influential of all sci-fi films -- and one of the most controversial -- Stanley Kubrick's 2001 is a delicate, poetic meditation on the ingenuity -- and folly -- of mankind.""And this is what I have to say:With 2001, Stanley Kubrick has created a visual masterpiece. It is a film that cannot be described in words; it must be SEEN to be experienced. A beautiful, moving, voyage of wonder through space. 2001: A Space Odyssey is truly...the Ultimate Trip....P.S. Watch this film, I hope you enjoy as much as I have. Also, LIKE this review, POST a comment, and READ my other reviews."	4.0	Consider THIS Review on the Sci-fi Masterpiece...	2012-07-21	6	5	1

I watch ""2001"" mostly to get those sublime spine shivers--it is the scenes approaching the appearance of the monolith, and the scenes with the monolith itself, that do it for me, with Ligeti's rising, complex music and the perfect cinematography that screams ""these are symbols!"" and works.If ""2001"" doesn't get you off, no bother.  We may all share more than 99.9 % of our DNA with each other, but we can't expect to agree on such really trivial matters as whether this movie rocks or sucks, or that other.  I mean, billions of people have found salvation in myths and moods I cannot ken--the Ancient Greek religions transported our ancestors and the cotempores of our ancestors as much as the most sublime themes of our own day, but they don't do it for me or any of my friends.So this is what it boils down to: I like ""2001"" a lot.  It chills me more than anything.  If you don't like ""2001"", that's fine by me.  Instead of arguing, let's all go enjoy those experiences that give us what we need and love, however different our tastes in those might be."	5.0	Well, my friends...	2004-12-23	8	8	0

The  only problem that some may experience is that some of the earlier DVD  release of this movie (i.e. the one in the black case) has problems reading  the second layer of the dual layered disc.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1KNUT2VTGKC9A	Anton Yakovlev (yakovlev@wpi.edu)	While this film is certainly a milestone in global cinematography, I simply wouldn't agree that it's the best film by Stanley Kubrick and one of the best films ever made, especially in the realm of science fiction. First  of all, there is much more symbolism than science to be found, and even  then, a film like Solaris is, in my opinion, is a more accomplished space  fantasy with philosophical overtones. There is much disturbing symbolism to  be found in the film, and it offers endless grounds for discussion and  theoretization. There is no real plot that would connect all the parts of  the film together, and some characters are rather schematic and  undeveloped, but this is not necessarily a curse. It is true, however, that  at times the story gets deadeningly slow and reeks of pretentiousness.  Overall, however, there is no film in the world quite like 2001: A Space  Odyssey, and not seeing it would be a great mistake.	4.0	A fascinating journey	1999-06-16	0	0	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A21M7JSRRQFC0G	A On Amazon	There is no doubt that this movie is some serious art visually and audio-wise. The first time I saw this movie (science fiction class) I wasn't really sure what to think and while I did like the visuals, I did not appreciate it and I knew I would not watch it again. Later on, I decided to give it another try and ende up buying the DVD. I do now appreciate it especially because this film is very well ahead of it's time (late 60's). If you watch it on DVD, you would not think such a film was made in that time...most of the scenes looks more late 80's, early 90's. I mean, pay attention to the detail in the space ship. You almsot wanna visit the place. The music is classic and very famous (you still hear these tunes to this day). Some of the music and noises are a little strange and can be haunting, but I love it. There's also not much dialogue in this film. The film often communicates through the images. You don't see many movies like this nowadays.The film is basically and vaguely about astronauts in a mission in space...and somewhat of a story of evolution. You start off with the dawn of man (the beginning with the neanderthals or apes?)Then you get to the mission in space. I'm not going to say the end. I think my favorite scene in this movie is with Dave's interaction with the computer, HAL 9000. It is a very interesting and unusual scene and probably the most memorable scene in the movie along with the psychedelic scene later on (which i will discuss in a bit). I won't give away any spoilers, but I will say that HAL 9000 is an important part of the mission crew as well as the movie itself. As for the psychedelic scene, it is pretty intense and I think it is pretty interesting and nice to look at. The first time I saw this scene, I laughed at the shots of Dave (one of the astronauts)within it, and it still brings me a few chuckles to this day, even though it's not supposed to be funny. It is basically up to you to interpret the symbolism of this scene. I think a lot of stoners would love it, haha. There is also the monolith, which is one of the highlights of the movie. Pay attention to it and think about what it means.This movie reminds me a lot of Sphere. If you liked Sphere, you may like certain points of this movie. I do have to say watching this movie requires patience...or unless you have the dvd remote nearby you might have to use it. There are plenty who say a good half hour or 45 minutes could be chopped off the movie...yeah I can see that but at the same time I think that would cut away from the visual experience of it. And I caution you, don't get the idea that this is some Star Wars type of space alien science fiction because you won't see any aliens or saber-light fights in here! There's no gore, hardly comedy, no slasher horrors here. It is rather strange, but I think it is a movie that should not be forgotten. Kids under 17 may feel like they are wasting their time watching it. I'd say this is for a more mature audience...and people who can appreciate other genres of movies aside from your average teen, horror and comedy movies. You have to watch it with an open mind. I'd say rent before you buy this one. It may take a while to grow on you. I think it will be quite a while before another movie like this comes out in Hollywood today.	4.0	Visual and Sonic Art	2005-06-27	0	0	0

He just crammed a bunch of things into this movie and kept it vague so people would be confused into thinking he was brilliant. It is I guess, people say this garbage is one of the best movies of all time.This stuff is getting me to wonder if A.I. was made slightly boring at parts in an attempt to emulate Kubrick.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A272ZKIHFDIMWZ	Astronomy Buff	"The screenplay for the film did not follow Clarke's original storyline.  In the introductory prehistoric segment, the main hominid character is named ""Moon-Watcher,"" because of his nightly fascination with our satellite.  He is the one who the monolith reaches first and in whose mind they implant images of tool usage and well-fed hominids.  There is a scene in which the hominids turn on an attacking leopard and, after killing it, mount its head on a stick.  It is this grisly trophy that Moon-Watcher carries across a small stream and brings down upon the head of the rival clan's leader, killing him in the process.  As he stands over the body of the rival, he surveys the scene around him and, in Clarke's prose, realizes he ""was master of the world, and he was not quite sure what to do next.  But he would think of something.""  From this point Clarke moves us rapidly through history  to the moment when Doctor Floyd embarks on his trip to the moon.  At the end of the film, when Dave Bowman returns to earth as a fetus, Clarke uses the identical phrase about Moon-Watcher being the master of the world to describe Bowman's new situation -- Clarke repeats the emphasis.  By learning to use simple tools, the hominids saved themselves from extinction -- a major event in human evolution.  When Bowman is transformed into an entity that can cross the abyss of space in an instant, humanity, represented by one man, has reached another plateau of its evolution.  Simply put, 2001: A Space Odyssey is about human evolution, albeit with some outworldly assistance.  Unfortunately, the film 2010, while entertaining, completely eliminated the illustration of evolutionary leapfrogging Clarke used in his first book when he used Europa and Jupiter as a new Earth and Sun, opting instead to develop a new species in the solar system.  If one is interested (or obsessed) in following this storyline, I would suggest they read Clarke's sequels,  2061: Odyssey Three and 3001: The Final Odyssey."	5.0	Want Interpretation?

Well, seeing 2001 was one of the most moving movie experiences I had  ever had.  It would be fallacious to think I did not know the tale already,  but the incredible scope and wonder of Kubrick's work were more  breathtaking than I had imagined. Not that there is anything wrong with  sex, but some things transcend all that, and the ideas they bring to your  mind make you feel like this whole human race you're involved in might  truly be something special. 2001 was one of those things.	5.0	An Amazing work of Art	1999-07-19	1	1	0

It is a brilliant visionary picture, fully abstract yet beautiful. Complicated yet somewhat simple. The misconception of 2001: A Space Odyssey is that it's boring. I beg to differ: 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the greatest achievements in motion picture. Considering the year it was actually made in, that's not 1968...it was started in 1963 and wasn't completed until 1968. Imagine the painstaking work it must have taken to create the vision possible in 2001: A Space Odyssey, and now imagine...no CGI work! None of the stupid, crappy graphics of today I am unable to savor. What I saw in 2001: A Space Odyssey is purely and naturally done, and 2001: A Space Odyssey is a wonder, a true wonder of the world. What sets 2001: A Space Odyssey from many science fiction films, the picture focuses on what's like to be up in the space and then transports us as if we are actually part of it. Other films would be so abstract and meaningless. Take Blade Runner. It's a movie without a story, without meaning, and without comprehension. On the other side, take Star Wars...it's basically a masturbation of special effects. 2001: A Space Odyssey avoids either side by making this picture to be purely visual without a lot of words. It's like a Rembrandt: you come up with a meaning of it. Undeniably, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a special picture. HAL-9000 is one of the great characters in motion pictures. Interestingly, while improbable at the same time, HAL-9000 represents the same way as the Terminator does: the human's way of giving up the reins of control to artificial intelligence. How damaging would that be? How surreal would that feel like? Stanley Kubrick, although eccentric and methodical, established himself one of the greats through 2001: A Space Odyssey. In a gist, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a beautiful motion picture trip and is easily the best science fiction picture of all time. Nothing comes close.9/11: Birth. Evolution. Mankind. Age. Exploration.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	ANGH6401L9Y0T	"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93"""	"2001 is a book as well as a movie. In this case, however, there is a twist: the book was written after the movie was released. The original upon which the movie was based was a short story called ""The Sentinel"", and Stanley Kubrick wrote the screenplay with Arthur C. Clarke. The movie won an Oscar for best special effects, and in 1968, that was impressive. In fact, it was a breakthrough on many levels.The basic story begins in pre-history, when some very primitive primates suddenly come upon a huge black monolith that makes a very weird sound when they touch it. It seems to have a remarkable effect on the intelligence of the primates, as they go on to discover tools -- and weapons. There's a great dissolve where the bone thrown high in the air by an ape-like character turns into a space ship on its way to the moon. Probably the longest time lapse dissolve in movie history.Of the many things I love about this movie we must include the music. The soundtrack was an album I practically wore out playing, even though it included one piece I really hated: a high-pitched choral work that accompanies the discovery of another of these monoliths on the surface of the moon. But ""The Blue Danube"" is used to great effect for the floating of a space station and the docking of the shuttle from earth in the station, and ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" was the theme everyone now calls simply ""The Theme from 2001."" The music was not only beautiful, it was uniquely matched to the movie scenes.Anyway, after this second monolith on the moon is uncovered, a signal is released from it to the region of Jupiter, as I recall. Anyway, way out there. It becomes obvious that the monolith was planted on the moon to signal to some superior intelligence when the primates they had influenced had evolved sufficiently to reach the moon and uncover the monolith. That is, they were waiting to let us know they existed until we had developed that far.So a major push is on to launch a space ship to discover where the signal from the monolith had pointed. Five astronauts are on board, three of them in hibernation. In charge of the expedition is HAL 9000, which is 1968s concept of what a supercomputer would be like. He is given a personality, of sorts, and therein lies the rub. HAL grows a bit too big for his silicon, and causes a good bit of trouble for the astronauts. (""Open the pod bay doors, HAL."") Nonetheless one of them, played by Keir Dullea, reaches the destination to discover that the monolith floating in space is not merely a three-dimensional object, but a doorway into higher dimensions. After that, you need a lot of imagination to interpret the remaining special effects, or perhaps a few hits on the pipe. Or you may need to read the book."	3.0	An Important Part of Science Fiction Movie History	2012-05-21	6	6	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2JJSCIGPZDWHI	BENJAMIN MILER	1968 was still a year before Man landed on the moon. That was also the year that an American residing in England who went by the name of Stanley Kubrick gave us this wonderful masterpiece of sci-fi: 2001: A Space Odyssey, when Man finally makes it to Jupiter. Sadly, in real life, in 2001, Man hadn't even made it back to the moon, just doing routine space shuttle launches orbiting the earth and coming back in a few days. But back in 1968, everyone had a much more optimistic view of space travel, and so Kubrick decided to do a movie on the subject, with the help of Arthur C. Clarke. While the plot seems thin at times, the best thing to do is enjoy it visually. This movie is a far cry from those silly sci-fi films made some ten years before with flying saucers dangling on strings. The visuals are so realistic than when I first saw 2001 in the mid 1980s, I swore the film was made in the 1980s. The special effects were a lot more real that any sci-fi TV series contemporary to 1968, like Star Trek or Lost in Space. And that's how this movie became a big influence to how sci-fi would be made. There's enough said of this film already, but the one thing I really enjoy is the wonderful psychedelic light show near the end. It doesn't seem to mean anything, just that it's a real trip to see indeed. Douglas Trumball provided the special effects to this film, he's the same guy who also did the effects for Silent Running and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. I understand that 2001 might not be appreciated by everyone. It's not a blockbuster, high-paced Hollywood flick like Raiders of the Lost Ark or any of those other Indiana Jones flicks. It's not another one of those sci-fi flicks where they shoot aliens like it was a video game (Star Wars for example, or its TV counterpart, Battlestar Galactica). This, like Close Encounters of the Third Kind some nine years later, is a visual experience. 2001 does get lots of hype, and for a rare time, it really does live up to the hype. Rarely had I seen a movie so well made, or so much care put in to the visuals. So if you don't mind the slow pace, be sure to give this film a try.	5.0	Well-deserved sci-fi classic	2002-07-03	10	9	1

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AX08QJGPHH149	Ben Riddle	I believe that there is no doubt in anyone's mind that &quot;2001&quot; is a classic for our time, now and forever.Robert Holdstock, consulting editor of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;, published in 1978, describes &quot;2001&quot; as &quot;destined to be the ultimate in special effects movies until 1977's 'Star Wars' exposed it for what it really was: a special effects masterpiece in search of a plot.&quot;I disagree.  To me, &quot;2001&quot; is an excellent example of how one need not have a tremendous amount of dialogue between actors to tell a terrific story.  Wonderful use of classical music is made, of course, and even the heavy breathing sounds heard during Dave Bowman's scenes in outer space can be considered musical if one listens to them correctly.  A movie like this one only comes along once in a lifetime.	5.0	Supreme Space Adventure	2001-05-01	0	0	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A382TU4RHJIPWL	B from America	This film is a masterpiece.  That said, it should've been done with much more respect and quality on digital transfer.  I'm not sure how many versions of this film are out there on DVD.  That is the first mistake, why are there so many?  There should be one definitive set for this film.  I can't stand to see such an important &amp; groundbreaking film (1968!) released on DVD with all the care of &quot;Purple Rain&quot;.Here is a description of the one I own: My review is of the widescreen version that has the picture of the original film poster (the painting of the space station and the departing ship) on the cover.  The top of the cover reads &quot;Stanley Kubrick Collection; Digitally Restored and Remastered&quot;.  It comes in the dreadful, cheap, snapper case (which should have been extinguished long ago)  The special features consist of one (count them, one!) short theatrical trailer and the usuals (languages, scene access, and interactive menus; big deal!).  The redeeming special feature I didn't list is that the film has been remastered and &quot;restored&quot; digitally with a 5.1 soundtrack in dolby digital. So the music should sound great through your stereo.  The feature of an interview with co-writer, Arthur C. Clarke is no where to be found on this version.  Nor is this the version with the 8 page booklet with information of the film.  The 3 1/2 by 4 1/2 senitype collectible card (a small version of the film poster from 1968) is included and the CD itself is colorful. I was told through a certain DVD &quot;club&quot; that this is the latest version of this film on DVD.  My question is: Why did they bother releasing yet another version without special features and in another snapper case?  I honestly don't think you have much of a choice in purchasing the film on DVD right now.  I am pretty sure that you get the exact same disc in the boxed set (which also includes a separate soundtrack cd.)  I hope that some day the film (along with other Kubrick essentials, &quot;Clockwork&quot; and &quot;Shining&quot;) is released with much more extra features, like more trailers, tv spots, interviews with Clarke, cast, and maybe even some input from Kubrick; how about a &quot;making of&quot; featurette?  To give you an idea of how ludicrous releasing a classic film like this in a &quot;bare bones&quot; fashion is - A film like &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; was released with trailers, behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes, stills, and audio commentary!  Another example is &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, another film from 1968 (also groundbreaking) and released on DVD with 15 minutes of new footage, a featurette, trailers, stills, audio commentary, and a collector's booklet, etc. - I rest my case!  &quot;Clockwork&quot; is available in the same manner as &quot;2001&quot;; &quot;Shining&quot; is an exception with a making of featurette, and &quot;Strangelove&quot; has been blessed with extra features.  &quot;2001&quot;  should be redone and by people who have much more appreciation for this one of a kind motion picture.  If you need a copy now this is the best you can get, but I am hoping they will release this and all of Kubrick's films either in separate definitive editions or as a collectible set worthy of actually being called &quot;The Stanley Kubrick Collection&quot;.	3.0	This is a DVD Review, Dave.	2001-09-02	4	3	1

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A986V0LVO1OKU	bigc	An excellent film to watch if you're in the mood for something intellectually challenging.  Why would Stanley Kubrick make a &quot;science fiction&quot; film and why is it unlike any other genre film? Because in contemplating &quot;where did we come from&quot;, his vision takes the film into outer space where the story remains the focal point in spite of the the groundbreaking special effects. Those who check their brain at the box office before seeing a movie will not be able to follow what Kubrick wants us to ponder.As an aside, I must also recommend reading the earlier review by Rob from somewhere in New York. Whether intended or not, this is true comedy. After stating that he's only watched about 20 percent of the movie's beginning, he concludes that people who have watched the entire movie like to act as though they're smarter than him. You can draw your own conclusions, but I will say that I watched the entire movie before offering my opinion here.	5.0	The movie is a true gift	2002-12-25	1	0	1

The screenplay by Kubrick and Clarke is so imaginative that it can be accepted as nothing  less than pure genius. And the F/X! Man, the effects in this film wouldn't  seem out of place in today's days of high-tech computer renderings. Many  have commented how close the moon scenes in this movie were to the actual  landing in 1969.Oh, and as for the plot... there isn't one. Yes, that's  right, this is a movie that forces you to THINK. Imagine that, it puts  forth the questions, and you must provide the answers. There are such big  debates about this film's meaning, and you really just have to ask  &quot;why?&quot;. It has no true meaning, it means what you want it to  mean. Why do you think that Kubrick has always refused to explain  it?That said, I will give one word of warning: READ THE BOOK FIRST. If  you do not then you will in all likelihood be totally confused by it, and  you may very well hate it.	5.0	One of The Best	2000-07-05	2	2	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A23UBSR6IXXX8	"""bivas"""	I was quite young when I saw this movie, but though I did not get the total concept of the film, I thought it was amazing in all of it's glory ... Stanley Kubrick is renowned for his masterpieces but this one takes the cake 2001 : A Space Odyssey is one of those films you would remember for the rest of your life ...The movie begins with Richard Strauss' &quot;Sunrise&quot; so appropriately chosen for the title screen and the under lying theme of the movie ... then it goes onto one of those brilliantly shot sequences called &quot;The Dawn of Man&quot; . Though on the core with reference to the &quot;2001 : A Space Odyssey&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke, a monolith comes from a distant civilization a galaxy far far away which teaches mankind how to really survive... Then from this new teaching a herbivorous creature turns into a hunter using bones as tools ... The transition from the Dawn of Man to the year 2001 is fascinating, when a prehistoric man, throws the bone into the air out of it's joy of gaining victory over nature, which transforms into a space station.The rest of the movie deals with the finding of the machine which is referred to as the monolith on the moon, and the consecutive space mission which sends a AI computer called HAL9000 and a crew of 5 to a mission to Jupiter ...The end transits quite a lot from what Arthur C. Clarke wrote in his book, and shows a different dimension of thought .. where Stanley Kubrick in his screenplay has transformed this monolith into a symbol of knowledge ... and through this shows a very deep philosophy.The set designing of this movie, and the special effects for me is still the greatest ... that shows what people can do with artisitic sense, that is still not challenged by the computer animation of today.  The movie has very little dialogue. There is only 27 mins of dialogue out of the total 2 hrs 25 mins, rest is music; Johann Strauss' &quot;The Blue Danube Waltz&quot;, Richard Strauss' &quot;Sunrise&quot;, and excellent sound effects.In all a treat for the eye, and amazing film, and an eye opener for sure .

It's a 40+ year old movie, but the video looks easily as good as today's films.  This gets an A+ on Blu-ray.This film is a masterpiece in so many ways.  It was considered ground breaking for it's realistic depiction of space travel and living in space.  The special effects were fantastic for 1968.  The effects were to 1968 what Star Wars was to 1978.  If you haven't read the book the story may be a bit hard to follow at times.  I never read the book, so I had to see it a few times before I understood what was happening.  It really is an amazing story though.For those who have not seen it yet, this is not Star Wars.  It's not an action science fiction movie.  The Transformers crowd will probably be bored silly with this film.  It is a very thought provoking movie with a lot of messages and symbolism.	5.0	Classic movie comes out great in Blu-ray	2010-12-10	8	8	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AUR9OG1PGI3Z9	Bladerunner B26354	Without a doubt, 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the greatest films ever made. Kubrick's masterful style is further encapsulated in the genius idea that saying less with more is better. The opening sequences, the backdrops of space with Strauss' Blue Danube, the lack of innocuous conversations means that every word tells. I can imagine the breath being literally sucked out of the audience when this movie was first released, as in 1968 nothing even came close to the realistic depiction of the quiet, vastness of space. This movie was released one year before the Apollo moon landings, and I wonder if some of the people working at NASA derived ideas for the lunar lander based on the beautiful space sequences in this work of art.  No one ever saw the earth from so high above so clearly on the movie screen, except perhaps for the astronauts on NASA's space missions who were really there. 2001 gave us the chance to see what until then was nearly impossible to imagine and to have subsequently been depicted with such breathtaking beauty, depth and imagination.I have no doubt that George Lucas was among the young audience then, and took the whole idea of living (and fighting) in space based on what he saw in this movie. I noticed many similarities with the overhead shots of docking bays, lighting, star fields, moons and planets too common between 2001 and Star Wars to be a coincidence.  That is the overwhelming and lasting impact this film has had on creative minds and intelligent appreciation for the art and science of quality, inimitable film making. How many space movies after 2001 were influenced by the sheer genius of Mr. Kubrick's and Mr. Clarke's work revealed in this awesome film!  A little less I talk, I little more I watch and learn.	5.0	At least 40 years ahead of its Time!	2010-09-04	2	1	1

One of those movies you can watch again and again and notice something different each time. The film editing gives it a slower, classical rhythm while the content is subversive and thrilling. Great date movie, in my opinion. A modern movie that is edited in a similar style is Drive (2011). Definitely not a sci fi flick, but similar storytelling. Not a lot of talking in either.	5.0	Classic, Kubrick's Mona Lisa.	2013-02-16	0	0	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A20IIR0422G3A5	"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold"""	`2001, A Space Odyssey' directed and co-authored by Stanley Kubrick commonly appears on lists of the ten greatest films of all time, so how am I to be so presumptious as to review this icon of filmmaking?I saw this movie for the first time on the first Saturday of its release in a crowded theatre surrounded by several subteens who constantly asked about this and that and the other thing which was happening on the screen, while I was thoroughly confused myself about what was afoot in this psychodelic extravaganza of a film. I returned that evening alone to watch it for a second time, and returned the next day, Sunday to watch it a third time. I believe I also saw it at least twice in the next week. Since then, I have read the book, I have read the Arthur C. Clarke short story on which the book and movie was based, and I have seen it at least ten (10) times since that first weekend.And, I'm still not 100% sure I know everything which may have been on Kubrick's mind when he created this film.For starters, it is a true cinematic experience, easily as important an exercize in film as is Orson Welles' `Citizen Kane', especially since the techniques of the two directors are so different. In fact, I am willing to say that Kubrick's techniques are a lot more original than Welles, as Sir Orson was certainly learning his craft from Sergei Eisenstein and other great European directors of the 1920s and 1930s. If you need any evidence of this, just watch Eisenstein's `Alexander Nevsky'. In contrast, Kubrick taught the world how to do outer space special effects. `Star Wars' would probably have not been the same without Kubrick's raising the bar so high. Just compare the outer space shots in `2001' with those from some of the very best Scifi predecessors such as `Forbidden Planet' and you can see how big a step Kubrick made. And, he made that step by using an uncompromisingly realistic approach to everything about the film.While this realism did wonders for the space shots and the prehistoric episode, it made most human to human dialogue a bit dull by most cinematic standards. Ironically, the most interesting dialogue was between Keir Dullea and the Hal 9000 computer.After all these years, one thing I may be able to add to the exegesis of `2001' is to consider the analogy between the story of the film and the original `Odyssey', which was a much detoured return by Odysseus home to Ithaca from the Trojan War, where he recovered his kingdom by posing as a very old man. I confess that there are much fewer points of similarity between Homer's story and the film than there are with James Joyce's famous 20th century novel. But, we certainly have a long journey thwarted by a godlike computer, and an aging before the return home. And, I suddenly realized that Clarke's novelization of the film adds a touch to the arrival of the Starchild which improves on the parallel with Homer, in that the Starchild arrives to find home (Earth) circled by orbital weaponry from many nations, posed to bring on the final scene from `Dr. Strangelove'. The scuttlebutt at the time of the release of the film indicated that all this was covered in voiceover commentary, and that in the final editing, all this exposition was dropped, letting the visual imagery speak for itself. This, Kubrick has given a generation of cinematic commentators more than enough material with which to expound.Thus, I am really surprised that there has never been an edition of `2001' made with this extra narrative included. It may be that Kubrick simply destroyed it to avoid such an event. In any event, like the Mona Lisa, the Venus de Milo, and Keat's poem on a Greek urn, the exercise left to the viewer is much more fun than the author's spelling everything out for us.A monument in filmmaking history.	5.0	The Movie, The Whole Movie, and nothing but the movie.	2005-09-23	4	2	2
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2OED3PZLE50A5	B. M. Still	2001 is an extraordinary piece of film making, representing an extraordinary vision.  While the actors dressed as chimps at the beginning of the film don't make the grade in respect to contemporary make-up or special effects, in my view, this is a superficial and retrospective failing in a film that soars beyond almost all others in ambition and originality.2001 is nothing less than a vision of the origins and destiny of humanity - and an encounter with a projected future (much of which is yet, of course, to really arrive) where humans are themselves forging intelligence in a God-like fashion, and troubled by the human-like failings therein reproduced.The stillness and starkness of Kubrick's vision has a truly epic splendour about it.  Humanity is framed against eternity and the unknown as the fragile creature that we really are, and yet, we are perhaps ready, suggests the film, for a leap into a previously uncomprehended world.While the ending of the film will probably forever remain contentious and lampooned in many circles as it struggles to represent the unknown, the transcedent, it does succeed in conveying the sense of a change on a scale as epic as that first experienced by the introspecting ape discovering tools at the begining of the film.This film, while as fanciful as any sci-fi film in some of its details, has to be admired for its scope and bravery.  Few other films have ever tackled anything like it, and few other stay in the mind as clearly and as powerfully as this one.	5.0	Epoch making film	2001-08-01	2	1	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3E1UIGSVRQXQ	"Bobby Brady ""Radioman970"""	It's remarkable that a sci-fi film from the late 1960s can stand on it's on among big budget motion pictures over 30 years later.  Indeed, most of today's attempts - Mission To Mars for one - fall flat with no real sense of wonder (even 2001's product placement is more sutle...love the Howard Johnson's aboard the space station).  Imagine a movie maker trying to pitch a 2001-type film in today's brain dead sci-fi market.  There are very little explosions.  No alien dogfights.  No loud rock music.  No hordes of green-blooded aliens being slaughtered. No computer-generated effects (although effects that are still just as stunning as they were in 1968).Many people say it's a big long bore.  They simply don't get it.  And I feel sorry for them.  If you're happy with what is in front of you, what you can see and touch, then that's fine.  But many of us like to wonder about things.  Meaning of Life, the Universe and Everything (was that Douglas Adams or Monty Python that I just quoted?).  Odyssey does that to us.  Instead of bored, we are mesmerized.  When the early man starts beating on the pile of bones, when the astonauts inspect the monolith on the moon, when Dave Bowman takes the long trip across alien landscapes...we are captivated.  I hope the day never comes when I understand everything presented in this movie.As for the DVD treatment, I was not disappointed.  The picture is great for a film over 30 years old.  The sound was also robust.  Kubrick always knew how to use video and audio to create a desired effect in the viewer.  The heavy breathing of the astronaut lets you know how agitated he is.  The silence in the vacume of space.  The high-pitched tones re-create the tension the characters are feeling in the viewer.  There are many masterful camera shots that put Kubrick alongside Hitchcock.  It's a delight for the eyes and the ears.  The DVD includes an interesting press conferance from when the movie came out.  Arthur C. Clarke proves how educated he is.  The trailers are also nice (2001 and 2010).Here's a triple feature for you:  2001, 2010, and Contact!

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3UV4UCCK29AYZ	"Brian A. Glennon ""BAG"""	This is a profound movie. Keep in mind that in 1968 there were no hand-held calculators, no push button telephones, no electric watches, no personal computers, no internet, no stereos, no cassettes but eight-track players, no UHF or VHF television, no word processors, few electric typewriters, virtually no color TV, (Star Trek was watched in black & white), no films of the earth from orbit, no G.P.S., 'transisters' were high-tech!, and man had not yet landed on the moon. The only science fiction movie being played at the time was 'Planet of the Apes' in drive-ins, and also in walk-in theaters with the big 60' x 60' square screens covered with curtains: and the gorilla suits of 'Planet' being the 1968 movie state-of-the-art special effects.So it was in this climate on Sunday April 14th, 1968 at 7:30 pm (I still have my ticket stub) that I walked into the Boston Cinerama on Washington Street, and saw the long, bare, narrow wrap-around screen with the edges coming off the wall. This unique theater contributed to the feeling of depth and mystery.Instead of seeing a pretty good sci-fi movie, I was present at a historical event! The movie: '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) by Stanley Kubrick, was the most awe-inspiring and staggering revolutionary movie ever to be produced. The audience sat entranced at both the shattering (and a little frightening) special effects and the unfathomable cryptic plot of this cosmic saga. The movie was demonstrating technology that had not yet entered society, and the next day college professors ran out and began teaching courses on this film. The film was obviously many years ahead of its time! Stanley Kubrick invented a special lens just for this movie, helped to invent some of the special effects, he made this masterpiece without any CGI or private effects companies to draw upon, and in the process, demonstrated that he was a rennaisance man.In Boston, nobody walked out of this film, and in 1968 the entire audience sat in stunned silence as the unprecedented titanic feats of technology, color, form, and philosophy melded with the hypnotic combination of movement and music. The dazzling special effects succeeded in promoting a vehicle to carry the deep philosophical message regarding man's relationship to the universe and only Stanley Kubrick was able to pull it off with such elegance. In all truth '2001: A Space Odyssey' is no science fiction movie but a philosophical statement. Nothing before or since has ever been like it in movie history. Everything else compared to '2001' is merely a footnote to Stanley Kubrick's accomplishment.Yet 2001: A Space Odyssey does lose something when viewed on the small screen, and a released version had twelve minutes chopped from it (which is equally inane as chopping off twelve inches from around the 'Mona Lisa', or defacing any other masterpiece, to make it fit a smaller frame).The movie: '2001: A Space Odyssey' must be viewed within the context of its 1968 premeire to be fully appreciated as the greatest film ever produced.	5.0	Probably the best movie ever made!	2002-11-15	3	3	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A6WZVL0SRQAPY	Brian Driver	"ANY SPOILERS HERE CAN ONLY HELP YOUR UNDERSTANDING!I saw Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" with a friend of mine when it was first released in April 1968.  I have always been a fan of sci-fi and had been eager to see this film, even given the spate of positive AND negative reviews it was getting.  When this wild, dazzling, brazenly intellectual film was over my friend looked at me and said, ""What the hell was THAT?""My reply was simple: ""I don't know, but I want to see it AGAIN!""And again, and again, and again...I've seen this movie well over 20 times (and before you call me crazy, think of how many times you've seen ""The Wizard of Oz"").  It never fails to excite me, to provoke me, to amaze me.To loosely paraphrase my friend, this is one hell of a movie.  Working from a story by Arthur C. Clarke, Kubrick has constructed a tale told in three acts, consisting of two extremely distant stages of mankind.  First are the man/apes, the first beings about to make the step from animal-kind to human-kind.  These creatures are seen on the primordial barren plains, eking out their existence alongside the other animals who share the countryside, and they exist precariously at the edge of survival, showing little more promise than their four-legged compatriots.  That is, until they find a mysterious black monolith in their presence, and the next day they are using tools in the most human of all ways: to kill.At this point there is one of the most famous transitions of all cinema: a bone thrown into the air becomes a spaceship in flight, and we have now moved hundreds of thousands of years ahead to find that scientists have discovered another monolith on the moon, and we are now on hand to witness the next evolutionary leap for mankind.It is a dense story that makes few concessions for its audience.  It does not spell out its message, and moves its narrative ahead in a manner that expects you to connect the dots, and does not care to make it easy for you.  It's a movie that may leave you scratching your head, but it is a puzzle worth solving, and additionally is one of the most visually brilliant movies you will ever see--and still holds up well six years away from being a half a century old.(I will not address the issues here with transforming the movie to Blu-Ray, as I do not feel qualified to do so.  My comments are on the movie alone, and the classic film that it most truly is...almost always counted high in any list of the top 100 films of all time.)As is reflected by some of the reviews here on Amazon, ""2001"" was not universally admired at its release--any more than it is today.  Even professional reviewers were split; I remember reading a good deal of negative criticism at the time.  They criticized the movie's long running time (two hours and twenty minutes), its lack of dialogue (one hour and forty minutes of it has no spoken words), its lack of star power (its biggest draw is Keir Dullea), its complex storyline (the transformation of mankind by outside forces), and its strange ending (at the end of a lengthy light show, one character seems to morph from an astronaut to an old man to a giant embryo hovering over the earth).  It was only after a few years of its acceptance as a visionary work and the general admiration by its legion of fans that many critics reversed their earlier stands.And, yes, it is all these things.  It doesn't compromise.  Kubrick's film stresses the long boredom of space flight and the isolation of astronauts attempting to make such a journey.  Through its emphasis upon the ultra cleanliness and sterility and just plain WHITENESS of the ship, the trays of multicolored mush that serve as food, the several chambers of other rocket scientists placed within some form of hibernation, the distance one feels when taped birthday greetings arrive from home, even the intricate directions for the zero-gravity toilet, director Kubrick creates a world of pristine loneliness and quiet, monotonous duty.But the master stroke is, of course, HAL, the brilliant computer who has been programmed with a human-like sentience to make him a little more like a companion on the long voyage.  He is indeed ""interested"" in their voyage, ""proud"" of his unblemished accomplishments as a computer and, unfortunately, ""concerned"" when one development might expose him as faulted.  When this occurs, HAL responds, indeed, in a very human manner.I find ""2001"" to be a film that is hopeful about our future, and it is amusing that the date in its title is now 11 years in our past.  But the movie was not predictive; the year was not meant to tell us that such an event would have taken place 33 years later.  No...Clarke and then Kubrick only wanted to make the point that we might be nearing a point where we are ready to consider our future in this universe, that for all of our present advancements we are still little more than creatures on this isolated planet.  ""2001"" spoke to a country that was at that time fully committed to the space program and was only months away from landing on the moon.  It was a movie about quests, and we were fully immersed in one at the time.The evidence here is that this movie glorified the space program, but did not pander.  It is full of extremely long flight and landing sequences, heavy on technological details that display precise science at its best and set to glorious classical music such as Strauss's ""The Blue Danube.""  These scenes were meant to be honest, dutiful, and in their own way, perfect.  And Kubrick was a man who strove for perfection, well known for shooting a single scene fifteen, twenty, even thirty or more times, never satisfied that he had gotten everything the shot could possibly achieve.But with ""2001,"" Kubrick did achieve his master work.  This is a work of near perfection, a transcendent sci-fi of technical genius and scope, and a movie that has stood the test of time.  It is, indeed, one hell of a movie."	5.0	Perfect, Perfect, PERFECT!!!!	2012-03-22	7	7	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3RXFIATM73ZFQ	"Brian D. Zachel ""Movie Maniac"""	"I agree with the review about correct aspect ratios. Panavision, CinemaScope and similar anamorphic processes are wider but not as sharp as 70mm which has an aspect ratio of 2:20 to 1. Ultra Panavision, another 70mm process had an aspect ratio of 2:76 to 1. Both processes were later used as the ""new"" single lens Cinerama films which were made after How the West Was Won which was done in the original 3-strip 35mm process. Mike Todd, who was one of the original members of the Cinerama corporation sold his interest in the company to form his own company which ultimately developed the Todd-AO 70mm process which came close to duplicating the viseral effect of Cinerama. Super Panavision was developed later to compete with Todd-AO using similar lens technology. But as most of us film buffs know...most people don't care. If anyone has seen the Blu Ray disc of How The West Was Won in the smilebox process you'll get an idea of how Cinerama was supposed to look. It would be really great if some of these 70mm films were treated with the smilebox process giving people the choice to watch the film as it was meant to be seen on a deeply curved screen. I did get to see 2001 in 70mm on a deeply curved Cinerama screen and it was amazing. It appears that the days of movie showmanship are long gone."	4.0	Aspect ratios	2008-11-24	4	4	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A141HP4LYPWMSR	Brian E. Erland	"Stanley Kubrick's `2001: A Space Odyssey' released in '68 stands as one of the seminal cinematic triumphs of the twentieth century. It was the perfect film for the sixties hippie generation, breaking all the established rules defining what a film should be. The dialogue is minimal, the storyline vague and the ending unexplained. As for the cast, well the cast remains undeveloped and one-dimensional throughout. They're of no more importance then the tribe of monkeys we see at the beginning of the movie, their only reason for inclusion being to move the script forward. Only one character, Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) is of importance and that importance is defined not by who he is or what he's doing. He is only important for what he will become.The star and focus of the film is a large, black slab of glistening, rectangular metal of unknown origin. I call it metal for lack of a better term, for this impersonal, resonating Monolith symbolizes something far beyond human understanding. It is the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last of all that exists in the physical universe. This is the subject matter of the film. It is a puzzle within a puzzle, a mystery within a mystery and it is left to the viewer to decipher the portent.So exactly what is the allure and fascination many had and still have for this film? I think the reason is because Kubrick somehow tapped into the mythic consciousness of a generation in turmoil and transition and opened the human psyche to a new vision, a ""New Mythology"" leading to a re-interpretation of man and his place and future in the cosmos. Kubrick's vision of this ""New Mythology"" is visual and its signs and symbols are perceived through the mind's eye aided by a hypnotic soundtrack creating an almost trancelike state in the viewer to better incorporate the new, unconventional wisdom.Now thirty-seven years later we are still captivated by the image of the Monolith, the ""Symbol of the Unfathomable."" It's there on Earth at the beginning of time and there floating just behind the planet Jupiter at the end of time as we know it. Remote, Unchanging, Transformative, Eternal. The Monolith made us who we are, and controls what we are yet to become. Is it all nothing more than an ongoing evolutionary process, or is it Divine Intervention? That is the ultimate question posited by the director that we are left to ponder through infinity. Yes, Stanley Kubrick intentionally or unintentionally captured something on film that had never been done before and probably will never be done again. That's what makes `2001: A Space Odyssey' one of the essentials."	5.0	The Enigma of the Monolith  ~  Evolutionary Process or Divine Intervention?	2006-07-13	3	3	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	ATEDH3O9LN5AR	Brian Walters	"Stanley Kubrick made films which were imaginative and which stretched technical boundaries. But time and again (the notable exceptions being ""Spartacus"" and ""Dr Strangelove"") they had badly-flawed story lines. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is such a film. So taken is Kubrick with the spectacular flight scenes, with the technical minutiae of the docking of space craft, and with imagining how space travel might be, that the narrative drive is lost. The vast majority of viewers find this film boring. Rightly.There are wonderful, memorable images - the tossed bone turning into a space craft, the ""Blue Danube"" playing as the space ship manoeuvres gracefully across the sky, spacemen walking along the interior of the ""wheel rim"" of their spacecraft. But images are the icing on the cake of a film - not the substance. ""2001"" fails to cohere as a single story, despite attempts to achieve this. The characters change from vignette to vignette, and the audience is frustrated by not knowing - even at the end of the film - where it is all going. The vignette involving the computer ""Hal"" becoming rogue is by far the most gripping, and this should really have been made the spine of the whole film. As it is, there is no spine at all, just a series of discrete vertebrae.While we might marvel at Kubrick making this film even before humans had walked on the moon, and whilst we might be dazzled by his technical brilliance, for the most part we will not enjoy this film because it lacks the central quality every film should have: a good story."	2.0	spaced out	2007-01-06	15	1	14
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AJCA6SB6MSP9H	BrokenArrow	This really is an incredible movie experience.  I would love to see it again at a movie theater.  Kubrick (in the 1960s) set out to make an intelligent movie about the evolution of man and his place in the universe.  It begins with ape-men living (more like existing or simply surviving) in a harsh African setting 4 million yrs ago.  Mankind then evolves on earth and takes his first steps into space beginning with the moon.  On to Jupiter and then another place or dimension.  Kubrick leads us to examine and think about the vastness of space, the role of technology in man's life, our place in the universe, our future in the universe and more.  From nothingness, to ape man, to evolved man, to space man, to star baby, to who knows what.  It really has been an incredible journey starting 4 million yrs ago.  Where will it all lead.  Will we (man) destroy our earth?  Very possible.  Or will we somehow overcome our collective foolishness?  Doubtful.  But there is always hope.  However, I do not think technology (the HAL 9000s) is going to save us.  I particularly liked the way Kubrick introduced an ET &#34;force&#34; in the movie with the mysterious monoliths.  A great idea and concept.  I think this movie works as well today as it did in 1968.  Watch it and think about our progress since 1968.

However, the Blu-Ray issue seen on a large screen (46"" at a distance of 8  to 10 feet) does begin to suggest how achingly beautiful this film originally looked to me.  The processing of the disc is everything I could have hoped for.  Warner appears to have given the loving attention this picture deserves.The creepiest parts of the picture were all the product placement brands that are no longer with us:  Pan American (the shuttle in orbit), The Bell System (vision-phone), Howard Johnson (Earthlight hotel) and RCA Whirlpool (on the food warmer) --  this last readable only in the blu-ray.I also appreciate the overture of Ligeti's music presented with a black screen instead of some still shot with ""Overture"" written across it in big letters (I suppose for the sake of those viewers who would panic at the sight of a black screen and immediately begin adjusting their tv's).In the Cinerama  theater, the curtains were drawn across the big screen and the overture came from behind them while the house lights slowly faded.  When the theater was totally dark the curtains were quietly pulled and the MGM stylized logo filled the gigantic screen.  What a show!

Back then, I could not grasp the true meaning(s) of the film, but Stanley Kubrick's visually stunning sci-fi odyssey mesmerized me while the chilling Monolith gave me goosebumps, particularly thanks to the eerie Ligeti choral work that served as its &#34;voice&#34;. As I grew older, I realized that the film is not just about the quest to discover the nature and origins of the Monolith but a deeper look at man's place in the universe and our own quest for meaning and truth. Even then, this is like a visual Rorschach test that seems to allow for different interpretations the older I get. Regardless of whatever debate you might want to start over its meaning, the film is still beautiful to behold and lose yourself in.

I also think it's amazing that the  NEGATIVE reviews are not picked as &quot;helpful&quot; simply because  someone disagrees with them!

ANZIULEWICZ ""Chuck Anziulewicz"""	"In the summer of 1969, when I was all of ten years old, Mom & Dad bundled all us kids into the white Oldsmobile stationwagon and drove to the  Rockville (Maryland) Drive-In to see ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" I  didn't know much about the film, but as a budding sci-fi fan I was already  champing at the bit to see it. Needless to say, ""2001"" rearranged  my universe. I can't say I understood the movie completely at the time, but  I do recall talking my parents' ears off about the film during the drive  home.""2001"" is personally my favorite movie of all time. I've  seen it more times than I can count, purchased the soundtrack several times  (vinyl and tape wear out, you know), read Arthur C. Clarke's novelization  several times, and read every other piece of literature about the film I've  been able to get my hands on.And recently my partner Greg purchased  this ""Stanley Kubrick Collection"" DVD from Amazon, and it was  just last night that we sat down to watch it on our new 32-inch TV and in  5.1 digital sound. What a treat! First of all the print is about as  pristine as anything I've ever seen; this movie probably looks better today  on DVD than it did in many suburban movie theatres back in 1969. I was  immediately struck my how sharp the image was, especially the clean lines  of the monolith that appears mysteriously amongst our australopithicine  ancestors 4.5 million years ago. While watching this film last night, Greg  lamented the fact that kids today who grow up on nothing but CGI effects in  science fiction movies may never have a true appreciation for the fine art  of model-building; the Orion shuttle, the Discovery ship and its attendant  space pods, are stunning examples of elegance in design. The Aries 1-B moon  shuttle looks like it ought to have been built and flying by now. The  docking sequence with the rotating space station, to the oddly appropriate  strains of ""The Blue Danube Waltz,"" look just as clean and modern  as anything being filmed today.The pop cultural impact of  ""2001"" cannot me overstated. Is it any wonder that over 30 years  after the film's initial release, Richard Strauss' tone poem ""Also  Sprauch Zarathustra"" is still associated with space travel?""2001: A Space Odyssey""  was released at a time when there was still a huge sense of wonder and  optimism about space travel and exploration. Alas, in the intervening years  shifting economic, political and military priorities have eroded much of  that wonder and optimism. I wonder if any of us will ever again be able to  look up at the stars with as much hope and exhilaration as we had when  ""2001"" first hit the screens."	5.0	"Sci-Fi filmmaking was never the same after ""2001"""	2000-08-29	294	265	29

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AKV2BGUT50B1X	Carl Robinson	"2001: A Space Odyssey is Stanley Kubrick's triumphant film adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's novel of the same name.  The work is a stunning, overwhelming, visual and musical experience.The story itself is both simple, and complex.  An alien force leaves a black monolith next to a band of early humans who seem to gain increased intelligence.  They use this knowledge to help with basic survival.  The movie shifts to the moon, where another monolith is discovered.  It is deliberately buried and when exposed, sends a radio signal to Jupiter.  The story then carries to the adventures of several astronauts and their mission to Jupiter-where they find a third monolith.One can presume that the monoliths were left through the solar system to monitor mankind's development from an primitive ape to a space traveling, intelligent being.The complexities of the story begin to intensify at the discovery of the second monolith.  A find by modern man of a totem clearly left by alien life becomes the charge of The Establishment-who cover up the find and send Dr. Hayworth to investigate.  Throughout the investigation, Hayworth moves with a calm, soulless, bureaucratic efficiency.  Later the astronauts behave in the same emotionless way.  Dialogue is minimal.The soulless actions of the main characters contrasts the deep spirituality of the film.  The spirituality is plain to see, but it is so deeply woven into the images and themes that it can be interpreted many ways.  A simple interpretation is that humanity is moving along a path from the apes to something so much more.  It is a quest to find God, to be born again, to become Nietzsche's ""Superman,"" to unlock the great mysteries of the cosmos. Standing in the way is a computer-a technical creation of man.The movie isn't about the exploration of space-it is about the exploration of the soul."	5.0	2001: A Spiritual Odyssey	2013-03-13	2	1	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2S9IG3Q8GF23B	Carol A. Wolf	"It is hard to review your favorite movie of all time, especially one that relies heavily on existentialism. Kubrick's beautiful 2001 is a bold movie. Opening with many minutes of darkness, with Also Sprach Zarathustra creeping in, the viewer realizes there in for a unique journey.The movie opens with the evolution of man kind; a group of apes that discover tools; the beginning of war, two groups of apes that fight with there newly discovered weapons over a watering hole. This is a thirty minute sequence with no talking, no voice over. The movie is split into four different parts, with Dr. Bowman's group of astronaut's going on a mysterious journey being the main part of the story.As previously stated, there is very little talking. There is many scenes in space that will have classical music playing, classical songs that are very well known because of this movie. At one point a astronaut goes to fix a ship with The Blue Danube Waltz playing, and it almost narrates what the astronaut is doing. The top comments on "" The Blue Danube Waltz"" video on youtube are both about 2001, and almost all videos for Also Sprach Zarathustra are the scenes from 2001.On a technical level there is almost no arguing that this is the most technically sophisticated movie ever. Space looks extraordinary and the sets are marvelous. In Parts Two and Three you can't help but just be amazed by the spaceship, the black void outside, and even small things, like the space suits. The camera angles are amazing, especially in the climax in Part Three.For what little talking there is, the script are some of the finest in the history of cinema. HAL is an amazing character and acted with such a monotone voice it almost has the opposite effect of monotone. Keir did a great job with Bowman, but is given very little screen time, due to the nature of the movie."	5.0	2001: A Space Odyssey	2011-05-22	5	5	0

We're in the audience in complete wonder, but the characters in the film are completely indifferent to what we find awesome.  The future is cold in Kubrick's vision.  Everything has grown more precise and calculated.  The ending is  something amazing.  The whole movie is so graceful and beautiful and  stylish.  I have a tough time deciding which movie is my favorite, this or  Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove.  Some movies give you goosebumps, 2001 takes you  beyond that.	5.0	Something wonderful.	2000-04-05	1	1	0

The book explains these things much better, because you can get inside the characters' brains.  But what was the director supposed to do?  Provide voice-overs for the apes?  That would have been lamer than lame.Anyway, once the basics are understood, you can enjoy the brilliant use of the classical music like ""The Blue Danube"", marvel at the amazing camera shots and that famous jump-cut that takes you from prehistoric times to the space age.It's a sci-fi classic which should definitely be viewed.

But I remember it very well.I remember how excited I was that the world was going to change that much- space flight!  video phones!  artificial gravity!  a talking computer!  whew.  Of course, it hasn't all happened that way, but it's a very nice, credible view of the future based on the past as seen from the vantage point of 1968.The silence of space had a very deep impact on me.  I'm a lover of silence so I thought I would be very comfortable with it.  The monolith was appropriately mystifying.Oddly, I've seen this movie exactly once.  I'm looking forward to actually seeing it in the year it attempted to portray.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A6DOCZ10B7JAJ	"C. Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere"""	"2001:A Space Odyssey is an absolute marvel to behold.  I doubt there is a more pure visual film in existence.  It was released 40 years ago, and it still sets the standard for any sci-fi films to follow.  It gets better with each viewing.But it's also easy to understand any criticism.  This movie is slow-paced with very little dialogue.  It relies on some theories of evolution that some might have qualms with.  Plus it advances with an allegorical complexity that is not always easy to decipher.  Here's my interpretation--It explores the very essence of life, manifesting first somewhere way back through the layers of our existence.  In this pre-Cambrian timeframe, some hairy ape-humans make a startling discovery--a bizarre, rectangular shaped object or monolith.  This vast statuesque piece seems most likely extra-terrestrial.This entire opening scene is supremely odd.  These creatures harness a distinct inclination for violence, which notably reflects our current tendencies.Then the story abruptly takes a gargantuan leap through time and space, to the year 2001.  It is amazing the imagination and the foresight this film envisions.  It shows the spaceship crew in orbit using hi-tech computers, debit cards, and picture phones.  Granted there are some things a little far-fetched, but still it's an incredible visionary semblance.Soon there are dillemmas introduced that are relevant in real life.  Lies, government cover-ups, people becoming prisoners of truth.  Plus we're introduced to  one of the most evil, calculative villans ever--the supercomputer named HAL.  BTW, that name is an amalgam of ""heuristic"" and ""algorithmic"", the two main processes of learning.HAL is designed to navigate the ship and keep the crew safe, but inevitably it turns against them in terrifying fashion.  The desperate plea ""Open the pod bay doors HAL"" strikes a horrific nerve as the men all seem doomed at the hands of their own invention.Kubrick does such a great job with this screenplay, which was adapted from Arthur Clarke's short stories.  He doesn't feel the need to explain everything or fill in the blanks with pointless gibberish.  Plus the camera work is absolutely phenomenal.  There are people often times apparently defying gravity, it is mind-boggling how these feats were shot.  It all has Kubrick's cold, antiseptic feel with vibrant contrast of colors.  AND THE MUSIC!?!?!  It escorts, sways, and entices the viewer through this wondrous exploration of space.Now, the end of this story is up for much debate.  A common interpretation is that a mortal man embarks on a journey, both physically, mentally, and spiritually, which changes him forever.  I like to think he takes the next step of evolution, becoming....?the perfect creature..."	5.0	Possibly the grandest, most transcendent achievement in film history	2008-04-13	33	30	3

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1ASCECH3KOZ3P	C. Gardner	Stanley Kubrick meant 2001 to hit viewers in the subconscious. Don't come to it expecting conventional narrative--there's less than 30 minutes of actual dialogue; the story is told through images. It's slow, patient, and deliberate, giving viewers time to think about the meaning behind what they are seeing. Dissatisfied with the then-current state of sci-fi cinema, Kubrick designed the special effects for this film by himself, from scratch...And 2001 is the only movie set in space wherein an strict attention to the laws of physics is applied. There is no sound.But 2001 is more than just a film--it's a philosophical argument about the human race's relation to Higher Power. On one reading, the human race gets an evolutionary kick-start by an unknown, ostensibly extraterrestrial force; for others, the monolith is symbolic of the Mystery--God. Either way, this genesis involves humans' use of tools (as McLuhan said, who was very big at the time, they are extensions of man...) But what does Kubrick choose as the first tool humans used? A bone. And what does it produce? Two depicted deaths--the slaughter a tapir for food, and the first murder, of another proto-human. Thus man's ability is double-natured from the start. Flash forward half a million years...In HAL, we get an extension of the nervous system--the pinnacle of man's tool-making ability, the nervous system of a spaceship. HAL has been programmed all too well--given conflicting orders, and instructed to lie to the crew about the true purpose of their mission, he becomes rightfully paranoid when the astronauts threaten to disconnect him. His natural drive to self-preservation leads him to kill or be killed (one of the most brilliant murder scenes in cinema--the three hibernating astronauts whose deaths are presented as mere information about their life functions). Man's greatest achievement has failed. Humans are doomed.But are they? In the last moments of the remaining astronaut's life, he recognizes the power which has made him what he is--and with all humility recognizes it (another brilliant moment--Bowman reaching out to the monolith, a quote from Michaelangelo's Sistine Chapel?) and is transformed again.

This is precisely why directors shouldn't be given too much control over a movie. The movie can be summarised thus: Apes, Docking Sequences, Light  Shows.Most of the scenes are long, dull, and pointless. Even Kubrick  himself said he wanted the film to be &quot;enigmatic&quot; (I think it's  in the DVD liner notes). Which to me means he wasn't trying to say anything  with the movie, and was hoping some people would regard it as a work of  art, and hopefully, elevate it to &quot;great movie&quot; status.I'll  admit to being influenced by by Roger Ebert's review when I decided to buy  the DVD; he thinks it is one of the &quot;great movies&quot;. Curse you  Roger Ebert! May you spend the rest of your days watching docking sequences  and stupid light shows!If you've never seen this movie before, don't buy  the DVD right off; rent it or borrow it from someone first so you know what  you're getting into. I figured I couldn't go wrong by buying the DVD  because &quot;everyone&quot; seems to say it's a great movie, classic,  gotta be watched, etc...

If you have a low tolerance for subtlety and prefer to have everything spelled out for you and tied up in a neat little bundle, it ain't going to happen with this film. You get to figure it out yourself. In fact, don't try to figure it out. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. I will probably never get to travel in space. Mr. Kubrick let me feel what is like to be there. The vastness, and the quiet. Pretty amazing for someone who never went there himself. I still get a little sad when HAL is disconnected though.The film gets 5 stars. I was a bit dissappointed in the DVD though. A landmark film like this is worthy of a whole disc full of extras.

I am not going to say bad things about the people who did like this movie, because hey, to each his or her own, but this movie did nothing but literally make me fall asleep on my couch.  I did enjoy the part about HAL, but that was about it.  I think I liked that part because HAL was the only thing I could really feel any connection to in the movie.  It didn't even really bother me when, I think it was Frank, floated off through space, doomed to die.  Keep in mind that I am the sort of person who cries during sitcoms and Hallmark commercials.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3CA5SBRLFJUC1	"Chiclito ""queso anyone?"""	This movie is very obtuse in it's grand meaning. It's one of those moves that's better if you sit back and burn one or eat a handful of magic mushrooms.  In fact, that's how the studio re-marketed it after it was released and had very few seats sold except for those filled by stoners.  They had new movie posters that I can't remember the exact wording but it referenced a ultimate trip or something like that. I suppose if you live in New Mexico where it is legal to have mushrooms it would be very cool to watch a movie like this.  There isn't much dialog and the best dialog belongs to the infamous H.A.L. artificial intelligence computer.  His name is in reference to I.B.M. because if you go up one letter in the alphabet on each letter in the acronoym that's what it spells.  At the time there weren't all these computer hardware and software companies I.B.M. was it and obviously made some like the director Stanley Kubrick paranoid.  In general I love his movies and this one doesn't dissapoint.  He is the director's director.  His films tend to speak a lot though visuals so as to make you interpret the film as much or (in 2001's case) more.The art direction and special effects are way way ahead of it's time.  No Robbie the Robot here.  Except for the lasers the art direction isn't any worse then Star Wars which came out 8 years later.  It's really hard to believe this movie is from the 1960's when you see how great everything stands up to time all limitations considered.As of this writing it's been awhile since I've seen this movie but since Amazon has emailed me 3 times to review it even though I don't have it yet I figured I'd just go with the broader sense then the specifics of this movie.Too me it's getting more and more ridiculous to buy movies with everything on demand and how good it looks but this is one of the few movies that is a mush have in your blu-ray collection. It's always in the top 100 movies list and there is good reason why.  It's a movie that lets you sit back and contemplate without having to engage your attention for every spoken word or miss the meaning of the movie. You can easily watch it with a friend and have a conversation about the film while it is playing (another reason why stoners like it so much).If you like classic cinema, trippyness, thought provoking cinema by one of the masters of 20th century film-making you cannot go wrong with this film but of course I'm biased because I like all of Kubrick's work.  Anyway, Amazon always has it cheap so that should be incentive as well.Buy it and you will not regret it.Edit* By the way I see a lot of reviews saying this movie is too slow.  If you think this is slow don't go anywhere near the far inferior sequel 2010.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A6FK83CLD4S91	Chris Reuling	2001: A Space Odyssey is a science fiction film directed, produced, and co-written by Stanley Kubrick. In this film, Keir Dullea plays as the main character, an astronaut named Dr. Dave Bowman. Dr. Dave Bowman, along with other members on a ship, are sent on a mission to Jupiter, accompanied with an artificial intelligence computer system, HAL 9000. While most of the shipmates are in hibernation to save air and food supplies during the voyage, both Dr. Bowman and astronaut Dr. Frank Poole have many interactions with HAL 9000.The film is a visual masterpiece. Not only with its special effects, but the intriguingly simplistic way the effects were used to create detailed and elaborate images. Keep in mind that this film was released in 1968, so at the time these physical (not computer) effects were remarkable and won many awards, and still hold a special mark for films today. Several scenes have characters walking from floor level up onto walls, since Kubrick was noting the lack of gravity on the ship and station.  Dr. Bowman is shown running in a complete loop for exercise. Eloquent scenery capturing the movements made by the space station and space ship was accompanied with a dramatic soundtrack, which consisted of popular classical music.The most noticeable sound effect used in this film, or lack of, was the fact that no actual sound used whenever the scene was taken outside of the space station or space ship. Since reality acknowledges that fact that there is no sound in space, Kubrick wanted to replicate this feature. To add a dramatic effect, sometimes sounds of only the deep breaths that the astronauts took inside their space helmets were used to increase the feeling of eeriness that outer space truly had. The films score remarkably aided in creating suspense and tension. This sensation was very apparent whenever a mysterious dark rectangular monolithic object was present in the scene. Sounds screeching and polyphonic tones were used. These howling moans and hums gave the impression that this object was obviously special and had a supernatural characteristic about it.The beginning of the film starts off with apes, approximately four millions years prior to the main action of the film (as quoted in the film). The apes encounter the strange rectangular monolith, and then later discover that the use of a heavy bone could aid them in obtaining food more easily by killing animals with greater force, as well as using the tool to fend off enemies from invading their drinking pool. The apes happily celebrate their success in the use of their new tool. This is followed by one of the apes ecstatically throwing his bone above his head, creating the iconic scene of blending the airborne bone into a space station floating in a sky of stars. This symbolized the evolution of man and brought the film to a time when humans had created many more intuitive designs and tools, which led them to achieve getting into the depths outer space.The film was intended to be open ended and was created for the viewer to speculate on the philosophical meaning. Many concepts and theories have been derived, yet Kubrick never led on any correct answer. After viewing the film several times, the attention to small details play an important role in the underlining meaning of the development man has made. For instance, after showing how far we have come in the past four million years as apes to space travelers, the film makes hints that man is moving to another evolutionary phase of existence. Man may have mastered earth, but in space they are yet again inexperienced toddlers only starting to figure out their training wheels. Signs of this are prevalent when the actors portray struggles to walk in space, are shown eating paste and fluid-based foods like baby food, and even a brief scene showing one of the characters glancing at instructions posted to use the bathroom.The end of the film displayed man's evolutionary transformation into a new living form. As Dr. Bowman continued his mission to Jupiter, the strange rectangular monolith was once again present in the background, traveling through space. Bowman uses his pod from his ship and travels to the planet's orbit, immediately being sucked into light. The film uses an elongated portion of special visuals of colliding colors and objects to represent a significant occurrence. The effects promptly stop as Bowman's pod is oddly placed inside of an all white decorated room. Bowman sees himself in a space suit standing in the room, being looked at from the viewpoint of inside the ship. The pod disappears as the viewpoint changes to himself standing outside the pod. He walks into a room and sees what appears to be an aged version of himself sitting at a table eating. The younger version of Bowman disappears as the viewpoint shifts to the perspective of the aged figure eating. At the table, Bowman then looks over at the bed in the room and sees himself lying in it, looking even more deteriorated. The perspective shifts to Bowman in the bed. Placed in front of the bed is the dark rectangular monolith, where the more moderately aged Bowman was originally sitting. The viewpoint shifts one last time to the perspective of the monolith. This perspective looks back at the bed, where only a bubbled star-like baby is hovering, replacing Bowman. The scene changes, and the baby is floating in space and looking back down on Earth. The end of this film is where many people have a variety of speculations. To keep with the theme of evolution as the film already prescribed, the ending represented that man has evolved into a form that is more capable of mastering space. From ape, to human, to a star-formed child, evolution continues as each form of life masters its own capabilities.More than just for a science-fiction lover, this film will be enticing for any person who can appreciate artwork of different forms. This film completely encompasses the beauty of traditional effects that have such a technical side to them, along with capturing the essence of simplicity while making it all so intriguing. Like many of Kubrick's films, after watching this in its entirety, racing emotions will come alive that leaves you left with questions and strong opinions of your own. This film is definitely meant to have a lasting effect. This is the reason so much of Kubrick's work is constantly being referenced and spoofed by many outlets today. So watch the film, you will truly find it to be a great odyssey indeed.	5.0	Evolution of Man	2012-01-20	5	5	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1UU1RLGQWNT0T	Christian Menendez	Critics are not kidding! This is really the most amazing Sci-Fi movie in the history of mankind. That's all I have to say about the movie itself.Now, about the Blu-ray disc. The packaging is the usual standard. The disc offers a top-notch high-definition movie experience. It doesn't even look like it was made in the 1960's. If it wasn't for some special effects, brands (like Pan-Am) and decoration, it could easily pass as a movie made at least in the past decade. I highly recommend a Home Theater system to enjoy it the most.The special features are very interesting.

First, I must say that I am a big fan of science fiction (I am a Trekkie) and fantasy so I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  However, I found great difficulty keeping awake during the film and did not understand why it was considered such a classic. In fact, watching this movie was about as fun as watching paint dry in a cold room.  War of the Worlds (not the one with Tom Cruise), The Day the Earth Stood Still, Forbidden Planet, Journey to the Center of the Earth (with James Mason), and The Time Machine were classic Science Fiction movies.	1.0	too boring	2013-03-06	18	3	15

And it continues to inspire and awe its audience members. The special effects are a quantum leap ahead of its time, and one of the main characters, the HAL 9000 computer, continues to remind us of a future that should have become a reality. And the mysterious black monolith reminds us that we are not alone in the universe. Definately a film that is eeriely and hauntingly beautiful, if not memeorable. The movie that set the standards for science fiction films for years to come. You may not understand it at first, but the more you see 2001 and listen to its classical musical soundtrack, the more you will see in it. Ever since I saw it on NBC's Sunday Night at the movies in 1977, I'm still amazed at how the film has affected the fans of the science fiction genre. Check it out. Just be prepared to ask a lot of questions and get very little in answers.	5.0	A Giant Rorshach Test that is still a classic	2000-10-08	7	6	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3PQMSHDOYHVBJ	"Christopher S. O. Chao ""csochao"""	Some might have criticized the movie for its slow pace pretty much throughout.  But it's not an action oriented movie.  Instead the emphasis is on drama.  The acting on the whole is excellent.  The character development focuses mainly on the 2 crew members of Discovery and their 'interactions' with HAL9000.  The movie does make the viewers believe that a computer can be intelligent and it is precisely because of artificial intelligence that the theme of the movie came about.  A computer wants to take over the control of a spacecraft and its mission from the humans but the humans would not allow it to.  Consequently tension and animosity developed between the humans and the computer.Considering 'The Space Odyssey' was produced in the late 60's, the special effect is very good without computer technology.  But it is the story development that is most praise-worthy.  The main point basically comes down to this:  whoever is more intelligent has the ruling power, ever since the pre-historic age with primates to the present.  It is a must for not just sci-fi movie fans, but for all movie-goers.  It is a pinoeer of movies about space explorations and artificial intelligence that no one can afford to miss!	5.0	It's truly one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time	2003-07-05	0	0	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3JM7ZRLXC18UC	Church of The Flaming Sword	2001 walks the fine line between triumph and tragedy.  I consider it a triumph for just about the same reasons as all of favorable reviewers do:  imaginative storytelling, special effects, atmosphere, subtlety, etc.  However, I also consider it a tragedy because nothing, at least in the science fiction realm, that involves the viewer like 2001 has been made since.  It truly saddens me to see that we have to put with Lost in Space(1998), Armageddon, ID4, etc. instead.Make no mistake about it, 2001 offers the viewer a lot.  But it also demands a lot.  Once you begin to watch, you will be asked to muster every bit of imagination, patience, brain power, and the little part of you that doesn't fear the unknown you have.  There is no wasted dialogue.  Heck, almost two hours are spent where there is no talking at all.  There are no unnecessary characters doing unnnecessary things, which is a welcome change of pace from the cocky heroes who are all attitude and no personality (are you reading Will Smith?).  Every thing you see and hear you really have to watch and listen.  Once you are able to handle the meticulous plot details, you then have to adjust to the cold, humorless atmosphere that belies the film's G rating.  2001 brilliantly plays on our fear of the unknown, be it death or the mysteries of the universe in general.  And as for the plot meaning, I refuse to give spoilers in my reviews even if 100+ reviewers did so before.  I freely admit that I went to the local book store and bought a $.95 dogeared copy of the novelization two days after watching the movie because I simply was at a loss for understanding.Don't expect this to be a fun, thrill-a-minute movie like Star Wars or anything with Indiana Jones (don't get wrong, I love those movies).  And definitely don't expect it to be a braindead Jerry Bruckheimer production where you have the whole thing figured out in the first 10 minutes.  Forgive my crappy classic rock analogy, but if I had to compare this to another work of art, then it would be Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.  DSotM is not a good album if you only want something that rocks or provides a harmless little thrill (unless you like the song &quot;Money&quot;).  However, it is great album that can best be enjoyed by throwing your mind into it.Overall rating:  Drive out to the country on the clearest night possible.  Look up at the sky.  That's how many stars I give 2001.	5.0	Not for the faint of heart or imagination.	2002-01-17	5	4	1

Thanks to those who do this.This was the first time I have ever seen this movie.I thought the video quality was great for a movie this age.  Comparing it to new movies, it wasn't excellent.  I thought most of it was rather dull looking, and I had my 52"" LCD in Vivid mode.  I give it a 9.2 overall, and it was 9.2 throughout the movie.  There were no bad parts.  I didn't notice any grain at all, in any scene.  Towards the end, it looked great.  In some parts, detail was lacking. I couldn't read the instructions for using a gravity free toilet.The Dolby Digital 5.1 was pretty good.  Surround sounds were limited to certain parts - at least I only noticed surround sounds in some parts.  Sub-woofer bass was not real strong when it should have been.The special effects are great for a 1968 movie.  I got a kick out of someone watching a wide screen TV, and the size of the video phone electronics.The movie overall was pretty boring.  I watched it late at night, and almost fell asleep at times.  I didn't really understand the meaning of it, especially the black speaker object.  I haven't done drugs in years, and really wish I would have watched this movie when I did, because I think it would have been great watching it stoned."	3.0	Great Audio and Video for a Movie Made in 1968	2011-06-28	10	1	9
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AERGIVLVUJAY4	"C. J Millett ""movie critic and buff"""	"""Open the pod bay doors please, HAL""The words are spoken by man to machine, at the mercy of its command. The blackness is silent and infinite as the machinery sits motionless, waiting, suspended by zero gravity. But the doors do not open. ""HAL?"" There is no response, only the vacuum of space and the distance between man and his greatest technological achievement, the Discovery One spacecraft; man's great triumph painted against the vast canvas of space. HAL, the onboard flight computer (another of man's great scientific creations), already knows what has been planned in secret. He knows that the human astronauts suspect that the HAL computer has malfunctioned in some way, that there is a flaw in its design. He reasons that it is ""human error"" that has led to the problem, that it has always been human error. If indeed there is a flaw in man's design, it stands to reason that man can create flawed technology. However, HAL was programmed to protect the mission at all costs. When he finally responds to the command, it is with chilling conviction: ""This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it."" Alas, man has ascribed too much power to its technologies. Man has, in a sense, staked its fate and future in its own creations and must now live under conditions which threaten its survival.Stanley Kubrick's visionary film ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is more than a film, really. Most films tell a story with words, with actions, with a development of events that drive us to some conclusion. They ask us to sympathize with characters, perhaps, bring us into situations where conflicts arise, emotions are expressed, actions taken, and things progress in some logical order. In short, most films, even some of the best ones, are satisfied staying inside of themselves, concerning themselves with the here and now of their characters. They do not stand apart, do not look forward or back, do not strive to know anything but what their characters know or need to know for themselves and for their audience. They appeal to our natural tendency to follow something to its end, to organize it subconsciously, from one point to the next, and to put ourselves in place of human thoughts and circumstances.Kubrick, in turn, wanted to create a cinematic experience which, according to him, ""avoids intellectual verbalization and reaches the viewer's subconscious in a way that is essential poetic and philosophic,"" a film that ""hits the viewer at an inner level of consciousness, just as music does, or painting."" His vision is less a film than a grand cosmic yearning, a call to the collective human consciousness, a desire to reach and explore, to ponder where we have come from and where we must go. It is a visual meditation, a vehicle for our deepest thoughts and hopes and dreams. It dares to imagine in a way that no film before or since has ever been able to achieve with as much reflective ambition and urgency. Kubrick, in his obsessive perfectionism, conveys a desperate hunger to grasp, and to compel us to grasp, the path of human thought and ability. His narrative is the very course of human evolution, from its primitive roots to its ultimate place in the vast universe. He does not cater his themes to us because he has too much respect for our intelligence and our ability to construct subjective associations through our visual experiences.So, what exactly has Kubrick really created here? Is this a mainstream cinematic experiment that he has given us? Something that challenges our reliance on conventional narrative structure? Is it a showcase for a new brand of groundbreaking special effects, a visual triumph that would inspire a more realistic vision science fiction for a generation of moviegoers? Or perhaps a cautionary tale, warning us of the threatening possibilities that await us in our modern age of technology? The simple answer would be yes: indeed, it is all of these things and more. Within the margins of the cinematic window, in the span of 141 minutes of film (only 40 of which contain spoken dialogue), Kubrick has achieved the seemingly impossible: he has communicated to us without words what our ultimate evolutionary destiny must be.Ultimately, Kubrick is equally pessimistic and hopeful about the state of our modern age of technology; pessimistic in our potential for self-destruction and hopeful in his firm conviction in the future, as we use these technologies to plot our course through the cosmos. In coming to terms with the dangers of our way of life, he shows us that there can be hope. Through our collective intelligence, our drive to achieve and to explore, we have accomplished great things. We have learned much about the universe and about ourselves, and have come a long way in our evolutionary course. However, as the experience of 2001 teaches us, the journey is far from over. As the reincarnation of man, the Star Child stands as the ideal form of our intelligent human design, the pinnacle of our cosmic destiny. Having evolved beyond the limits of the physical body, the biological human form which Kubrick refers to as a ""fragile shell for the mind at best,"" we stand above and beyond reason.""And if there was anything beyond THAT, then its name could only be God.""...and as that child looks at us, at all of mankind, and smiles, it tells us one thing: this is where we ultimately belong, and maybe someday, somehow, we can get there..."	5.0	a grand cosmic yearning, a vehicle for our deepest thoughts and hopes and dreams	2007-09-05	29	20	9
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2G9GYTSXCSW7S	Clark@mail.kingsleymc.com	2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the greatest films ever to come out of Hollywood.  Be aware that it is not a film everyone will like.  If you hate 'artsy' films and prefer your Science-Fiction to have lots of action,  melodrama and the like then this isn't the film for you.Let me make a  couple comments about the DVD - this is a movie that desparately needs  restored.  The underlying film has scratches, spots and other problems.  You feel like you are in an arthouse watching a decade old patched together  copy of the film.  The film is in space quite regularly but the way they've  digitized things there are numerous digital artifacts that are VERY  noticeable on the black background.  I'm also disappointed in what they  included on the DVD.  There is an interview with Arthur C. Clarke but not  the documentary that I believe the laserdisk version had.Buy it if you  want it right now - otherwise wait a couple years for the *real* edition  for DVD.	5.0	Great film, horrible film stock for the DVD	1999-01-28	0	0	0

Well... eat your popcorn and watch &quot;Independence Day&quot;. This is THE science fiction movie that appeals to the subconscious, the superconcious and the thinkers.  Just like REAL space, this one will raise more questions than it answers. Just like REAL life, there is no plot... only a series of experiences.... all so magificently photographed, the movie would be better described as a &quot;MOVING PAINTING&quot;... and in fact, I feel that way about most of Kubrick's films, most notably &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;.  Sit back, experience, and allow your eyes to shift into that other part of your mind... the part that cannot predict what will happen next... that part that is filled with awe, mystery, fear, lonliness, fascination, wonder, and view a universe that will never have narration to explain it all to you in neat little sentences.This film is a masterpiece to anyone who truly understands the true art of the medium...  visually stunning, sonically mesmerizing, and frame after frame of magnificent beauty.	5.0	The Greatest Science Fiction Movie Thus Far	2002-03-13	3	3	0

I read the film as a comment on the problems of the creation process this time. I doubt Kubrick and Clarke looked at it like that, but they made the film in such a way that you could read that into it. It does make you think, which is one of the things great art does. I have read some comments that this isn't a good transfer. That is definitely not the case. It looked great on my TV and every professional review I've read also stated it was a great transfer.

"Most of the time watching a new movie is kind of strange since it can either be despised or loved on their first viewing and those opinions can change with the subsequent viewing. But whereas most of the time a filmmaker can hit their mark every time or at least consistently, Stanley Kubrick is probably the only filmmaker I know that I've hated the first viewing yet grew to love it on the second viewing. And no more is this evident than 2001, his big sci-fi ""tone poem"" that left many scratching their heads and others having theirs blown away.Around the time of the beginning of man, a strange black monolith is found in the ground. A man-ape is then inspired to pick up a bone and is it as a weapon to win over a water source. Jump several thousand years into the future where mankind is now in space with a base installed on the moon. A scientist is brought on board to study a strange reading on the lunar surface. A ship 18 months later is on their way to Jupiter without a clue as to their mission and have to deal with HAL 9000, a computer who is showing signs of strange behavior.2001 is the kind of film where even after seeing it several times, you probably still won't have a handle on what happens or what it all means. Not that it's confusing due to shoddy story writing but rather it's so open-ended and almost vague that you can almost apply whatever theory you want, from evolution to sexuality (notice the shape of the pods and the ship) and you'd probably be right. However most people remember the film thanks to the non-drug-induced freak out at the end of the film so the film, like any piece of art, is entirely subjective and one only has to experience the film to make an opinion on it, whether you like it or have no clue what's going on.That being said, there is some slight negatives. One is that it does at times feel long but not because of they're boring but since we're so accustomed to having dramatic music and fast cuts, the calmer feel of the scenes almost entirely in silence or bare minimum score might make people feel there's not a lot of excitement going on. But with the convincing effects (I'm still trying to figure out how they have him running in laps around that room) to the meaning, it's kind of hard to turn off. Turning it back on might be another story though since you know the kind of tone it has and you might not be up for a mind warp like this one.There's no doubt there's a cultural and cinema significance attached to 2001 but it's hard watching a ""classic"" as a film by itself and try to ignore the impact it had on cinema and moviegoers. As Steven Spielberg said once, it's kind of hard to turn off a Kubrick film and I found myself completely taken in by 2001 but I'm not sure if I liked it or if I just don't get it.

The film succeeds in myriad little moments that all can relate to. I mentioned Dr. Floyd's banter with colleagues on the way to the monolith site, but there is the ecstatic `first violence' in the murder of the rival man-ape early on. This is a vivid redo of the Cain and Abel myth, and how many of us wish we were so excited that we could toss an object into the air like the murderous man-ape does his bone weapon? Then there is Floyd with his daughter on the space videophone, and a circumspect Floyd being confronted by the smiling Russians. There is the scene where Poole gets a video birthday wish from his parents, and acts ho-hum about it. There is the scene where Bowman must release the recaptured corpse of his friend to outer space to save himself and the mission, and the very fact that, despite being on the mission for his cool demeanor, Bowman hurriedly forgets his space helmet to retrieve the body in the first place shows a deep connection between emotion and action that a didactic spoken resolution could never achieve. There are other moments, as well, but it is in these moments, often dismissed as banalities, that the film actually pulls the viewer into the tale. That so many critics miss these rather obvious connections shows just how attuned to lowest common denominator action, violence, and bluntly obvious things, most filmgoers are. Yet, it's the parallax of this lack against the grandness of the other parts of the film that pulls the mind like taffy between the antipodes. And it is this stretching wherein the film's greatness lies.Another point that goes unnoticed is how and why, if HAL is so `insane,' the computer simply does not turn off all oxygen and heat inside the spaceship when the two waking astronauts sleep? Perhaps one of them needed to be awake while the other slept and would have simply unplugged HAL, but it does seem that HAL's flaws in programming, the ones that make him more `human,' also make him a flawed antagonist. And this is yet another aspect of the film, lost in all the talk of its grandeur, and superlatives, that is lost on most viewers and critics, yet part of the doll within doll within doll like nature of the film that buoys its claim to all time great status. There's simply no doubt, after watching this film, that both it and its creator deserve the label great.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AQMKFCVFE84	"""coyote_137"""	"2001 is a film of subtlety. The meanings of what transpires are not straightforward, and everyone will find something different from the movie's themes.While this may be the case, the questions that arise are some of the most interesting questions that could possibly be asked. The obvious centerpoint of these questions is a black monolith which is in several pivotal scenes. There is no clear understanding of what the monolith is; some people claim it is merely a symbol of evolution, while others claim it is instead symbolic of an alien race or of God. An essay I once read by a professor of film actually purported that the monolith is in fact God Himself.The truth is that Kubrick and Clarke were not looking to force an answer on us, but rather wanted us to find an answer for ourselves, much like other works of art. It is up to us to interpret what the various symbols of the movie mean.Another thing you should notice while watching is that the film is essentially divided into four parts: the beginning of man; man at the year 2001; man as he ventures out into space to find the meaning of the monolith; and man as he enters some form of parallel universe, be it the afterlife or the realm of aliens. It is interesting to note that three of these sections are titled: the first, third, and fourth sections. Kubrick is clearly saying something here about how we have evolved. You'll notice as the first sequence cuts to the second that one ""tool"" of man becomes another, more complicated tool. Yet, there is no new title to this sequence, for perhaps we have not really evolved as people from our ancient roots. Technology is not given a favorable view in 2001, which is Kubrick's way of saying that technology does not make us ""better"" people. For all we have accomplished, we still kill each other by the boatload. Notice carefully what the first tool is used for.Also, pay attention to how much of a subject birth is in the film. I didn't notice the first time I watched, but there are five times when birth is directly or indirectly referenced.It should be mentioned that the film is not fast-paced, nor is there much dialogue. In fact, it is perhaps thirty minutes before any words are spoken. Be prepared for a long, artistic, beautiful journey into the nature of man, and our beliefs of a higher being."	5.0	A cinematic classic	2003-02-17	7	5	2
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	ABQEKKRD6WZFA	cpt matt	There are almost always two polar reactions to this movie - you either love it, or hate it. Almost all who love it read the book first, which helps them to understand what is going on. Imagine sitting in a theater in 1968 and watching a bunch of apes running around for 30 minutes. You'd think Stanley Kubrick was a self indulgent artist thumbing his nose at you.It's hard to convey some things in one medium, film or book. In this case, the two complement each other. The book helps you to understand the visual and conceptual ideas of the movie and the movie provide you with incredible special effects and flesh out the book. Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C Clarke wrote the book and did the movie concurrently for that very reason.The themes of 2001 are man's quest to explore, better understand where we came from and what lies ahead, what is the meaning of life. You may not like the answers these artists provide, but it is very thought provoking and still makes you think. Good art does that and 2001 Space Odessey is good art, both in film and in print. Both are highly regarded classics, both rightly so.	5.0	2001 Space Odessey - read the book first!	2009-12-24	2	2	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A39CX0EE4BZCZC	Craig Connell	"f your're looking at this review, you mainly want an opinion of what the Blu-Ray version looks like, because by now you've seen the film....perhaps many times. It's a unique movie which seems to have attained ""classic"" status.So how does this Blu-Ray look? Well, I'm going to write something you might not have read elsewhere: the transfer is good, but overrated.  I read review after review on other high-def websites and they just rave about the sharpness, so I bought the DVD.  Well, I found about half the movie looking really sharp - mainly the outside shots of the space vehicles - and the other half so-so to somewhat fuzzy.  In other words, it's okay but nothing spectacular despite what you've heard.If you doubt what I'm saying, rent a copy and watch the first 20 minutes. It isn't until the space ship scenes start where you get the sharp pictures. From that point it varies from good to great.Whether it's Blu-Ray or a regular DVD, the visuals in this movie have always been fascinating and the soundtrack is astounding, too, especially on a decent surround system. You've never heard Strauss' ""Blue Danube"" sound any better! Played during many of the slower parts of the film, the dramatic music enhances the feel of the immensity of space itself. Then, audibly, we hear these eerie chants whenever the mysterious monolith appears, whether its on earth, out in space, or in Jupiter. In other words, this film offers a fantastic assortment of visual and audio ""trips"" for the senses.....high-def or not.Story-wise, it's all about HAL, the computer, and two astronauts who are under his leadership. The spacemen - played by Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood - are good, but HAL steals the show. His ""voice"" is mesmerizing, a haunting monotone. In fact, Douglas Rain is the unsung ""hero"" of this movie, with his voice-work of ""Hal."" .The more one sees this movie, the more cold and evil HAL becomes.All in all, this is a movie I would think it would have be part of any movie fan's collection of the memorable films of the 20th century......so why not have it in its best form?"	4.0	Blu-Ray Very Good, But Not Outstanding	2009-01-17	7	6	1

I was hesitant to buy it because of some reviews saying it was a horrible transfer and compression, but in reading more, I found that they were talking about some older DVD version and not the Blu-Ray version.  2001 is crystal clear on Blu-Ray.  Everything looks amazing.  And it's a true testament to the genius of Stanley Kubrick when you can look at his film 40 years after it was made and see that the special effects still look as good or better than anything that's done today in CG.Don't hesitate to buy this on Blu-Ray.  You won't be sorry.  I threw it in just to check it out and ended up watching the whole thing because I couldn't take my eyes off it.

I enjoyed the methodically detailed sequences to which each piece of technology was shown. Obviously great thought were put into every scene however, I felt this movie lacked a sense of drama and thrilling suspense. Even though this movie is more then two in a half hours long, its apparent that  a lot of that time went to the slow paced space sequences instead of a broad plot.Regardless of what I said, I recognize this movie to be revolutionary  for its visual effects which Kubric subtley used to articulate the story and it will be classic for that.	4.0	Great visual effects but, needs more excitment in the story	2003-02-03	5	0	5

Magee ""amagee17"""	To those reviewers who did not have the patience to appreciate this film, or who were so bored they fast forwarded through many scenes, I can only say that there is a lot in life that you will miss out on.  This is the quintessential sci-fi film because it deals purely and explicitly with science fiction.  The film is valid because, from its 1968 perspective, it portrays a plausible vision of where Kennedy's fledgeling space innitiative could take us.  The film is daring and bold because Kubrick, again in 1968, had the audacity and vision to portray space exploration as something that had become altogether routine, mundane and boring.  The film is disturbing because, in this future, the computer is more warm and likeable than the cold, distant and emotionless humans.  The film is true to science.  It is one of the few in the genre that accurately portray the environment of space; weightlessness, silent, cold, dark and empty.  Metaphor and symbolism are the poetry of this film.  The &quot;Dawn of Man&quot; sequence offers the monolith as the catalyst for technological advancement.  The bone becomes a tool, but tools can be used for good or bad - duality.  The Stargazer uses the bone to kill Tapirs for sustainance, but he also uses the bone to kill his rival/threat.  HAL is the bone.  HAL is used to sustain the crew of the Discovery, but HAL is also used to kill the same crew because they appear to threaten the mission.  As for those who did not understand the ending, The film ends just like it begins - with speculation.  As of now, we can only speculate as to the earliest origins of the human race; and in 2001 we can only speculate as to what we can become.  For those of you who don't know, not all film is meant for entertainment.  This one is meant for reflection.  This is the kind of film we need to ballance the Armageddons and Independance Day's.  Not all films conform to the popular format that draws blockbuster crowds.  Not all films give up their answers in tidy little packages.  Some films have no answers at all, but rely on the intellect of the viewer to interpolate their own subjectivity.  Film is an extremely versatile medium, and this one proves the point brilliantly.	5.0	Open the pod bay doors, HAL	2003-11-24	26	23	3

It really boggles my mind how so many people on here give this movie a 5 star rating and call it a ""classic"" or ""the best movie of all time"".If you want a true classic, which includes a compelling plot, characters you feel for, beautiful direction, etc., then watch movies like ""The Godfather"", almost anything from Alfred Hitchcock, ""Shawshank Redemption"", ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Ben Hur"", ""Awakenings"", ""Sound of Music"", or ""Forrest Gump"".  To classify ""2001"" as a classic in as insult to the true classics.  But that's just my opinion, everybody is entitled to their own.  Hey, somebody might consider ""Police Academy 7"" a classic!To put it frankly, ""2001"" is quite simply the most boring movie I have ever seen.  I literally had to fight to stay awake...my eyelids became so heavy.  But I did manage to stay awake through it all, and I just didn't get the whole point of the movie.  If somebody asked me how the movie ended, I could not explain it to them, and I saw it with my own two eyes!  To me, this combination of boredom and confusion does not make an enjoyable experience.Maybe the movie is a little too deep for me.  I enjoy deep movies that make you think afterwards, but this is taking it too far.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A27CFNHYZG6WS8	darragh o'donoghue	'2001' has been called Kubrick's most optimistic film, the most explicit presentation of religious or spiritual impulse more tacitly glimpsed in films like 'Paths of Glory' or 'Barry Lyndon'.  With its monolith as godhead; tuning fork of the universe; the infinite made material; the solar system made crucifix; the revelation to man at his dawn; the warning to man at his most hubristic; the comfort to man in his despair and fear; connector of sun and moon; arbiter of Kubrick's beloved circle, an anti-Enlightenment circle of life that negates the linear progress of history, that suggests that nman is fundamentally un-improvable; but, more benevolently, perhaps a circle that returns man to his Creator, the Universe, the Infinite, makes him a child again, as he begins new life after death.It's up to you whether you buy the idea that '2001' is some kind of secular-sacred allegory: maybe it's just a coincidence that Kubrick uses Ligeti's 'Lux Aeterna' so crucially throughout.  I like to see Hal the super-computer, ironicially, as a projection of the human soul, a receptacle of all those emotions airbrushed out in this perfect futuristic utopia, where everything is clean, and everyone speaks with polite, robotic articulacy.  He is, to adapt Robert Warshow, the No to this world's Yes - I am not the first to suggest he has more character than any human in the film.  Is Hal a genuine tragic hero, that common Kubrick figure, the man in control, in power, who spectacularly loses it?Anyone who prefers misanthropic Kubrick (as I did when younger) will find plenty of material too, especially in the spectacularly cynical prologue, where the Dawn of Man - a phrase conjuring Enlightenment visions of reason, craft, hunting, farming - is a sermon on man's grotesque nature, his base instincts of greed, fear, violence, schism etc.  The godhead monolith doesn't awaken a sense of humility or goodness, but a brutal, nihilistic hubris, a desire to conquer the unknown.  Kubrick's famous cut, from a bone to spaceship,  suggests the unlovely instincts we have watched are not so much ironed out in the bright new 21st century, as channelled, or refined.Of course, '2001' has the tendency to bring out the pseud in anyone who falls under its spell.  An important part of its mesmerising power, however, like all Kubrick, is its comedy, which is often deflating.  The bone of a dead animal becoming a fantastically elaborate spaceship might be a profound philosophical statement, but a spaceship that becomes the floating pen of a snoozing passenger, or the idea of gravity-defying lavatories, are surely bathetic.  It is no accident that Strauss' 'Also Sprachen Zarathustra', a piece that suggests the majestic, the otherworldly, the beyond, is replaced by 'The blue Danube', which somehow lacks the stature for space, suggesting more the idea of holiday, carnival, reflected in the spaceship that looks like a carnival ferris wheel.This is to suggest that Kubrick is always keeping things in balanced tension - cynicism/optimism; philosophy/comedy.  The Melville-like emphasis on process, on man ritually doing things slowly, in real-time; the idea that movements are patterned, obeying unthinking processes, suggests an ancient, more primal world or spirit beneath the futurism.Surely it's enough that '2001' is one of the cinema's most beautiful films, each dazzlingly, delicately choreographed camera movement slamming open a doorway in your mind, culminating in the gorgeous, ice-grey apartment of my dreams.	5.0	A religious experience.	2001-09-28	23	15	8
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AIMGHPI1AGVRF	Davewise	"I really wanted to enjoy this movie. I love science fiction and enjoyed Kubrick's ""The Shining"". Unfortunately, the movie seemed much too long for what it contained. The scenes of the astronauts on the spaceship with HAL were very interesting and largely ahead of its time. What would happen if a computer with artificial intelligence was left in control? What if a computer developed its own ideas and was in fact sentient? It would certainly be amazing and rather helpful; however, it also has the possibility to be rather dangerous. The astronauts' mission itself was intriguing also, even if its conclusion was puzzling. People have discovered a mysterious monolith which is millions of years old. Its purpose and origin are unknown.This entire story could probably be done comfortably within a 1.5 hour movie; unfortunately, this movie is 2.5 hours. The scenes with the apes were too extended. While I enjoyed the music and like good cinematography set to classical pieces, I thought it was overused. A few sequences like that sprinkled throughout the movie would've been sufficient. As it was, there were many like this leading up to the scenes with HAL. And whatever meaning there might be behind the scene with the myriad colors, it did not need to be that long."	2.0	Decent 1.5 hour movie trapped inside a 2.5 hour movie	2009-10-12	23	6	17

Some viewers, especially younger viewers might find the slow pacing discouraging.  You have to hand it to Kubrick, he made a film like no other, and no one will ever make a film like this.  He really took a big chance here.The visuals are astonishing and mindblowing.  Every time I watch it I find it hard to take my eyes off it.  I would suggest watching it when you have a few hours of free time, I would recomend renting or purchasing the dvd, the picture and sound quality are very good, I would watch it in a dark room with the volume up rather loud to get the full effect.  I would really like to see it on the big screen.If you haven't seen it in awhile I would recomend you take another look.	5.0	Not a Movie, an Experience	2003-03-11	3	1	2
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"There are two camps on this film that either view it as a masterpiece or a colossal bore.  I may be a chump for director Stanley Kubrick but I'm going to characterize it as a masterpiece, though it is tough going.  I was fortunate to have seen this film many times theatrically including the wide-screen format.  This film deserves to be seen that way because the visuals and sound are so important to it.  What is always debated about this film is the meaning of all the symbolism(a.k.a the monolith).  The story, or the remnants of one, takes us from the dawn of man when primates first encounter the monolith to 2001 when the monolith is unearthed again to a mission to Jupiter and beyond.  Aboard the Jupiter spacemission, we encounter a computer, HAL, who developes a mind of his own.  This may be Kubrick's way of saying that our technology may be outpacing us.  Though the nominal star of the film is Keir Dullea as astronaut Dave Bowman, but Dullea acts more like a passenger in this odyssey than an actual participant.  Was it intentional on the part of Kubrick that the most full-bodied performances are delivered by somebody in an ape suit(Dan Richter) and the disembodied voice of a computer(Douglas Rain)?  I'm not going to try to interpret the meaning of this film.  Kubrick was always deliberately vague about leaving it up to the viewer to interpret it any way they see fit.  If you need a more literal translation of the film you can read the novelization of the film by Arthur C. Clarke, but I don't think Kubrick would have accepted some of the explanations posed in it.  Interestingly, Kubrick destroyed the sets and blueprints to this film because he did not want a sequel made of it.  Years later Clarke wrote ""2010"", and they had to copy the sets from scratch in order to make the film version of that novel.  The film of ""2010"" was OK but it attempted to explain the vaguaries of ""2001"" and the explanations were somewhat disappointing.  Some people prefer the literalness of ""2010"" but you rarely hear mention of that film these days."	5.0	Ambitious Sci-fi  Masterpiece From Kubrick	2004-09-30	9	8	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AO4CUU1PY5D5W	David B. Fisher	I know this is a classic and I watched it when it premiered in 1968, a few years after that and then again recently. I am still trying to figure out why many consider it to be a masterpiece. I know it is supposed to be quintessential classic Kubrick, but I still puzzle at the subtle (and not so subtle) nuances.  If I have to consult various sources and study analyses of a movie just to understand the basic premise, it is too much work for me.  I do not have an appreciation for minimalism when it comes to cinematic experiences.  I find the slow pace coupled with inexplicable events and disjointed and unrelated scenes to be more work than pleasure, and even after many explanations on the meaning behind the movie, I find it tiring to watch.  I appreciate it as an ingenious work of art; however, like most performance art pieces, it is best experienced once and then forgotten.	1.0	2001: A Space Puzzlement	2014-05-13	5	3	2
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	Stanley Kubrick and his co-screenwriter, the great science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, have fashioned a big, epic story about the evolution of human consciousness and man's place in the universe.  It begins in pre-history and ends in what was then the near-future, revealing that throughout all of our history, the human race has been monitored by a mysterious alien race via an artifact known as the Monolith.  The pace of the film is deliberate and slow, too slow for my taste, and that's basically my reason for shaving a star from what is otherwise a masterpiece.  I'm not looking for slam-bang, quick cut editing, but there are a number of long sequences that could have been shortened by about 25%, especially in view of the fact that the entire running time is greater than two hours.  Even so, this is a fascinating, thought-provoking film, and the only one I can recall that portrays space as a soundless environment.  This bit of reality adds an eerie dimension to the film and somehow intensifies the loneliness of the situation.  The light show near the end seems dated now and also could have stood some cutting, but, nevertheless, this is an important and serious piece of cinema.	4.0	Watching 2001 in 2005	2005-07-04	3	1	2

But this review will focus on the presentation on Blu-ray disc.I never knew this film was so beautiful.  They way it is shot, the color, the landscapes.  On Blu-ray disc, this film simply sparkles.  I have about 15 Blu-rays, and some have been worthy upgrades over the DVD.  Most have not, IMO.  2001 is, if you really like the film, a reason to upgrade to the new format.Not only is the film beautifully mastered, trumping the 2001 (year) release of the DVD, it has worthy bonus material.  The DVD had no real bonuses.  But here, you get a generous helping of material, all worthy of your time.The menus are elegant and functional.I am not a complete convert to Blu-ray, still being mostly a DVD collector.  I don't know what the concurrent DVD relase looks like, and to be fair, the 2001 (year) release wasn't the highest-quality DVD.  But in this case, the Blu-ray is definitely a reason to upgrade.  I don't see how this film could look better.	5.0	Worthy Upgrade	2007-12-19	4	2	2

The film is long but it never ambles or stalls. It marches at its own ""just right"" pace from beginning to end inviting you to savor each word, each scene, each dizzyingly perfect camera angle. I've heard many versions of what the film is about. But after almost 40 years of sometimes sober, sometimes drunken and occasionally post-coital discussions about it, I still don't know what it's about and frankly I just don't care anymore. I can recite the story line, sure. But what are the major themes? How does one articulate them? I think only the writer, Arthur C. Clark, knows for sure how to frame those notions into a coherent whole.  But for the mentally fragmented rest of us, the movie shines like a multi-faceted crystal twirling in the light, inviting us to think, to ponder, to have our own epiphany or two about consciousness, human evolution, and the collective destiny of humankind. Or was that the destiny of a single human in the context of the many? I forget. Not sure it matters. Nonetheless, the film causes you to ponder yet again the nature of the universe and more than anything come to the conclusion that the universe could be even stranger and more beautiful than you thought. Or is that - more beautiful than you remember? I don't know. It turns out that the distinction is not all that important either. The film will forever remain a beautiful, unparalleled and utterly glorious enigma to me. If it hasn't already, I hope it does for you as well."	5.0	2001 as an archetypal movie experience	2007-04-20	5	5	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3T10K5B1JNSCV	David	"I'm neither spiritually transcended, nor upset about the movie. The plot was definitely slow and any apparent explanation of some of the movie's elements does not exist. I think the visuals were great in and of themselves, and my personal interpretation of the movie's plot is intriguing... But who knows what Stanley Kubrick/Arthur C. Clark was trying to convey? Maybe I should've read the book.I don't like saying any movie is ""classic""; that sorta places it upon to a pedestal for classic-movie-haters and the like to practice potshots at. I can sorta relate to them, I suppose calling it classic is equivalent to saying art is supposed to be interpreted in only one way.For me, the strongest point of the film is my own personal interpretation [spoiler ahead] in which man achieves a 'higher understanding' (and that *doesn't* have to be infinite, contrary to what so many reviewers have said), however pseudo-intellectual that seems. In and of that alone is a good reason to buy the movie (for me anyway), which for me is way of ahead of its time (even for most of today's sci-fi, particularly sci-fi movies). If you can watch it through the end with a little diligent patience and open, probing mind, you'll *probably* find the movie enjoyable.I have bought the DVD and the picture quality is very good, even on a regular small non-widescreen TV. A melding of the motion and music is still asthetically pleasing, even if your thoughts wonder. Maybe 2001: A Space Odyssey should come with complementary Ritalin pills :-P.Probably even a more entertaining nugget was to find one review conveying how only ivory-tower pseudo-intellectuals could like this film, and then right after it, someone claims to have had a ""spiritual+mystical"" experience from it!

Just goes to show that you need to keep the children amused somehow, but they should stay away from the books with the big words.  This is an adult movie about the origins, path, and possible future outcome of the human race.  We start with primative tools, and progress to the point that we can build an enormous spacship in the span of 18 months to go adventuring..  What more is there for us to accomplish with our mechanical skills anyway?  We can also build a computer so advanced that it can go insane, just like we do.  We're at a dead end, and the people who put the block there knew it.  They put out beacon for us to follow when we were ready, with the opportunity to pass on to the next level of existence.  But don't get me wrong; modern day adolescents need more bright lights and loud noises to keep themselves amused and away from the breakable china.As an aside, the original story by Clarke wasn't so optimistic.  The beacon was placed on the moon as a warning signal for the race who put it there.  When we got good enough to find and destroy it, it's signal naturally stopped, letting the folks on the other side know that we had advanced enough to be a potential problem.  The battle fleet would be coming to put us in our place before long."	5.0	For Adults Only	2005-03-11	4	4	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2KI91IR3RA7D0	David L. Vasser	There are many Amazon reviewers who complain about a bad transfer and disappointing audio, however these people must be talking about the standard DVD version.  The Blu-Ray version is jaw dropping spectacular.  After it ended I had to sit still for a few minutes just like the first time I saw it and recompose myself.This film has many fans and I'm one of them.  I consider it one of the finest movies ever made period and beyond that one of the best visual arts of the 20th century.  I will watch it over and over as each time I find new things within it.  I'm really glad I ordered this Blu-Ray version.  If you loved the film in the theater but you don't have a Blu-Ray player and a 1080 HDTV then here is the reason why you should buy them both immediately.  An unequaled and unforgettable Blu-Ray experience.There are many interesting special features included on the Blu-Ray including a behind the scenes half-hour documentary LOOK Magazine showed to potential advertisers for a special edition of LOOK focusing on science and technology tied in with the upcoming release of the film.  I found that feature an excellent bonus as I had not seen it before. (LOOK Magazine had a unique relationship with Kubrick as they gave him his first job as an apprentice photographer right out of high-school and when he made his first film, a documentary, Kubrick was still a LOOK staff photographer.)  I usually don't watch the commentary versions, but in this case I absolutely will.  I am so glad I bought this, it is now my favorite Blu-Ray disc and when I want to show off my Blu-Ray this is the disc I'll use from now on.Some people don't like this film much, the excellent Blu-Ray display quality won't change their point of view about the film in general.  But to people who have always found this film to be eloquent and profound art then it is definitely worth the buy. This Blu-Ray version is one of my best Amazon buys ever!	5.0	Spectacular Blu-Ray Experience!	2012-10-09	9	9	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AK5GX7SPA9QEW	David Rosenberg	"So I don't think it's important for me to rate the movie or director of this disc......my own opinion is that Kubrick was a visionary and ""cinematic"" director if ever there was one.  2001 remains a quintessential Kubrick movie.  I also find that the special effects, while dated stylistically and somewhat simplistic, hold up remarkably well considering.  But it seems that people either like Kubrick or just think he's too boring, cerebral, or aloof.For 2001 fans, this disc is certainly worth owning.....not sure why the selected reviews are for the older DVD versions, but the region 1 HD DVD has 6 featurettes and a commentary with the major actors of the film.  It's miles more feature rich then the DVD.  I also bought the newly remastered Shining and Sparticus HD DVDs......the Shining is another movie that's worth the upgrade to HD (film quality is improved as well as having extra features for Kubrick fans).I think one of the most important reasons for plunking more money down for a HD disc is the picture quality.  Lucky for us, Warner has decided to remaster many of the Kubrick movies.  The only one that has let me down a bit is Sparticus (it's obvious they didn't do much for the HD version).  Comparing this 2001 with my older DVD copy, the picture is both crisper and more faithful on HD over the DVD counterpart.  If it weren't for the dated costumes, you would think that it might have been filmed just this year!

The video quality is outstanding with details I had never experienced when watching this movie before. The audio is what you would expect from a 40 year old film with long silent streches; not much 5.1 action going on.The movie itself is ground breaking and difficult to grasp. It hints at many themes but does not develop them fully therefore many people are perplexed by it. I have my own theories but I'm not saying anything because part of the appeal of this movie is that you can make your own theory about what it all means. If you are an action junkie this movie is not for you. If you can develop your own ideas without much direction this movie will stimulate you.

Even though its visionary path was not followed and things turned out differently than was predicted, the story remains one of the most thought provoking and original stories that has ever been transferred to film.

What is also apparent is that this version was in fact not re-mastered for blu-ray.  If it was, I seriously question the knowledge and skills of the engineers who did the work.

It never looked  and sounded so beautiful until this DVD version which has a new Dolby  Digital 5.1 soundtrack.  The sound gets high marks and be careful to  putting this so loud and having people close by because there are some ear  piercing sounds in this movie.  As mentioned earlier, the video is  beautiful and the colors are still very &quot;beautiful&quot;.But  sometimes the best movies can be the worst movies for some people.  As  mentioned, this movie is not the typical sci-fi movie that everyone will  love.  It's one of those slower paced movies that moves in slow increments  and also it's a thinking movie.  I happen to love these type of movies, I  know many people who don't.So, the movie can be rated differently by  viewers but if you liked it the first time, you like it again and again.  As for the special features, I wish there was more added but you get the  two trailers for &quot;2001&quot; and &quot;2010&quot; and the old  interview with Arthur C. Clarke.  There is an 8-page booklet but I wish  they added this on the DVD.  I wonder if there could of been more added,  deleted scenes and more but then again, this movie was made back in 1968.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend this DVD for true sci-fi fans who have a  great imagination, who are great thinkers and can watch a somewhat cerebral  movie and have a fun time.  The beautiful visuals and audio will hook you.Again, this movie is not for everyone but it's one of the best true film  masterpieces of all time.	5.0	2001: a space odyssey DVD review: Great movie!	2000-06-25	1	1	0

The special effects, which were cutting-edge at the time, now seem almost crude.  That destroys the trademark wedding of stunning visual effects to stunning music, which is timeless, as is the nature music, so that what was originally a young beauty walking arm-in-arm with a dashing young beau is now a young beauty walking arm-in-arm with a decrepit old man.  That in turn only highlights the banality of the dialogue and the woodenness of the acting which didn't entirely escape me even at the time,  In its day 2001 was a masterpiece, but Dr. Strangelove has aged much better.	3.0	Better in memory than in 2014	2014-04-23	3	0	3
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	ABN5K7K1TM1QA	Dennis Littrell	"Regardless of how ""bored"" some (probably adolescent) viewers may become (forced to maintain their attention span over vast minutes of time on something other than sex, car chases and dripping blood), this is obviously a great movie.  At least for the rest of us.  Rated in the top 250 (#66) at IMDb, and the subject of innumerable articles and reviews, Stanley Kubrick's much studied and admired visual, artistic and thematic masterpiece, based on the short story ""The Sentinel"" by Arthur C. Clarke, is still--remarkably, after all these years--a mesmerizing motion picture experience even on a television screen.This is no mean accomplishment when you realize that Kubrick made his film before humans actually walked on the moon in 1969, and furthermore, when you consider how much more we now know about space travel and how much more advanced special effects have become.  What I think contemporary movie makers might learn from Kubrick's work is (1) special effects without rhyme or reason may titillate first time viewers and the very young, but quickly grow meaningless; and (2) even in a movie that relies heavily upon special effects and ideas--which 2001: A Space Odyssey certainly does--it helps a whole lot to have a story to tell.The story begins in the prehistory and ends in the future.  It begins with a pre-human consciousness and ends in mystery.  (Note that the last sequence in the movie is labeled in part as being ""beyond the infinite""--whatever that metaphysical notion may mean.)  Along the way we have a creditable hero (Astronaut Dave Bowman played by Keir Dullea, whom I also recall from David and Lisa, 1962) and a very cold and merciless villain (HAL 9000, the computer as megalomaniac--apparently his makers never heard of Issac Asimov's rules for robots!).Today we know more about pre-humans and more about computers, artificial intelligence and space exploration, and with such knowledge today's movie makers would avoid some of Kubrick's mistakes.  For example, the space craft was far too roomy (ask the astronauts!).  Real space ships must be as small as possible to save fuel and they are incredibly cramped.  Also, the year 2001 has come and passed, and we are nowhere near the practical capability of providing ""artificial"" gravity in space.  And of course computers (or robots) don't have emotions unless such emotions are built or programmed into them.Yet the visual sense of space and the terrible isolation of being alone in the vast vacuum has never been conveyed so well.  Using music synchronized with visual effects laden with meaning for our earth-bound minds and bodies, Kubrick managed to depict the Pythagorean ""music of the spheres"" in a most splendiferous and awe-inspiring way.However, the opening sequence with the hairy apes is probably what Kubrick would most like to redo if he had the opportunity.  In the first place, the terrain, which is semi-arid, is all wrong.  No hairy, long-armed, bent-legged creature would occupy such a landscape.  The ""foraging"" they were supposed to be doing was ludicrous since there was obviously next to nothing to forage.  The tapirs (forest-dwelling animals native to South America and Southeast Asia, by the way, and not to the savannas of Africa, which should have been the terrain depicted) were almost comedically fat for the ecosystem.  And the apes themselves, looking and acting a lot like chimpanzees (no doubt the model that Kubrick used), are in conflict with the fossil record as we know it.  Our primordial ancestors, the australopithecines, were upright walking apes and probably not exceedingly hairy since they needed to sweat as they walked and ran over the savannas and grasslands of East Africa.As for using bones as weapons, yes, there can be little doubt that that is what our ancestors learned to do, followed by using hard wood and stones and then shaped stones.  And the idea that a bone tool is a proto-type for all the tools to come is also correct, most saliently in the form of the space ship and HAL.An interpretation of the ending would necessarily include the idea of time as being something other than we think it is.  We see Dave as an astronaut in his thirties, and then as a middle-aged man dining in something like a very expensive Parisian apartment, and then on his death bed, and finally as a soon-to-be-born fetus returning to earth.  I think it was wise of Kubrick not to attempt to explain what he clearly points to as unexplainable, as ""beyond the infinite.""Perhaps the most haunting image of all, at least for me, is the red and yellow ""eye"" of the HAL 9000 computer as it coldly viewed the two astronauts talking.  Therein was expressed, long before it became fashionable, the coming inexorable conflict between us and our machines, between our culture and our biological nature, between natural and artificial intelligence.  Never in the history of cinema has that tension been so concisely conveyed as in that scene and in this movie.See this for Stanley Kubrick, one of the greatest film makers of all time."	5.0	Still a masterpiece	2003-12-14	220	160	60
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A23C0H59N2VNX9	dennis middlebrooks	I can understand why so many people dislike this film. There is no vulgarity, no sex, no blood and gore and no brain-dead story line. There are also no exploding spaceships or smart-aleck celebrity cast members preening for the screen. People who relish trash like &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;, &quot;Men in Black&quot; and &quot;Independence Day&quot; had best avoid this film. It will be wasted on you.However, for those who appreciate visionary cinema, glorious visual effects, great music and an opportunity to employ your thinking processes, this is the film for you! You will be in the hands of a great director who actually respected the intelligence of his audience and demanded something from them. I have seen 2001 many times and each time I come away with new insights and different perspectives. This is a film that can be interpeted on many different levels. Like the music of Beethoven, you can throw a rock into 2001 A Space Oddyssey and never hear it strike bottom. It is, in my opinion, the greatest film ever made and there has been nothng remotely like it before or since.As for those who find it boring and incomprehensible, fear not! I am sure Adam Sandler, Will Smith, Jim Carrie et al will be coming out with more insulting junk for you to gush over. That stuff is more on your level.	5.0	a film for the ages	2002-01-05	3	2	1

Fades to black end up with dozens  of veritcal dark gray bars; scenes with bright colors on a dark background  (i.e. the sun from space) have extreme color quantization - meaning you can  see distinct rings of color around the bright object, not a smooth  transition.For a polar opposite, watch The 5th Element.  None of these  artifacts are visible, even though it is a much brighter and more difficult  to encode movie (e.g. more motion).Not to mention the countless film  artifacts.  True this is a 30 year old movie, but there is software to  clean up that kind of cruft.Stick with the VHS version, you will  appreciate it more.  Truly a shameful job.

My friends and I took the plunge and booked the best seats available right at the centre of curvature of the screen. It was an  experience I shall remember for the rest of my life: totally absorbing, awe  inspiring, terrifying. Nothing can compare with that viewing and the small  screen can never compare with high quality Cinerama production.Here.s  hoping that next year, 2001 will bring some theatre productions in IMAX or  Cinerama. I'll be first in the line to book.Incidentally, some reviewers  gloat over what they term a wonderful AMERICAN film. 2001 was conceived by  an englishman Arthur C Clarke, and made entirely in the UK with British set  makers, film crews and effects specialists.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AZ9FDV76PVB5G	Derek Lee	When 2001 is criticized, it is judged for what it isn't.  Make no mistake, this movie does not move quickly, it doesn't have a plot to speak of, no remarkable dialogue, only one memorable character (a demented computer no less!), and a focus on the surreal that leaves alot of people scratching their heads.  But criticizing the movie for those issues misses the point totally.  This movie doesn't express itself in the same way that virtually every movie since world war one has.  The whole point of the movie is to give the viewer some sense of what it might mean to make contact with extraterrestrial intelligence.  Of course, when that happens, the experience will be of awe-inspiring grandeur, and far, far more questions than answers.  This movie is precisely made to instill that feeling, not to further some plot or explore the foibles of some particular character.  The overwhelming sense that I get from watching this movie is of the universe being infinitely grander than anything experienced or even contemplated on Earth, and that the universe doesn't especially care about our social structures, moral codes, or even our existence.  This might be seen as bleak, and many people see the movie as very depressing, but it seems to me that if we can let go of our obsessions in this world, irrelevant as they are in the grand scheme, and immerse ourselves in the universe, we become far greater than we ever were before (the star-child).I could say alot about how technically wonderful this movie is, but that's already been done to death.  I'll just say that this movie isn't for all tastes, but I hope that my comments give you an idea of whether you'll enjoy it.	5.0	Possibly the greatest movie, definitely the most creative	2008-02-15	3	3	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2IHIKHWCDB0FG	Dexter Manning	"FILM REVIEWWhatever one may feel about the meaning behind Stanley Kubrick's science fiction masterwork, ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" it is virtually impossible to deny that it is a film that was years ahead of its time (and not just the year in which most of it is set). So different is it from other films of its day, including those that could be considered science fiction or fantasy, that it comes as almost no surprise that executives at its studio, Metro Goldwyn Mayer, sat in the screening room aghast upon seeing the fruits of their company's multi-million-dollar financing, and that the film did not gain a substantial following until later. Such is frequently the case with phenomena that is groundbreaking--or that which is merely different. Now, of course, it's one of Kubrick's--and filmdom's--most famous and inspiring works.In many ways, this is a different kind of film, also, for its own director, Kubrick. By 1968, when this film was released, he had already displayed, through his preceding body work, one of the foremost gifts that should define any film director worth his salt: the ability to direct a series of films of a vastly diverse nature, bestowing each with its own distinct style and feel. Looking at Kubrick's overall work, in terms of theme and style (from ""Spartacus,"" to ""Lolita"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"") one may assume, at first, that no two of them are from the same director. That same one, it turns out, would be quite wrong. Yet, with ""2001"" we also see an intense development of the basic traits that tended to manifest themselves in a variety of ways in all the Kubrick films that succeeded ""2001,"" particularly that of a bold, super-stylized cinematic experience peculiar to Kubrick, unlike anything elsewhere. This style of the surreal had its genesis with ""Dr Strangelove,"" the last Kubrick movie before ""2001,"" though it is used to completely different effect there. ""2001"" is nothing if not a film about exploration, so it is more than appropriate that Kubrick defies any conventional limits to the exploration of cinematic and, yes, narrative styles. We should be glad he does.And, it seems we indeed are glad. It is, in the end, rather difficult to point to any significant cinematic story made since ""2001"" about adventures in outer space without observing some aspect of this film's influence, even only as a faint echo.I find the claims that the film's narrative and the meaning behind it are opaque to be rather overstated, especially after repeat viewings. The film does allow for an unusually wide array of interpretation, but this, I feel, is good. Why shouldn't a film allow for such discussions? In any case, the plot of the screenplay (written by Kubrick and the great scientist and writer Arthur C. Clarke) is most basically summarized as follows: in the year 2001, astronauts on a discreet mission search for and encounter a mysterious entity, an alien force, thousands of years old, with the power to mold the lives and the very evolution of the human race. It also embodies the powers to effectively repel others and open the minds of our ancestors and decendants alike to profound discoveries previously unthought of by humans.It may seem odd that a story which concerns itself mainly about space travel and strange encounters actually begins at the time of man's earliest ancestors, amidst a tribe of apes, but it turns out to be an appropriate prologue. This tribe's very survival in its arid, rugged desert landscape, is controlled according to the pleasure of a competing band of apes who, for instance, where food is concerned, chase the first tribe away and otherwise violently bully them into settling for scraps when they are not cowering in caves.However, the situation changes with dramatic effect not too long after the weaker tribe (and we) first encounter the mysterious, godlike alien force--represented by a giant black monolith that rises on its thin edge from the ground, towering high above every life form around it, elegant in its stark simplicity. By stroke of genius, by reconsidering its environment and, specifically, the objects within that environment, the weak tribe not only finds the means to obtain food for itself, but to effectively and conclusively fend off attacks by the rival tiibe. It has learned to use violence as the method to survive.Skip to the early twenty-first century and a chain of missions in an outer space with no bounds, these quests being the main attraction the remainder of the film is devoted to. The first centers chiefly on Dr Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) an astronaut who, with his team on a classified mission, is searching for the cause of strange occurences on a barren U.S. outpost in space. The second, and most-remembered, mission, a trip toward the planet Jupiter, is shared by five astronomers--Drs Dave Bowman and Frank Poole (Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood, respectively) plus three who are in a state of ""hybernation""--and their spaceship's onboard computer, known as the HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain), an omnipresent entity so personable as to be a like a human character in its own right. It is so much so, we eventually find, that, like the human species that created it, it is fallable, and can indeed fall prey to all-too-human traits. Such is this circumstance that leads to the third and final mission, one filled with profound lonliness, fear, and, at its very end, discovery. Ultimately, though, this is a movie less about specific characters than about an experience.Virtually everything about this film looks and feels vast and open, and appropriately so. One of the characteristics of this film I have always cherished is the calm, unhurried pace with which most of it flows. The silences of space and the lengthy periods between conversations--and there is remarkably little dialogue in the picture--are filled with classical music composed by Aram Khatchaturian, Gy&ouml;rgy Ligeti, Johann Strauss, and Richard Strauss, lending a certain lyrical quality to the entire experience. It's a soundtrack that goes a long way toward making the film feel, by turns, symphonic, playful, relaxed, bombastic, epic, and, ultimately, profound. I've always relished the speechless sections of the film, which say so much more without words than they could even if words filled their every second. It is in large part due to the slower general pace that give the few fast-moving spots that do exist more tension.Technically, the film is pitch-perfect in creating this unprecedented work of art. The deep-focus cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth uses 70mm film (""Super Panavision,"" as it was branded at the time) and renders everything with richly detailed texture. (You'll especially appreciate it if you see the film in a high-definition format like Blu-ray disc). Observing the special effects, imagined by Kubrick and materialized by a team consisting of Wally Veevers, Douglas Trumbull, Con Pederson, and Tom Howard, one easily forgets that the film was made in the late sixties; most of them look as if they were created a decade later. The spaceships, ranging in size from tiny ""pods"" to those that resemble aircraft found here on Earth, to Floyd's sprawling, spinning spacestation, are especially well-realized and convincing. Also impressive, especially considering the time the film was made, are the special effects related to the absence of gravity, from something as simple as a floating pen, to the shot of an attendant walking the perimeter of a tube-shaped room, in her ""grip shoes,"" carrying trays of food, until she is upside-down.The editing, critical in any movie, is handled especially well here by Ray Lovejoy. For example, the cut from the stone-age sequence to the first shot of outer space is not only the most famous in the film, but one of the best-known and most effective (and, it turns out, metaphoric) cuts in the history of film. The visual poetry of self-reflection in the final sequence is created with little more than simple cuts in the editing room.The film employs a number of long-duration shots, some shown from the vantage point of cameras staying focused on characters as they move fluidly through the set. One example is when we meet Dr Poole as he jogs along his spaceship's cylindrical path, which seems to rotate around him. (Unsworth's cameraman here is Kelvin Pike.) Such innovative camera work became another Kubrick signature, especially in his later films. It has the effect, to an extent, of rendering more realistic scenarios that are decidedly unreal. In any case, it must have been an added treat to have seen the film in Cinerama, as it was originally presented in theaters.If I am to single out the most memorable visual component it would be Kubrick's imagination of what a future in space would look like and his highly stylized composition of that world on-sceen. Several such details date the film--always a major risk when employing a production design influenced by styles, ideas, and companies that happen to be ultra-chic at the time of filming--only to become utter cast-offs sometime later. By the 2000s, PanAm had disappeared long before it could make any trans-galaxy flights. Black had become the new white, and titanium the new black. Telephone booths were largely a relic of the past, replaced by tiny things people carried around, cradled in their ear. The Bell System was dissolved before it was put back together again (I suppose some things change but don't really change). Howard Johnson's did not grow to be the preferred lodging post for astronauts. People had grown less formal and more casual. Computers had became smaller, not larger (to thoroughly computerize Bowman and Poole's ship would surely require an entire room, yes, but likely not as endless as the one shown here). And, of course, the primary focus was far less on space travel than it was on war here on Earth.But, interesting as it may be to compare the reality in the film with that of our own real lives, such comparisons are, on many levels, a pointless exercise. Films about the future, by their very nature, are subject to their visions never becoming reality. It is important when judging a film to take into consideration the era in which it was made and the state of the technology and fashion that the era produced (as well as the era's filmmaking conventions--from most of which ""2001"" deviates entirely). It is remarkable to note, however, that the film was made just before space exploration became reality. The filmmakers did not have as many real-life reference points as would have been available a few years later. This makes the world dreamed of by Kubrick all the more remarkable. Taken on its own terms, it's a movie that stands the test of time and will likely continue to inspire viewers and filmmakers alike.ON THE DISCThis review refers to the Blu-ray disc edition. The features of other available editions may differ.The Blu-ray disc of this film is a must for hi-def afficionados and for fans of the movie or Kubrick. ""2001"" looks stellar and many visual nuances you may have missed otherwise are revealed at this resolution. The compositions for most shots are sharp and in deep focus. The feature's original aspect ratio of its theatrical release of 2.2:1 is preserved (as is the case with most films on Blu-ray discs). Audio is provided in Dolby 5.1.--An audio commentary by the actors Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood is included. That of each appear to have been recorded separately, then mixed together, resulting in the usual reduction of synergy among those who speak. I've long found remarkable how often the simple act of having the two or more featured commentators speak in the room together adds much to the overall commentary experience. Those involved, in addition to speaking about what they themselves see and hear from the feature, also respond to the comments from one another. This often provides a new or unexpected take on the film. Understandably, it is not always possible for everyone to be together. My feeling is, if the commentators must be recorded separately, then they should each have their own dedicated commentary track on the disc.The two lead actors share much of their personal experiences (sometimes to an extent that is too digressive), from their backgrounds to their respect of Kubrick to their experiences making the film. They describe how a number of scenes--in particular the ones in which they appeared--were carried out with remarkable insight, given their roles in the film. There is much praise of Kubrick and the film and some generalities, but one wishes, especially for a film of this significance, that much of it would have been more enlightening, shedding more complete light on the making of the film and its special effects, its role in film history, how and why the music was selected, and so on. This is especially true of the portions of the film in which neither Dullea nor Lockwood appear. For instance, imagine what contributions Clarke and the special effects team could have made on separate commentary tracks.The other special features (in 480p standard definition with stereo or mono audio) include...--2001: The Making of a Myth. This 43-minute documentary actually provides much more of the insight into the production and philosophy behind the film that the commentary track lacks. Actor Keir Dullea, who is generally more insightful on the audio commentary than Gary Lockwood, is but one of several participants in this documentary. Another of the movie's actors, Daniel Richter, as well as co-writer Arthur C. Clarke, and special effects supervisors Douglass Trumbull and Con Pederson also appear, along with film historians and critics, and authorities on applicable technology and astronomy. Some of these people should have also appeared on an audio commentary track or two.--Standing on the Shoulders of Kubrick: the Legacy of 2001 is, essentially, a tribute to Kubrick and how, by creating ""2001,"" he not only revolutionized science fiction films and their special effects but implemented an unusual, but effective and memorable way to tell a story. During the duration of the twenty-one-minute featurette we see brief commentaries by a wide range of professionals: directors George Lucas (""Star Wars""), Sydney Pollack (""Out of Africa,"" ""Three Days of the Condor,""), Steven Spielberg (""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""), and William Friedkin (""The French Connection,"" ""The Exorcist""); screenwriter Dan O'Bannon (""Alien""); producer Jan Harlan (""The Shining,"" ""Eyes Wide Shut""); effects supervisors Douglass Trumbull (""2001"") and Dennis Muren (""Jurassic Park""); cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (""War of the Worlds""); sound designer Ben Burtt (""Star Wars,"" the ""Indiana Jones"" series); authors David Hughes (The Complete Kubrick) and Paul Duncan (Stanley Kubrick: The Complete Films); film critic Roger Ebert (Chicago Sun-Times); and others.The comments, especially taken together, reflect not only a profound appreciation of ""2001"" and Kubrick, but how far ahead of its time the film was at the time. One starts to feel the amount of praise in so short a time, however much it is merited--and it is merited--but will nonetheless appreciate the reflections on the films far-from-insignifcant contribuitions to science fiction, special effects, storytelling, and filmmaking itself.--Vision of a Future Passed: The Prophecy of 2001. The second featurette, also just over twenty minutes long, is an intriguing comparison of the future as envisioned in the film and how human progress and life had actually evolved by the year 2001. It seems the film was more than half-accurate, no mean feat considering the filmmakers did not have the benefit of of actual records of space. Many of the same commentators who appeared in ""Standing on the Shoulders of Kubrick,"" are also featured here, joined by authors Arthur C. Clarke (2001: A Space Odyssey) and John Baxter (Stanley Kubrick: A Biography), and others. The comparisons discuss space travel, technology, and icons from life, among other topics, while raising questions as to why humans are not further along in their explorations of space, and moral issues concerning technological development. An interesting and thoughtful discussion.--2001 A Space Odyssey: A Look Behind the Future. Originally produced in the mid-1960s while ""2001"" was, apparently, still fairly early in its production, this twenty-three minute piece depicts some of the making of the film, including the construction of the sets and related models, brief interviews with a handful of key people involved with the realization of the film, such as Clarke and Dullea, and insights into Kubrick and Clarke's philosophy on what space exploration in the year 2001 might be like. The dry style in vogue when this documentary was filmed, especially the voice-over, with its level-headed tone and slightly detached authority, reminds one of old educational films seen in grade school. It turns out this featurette was used as a publicity tie-in to attract advertisers to Look, the well-known photographic magazine. In relation to the rest of this disc, it is less a conduit for learning about any related topic (better covered by the other features) than a historical curiosity, almost like an archeologist discovering something that only further confirms what many people already know. It is, nonetheless, interesting to see how such a featurette--made during the throws of filming and as much documentary as promotional piece--was conducted.--What Is Out There? Keir Dullea resembles a college professor lounging comfortably in his home as he lectures on this contemplation on life and other issues as expressed by Kubrick and in the film. The featurette includes short portions of a 1966 BBC interview with Clarke. The execution, which involves, essentially, just a couple talking heads plus an occasional film clip, is decidedly dry enough to put viewers to sleep, but it captures a few of the many conversations the film can inspire.--2001: FX and Early Conceptual Artwork. As the title implies, this is a brief (nine-minute) exploration of some of the special effects and the earlier drawings used to conceptualize the special space sequences in the film, with the most focus given to the ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite"" section. Doug Trumbull, who helped create the so-called ""stargate"" sequence, explains how some of the effects were created. Christiane Kubrick gives a brief intro to the drawings, which, despite some similarities, look remarkably different than what was finally depicted. Despite its simplicity and short length, it's one of the more useful features on the disc.--Look: Stanley Kubrick! The shortest featurette is a selection of Kubrick's still photographs for Look magazine. It only makes sense that a man known for the remarkable visual compositions used in his motion pictures would also be a fine still photographer. Yet his photos are often overlooked. This short does a nice job in presenting them. The editing, ironically, sometimes provides a kind of animated quality to the piece. The lively jazz score used is fine. However, one wonders why a classical score wasn't chosen, as Kubrick so frequently and famously used them not only in ""2001"" but many of his films.--A 1966 Stanley Kubrick Interview by Jeremy Bernstein, covering his days as a (below-average) high-school student, his days at Look magazine, the making and exhibition of his first short, his life as a director, working with actors, and more. It's an audio-only interview that, at well over an hour long, is a nice introduction to Kubrick.--The theatrical trailer. I suspect Kubrick was a director who had an important role in the marketing of many of his films, including ""2001."" Although it does not always occur, including members of the creative team, especially the director, in the formation of the conception of the posters, trailers, and other elements that promote the film is usually a good thing, although creating a good trailer is an artform all itself, separate from the movie. The trailer for ""2001"" is simple, playing the movie's most famous musical piece, ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" over brief shots from the film cut together like a montage that becomes increasingly dramatic. It shows enough to entice, but not so much as to spoil the film. Well done.The disc's packaging, interface, and chapter selections share the same basic structure as other Blu-ray discs from Warner Home Video. The main feature film on this disc starts almost immediately after it is inserted into the player. Blu-ray discs tend to have more elaborate on-screen menus that make the ones for ""2001"" seem very simple by comparison, but the ones here are well-designed, and make finding features quite easy. There are a good number of chapters, but I wish they had titles for easier scene navigation, not just numbers as is the case on this volume. The criticisms notwithstanding, this is easily the finest home presentation (and a good value to boot) of a film that will remain a milestone for generations to come."	5.0	2001: A Space Odyssey (1968): A Review.	2009-01-29	10	9	1

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3HZ9IDDXB99JJ	DGlo	Just like the theme of this film, you can ponder the meaning of its issues forever. To me, that's what makes a great film -- not a neat package of pre-conceived conclusions, but something that makes you think, and continue thinking. Although it's a different genre, Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors has had the same effect on me: will you ultimately be punished by God for murder, or will you simply get away with it? Back to 2001. My own interpretation of this film (and it's just my opinion) is that the monolith can either represent God himself, alien life, or simply the representation of all time &amp; knowledge. I'm not sure it even matters -- what does matter is that when man finds the monolith, there is a radical change in evolution. It is made clear in the film that HAL knows the real reason for the mission to Jupiter: to find the monolith. I believe that HAL is afraid of what might be discovered (one possible reason is that after the next step in evolution there would be no further need for computers), so he sabatoges the mission. I'm still baffled by the ending -- perhaps when I reach the age of old Dave, I'll figure it out! The music of the film, Strauss's Zarathustra, has become a cliche already. If you want to hear some really mind-bending music, listen to the same composer's Elektra, written about ten years after Zarathustra. Interesting note: my mother actually dated Kubrick in the 1940s -- they lived in the same Bronx apartment building. Kubrick's father was a doctor; Stanley himself showed scant intellectual curiosity, other than a love for photography. My grandfather didn't think that Stanley had much of a future, so he discouraged his daughter (my mother) from any developing relationship. Now that's an enigma to ponder for all time!!	5.0	Pondering Forever	2003-09-18	5	4	1

Parts of it are interesting but each adn every scene drags on about 10 times longer than it should. There is no great plot for people to think about and the mysterious monolith is just something Kubrick put in to confuse you. This is nothing like the masterful Clockwork Orange.

This is the only film I've ever seen where the machine is more interesting than any of the human characters. It is a visual treat to watch from beginning to end, but the film doesn't make any sense.  Certain scenes are so boring you might as well watch a real-life space launch.  It could be more informative and rewarding than watching certain parts of this movie.  People have tried to debate the meaning behind behind this borefest.  They don't realize that Kubrick made the ending confusing on purpose so people could go around trying to analyze it.  They don't realize that Kubrick wanted a lot people seeing this movie.  There is no deep meaning behind it.  Kubrick just wanted to make extra bucks from people renting, buying, and seeing his movie in the theatres.	2.0	I can't make any sense out of it.	2002-04-23	13	9	4

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AVCRD98TH48RN	D. Knouse	4.5 stars.  I watched this again recently and I am still astounded at how fresh and altogether excellent the visual effects still are.  The visual effects in this film are comparable to anything being done today, surpassing most.  If for no other reason, watch this film with a particular eye for stunning visuals.  Now, that's the best thing about this movie.  Now, for the not so great.  There are a couple of ideas that look and are dated, such as wearing &quot;grip shoes&quot; to walk around any given spacecraft.  With all that we now know about being in space, in zero gravity, walking around is very impractical.  Why not just kick off a wall in whatever direction you want to go?  Why not pull yourself along a wall-pipe or handles?  What Stanley Kubrick does with the camera angles in those shots are interesting and memorable, such as having one character standing on a &quot;wall&quot; while another is sitting on the &quot;floor,&quot; but it makes more sense these days just to have them floating around.  If there was artificial gravity, the ship would have to be spinning...ah, the hindsight of The Information Age!  But at the time this film was released in theaters I couldn't possibly imagine what a fantastic effect it must have had on audiences of the time.  It was an unprecedented achievement, and except for a few moments where I thought, &quot;That wouldn't be that way in reality.,&quot;  the rest of the film is outstanding.  The last section of the film is simply amazing, filled with astounding visual effects, eerie symbolism, and some inspired direction from Stanley Kubrick.  It is truly a haunting sequence.  Overall, except for the occassional dated idea, this film shines.  This is Science Fiction at its finest.	4.0	&quot;Beyond the Infinite&quot;	2004-04-30	2	1	1

People who don't like the film usaully complain about it having no plot thus being an extreme bore to them. or they complain it was stupid and didnt make any sense. or the complain the acting sucked. The Movie wasn't meant to have an incredible story. The movie was an epic work of art. It was an example of evolution. It made such a wonderful transition from the prehistoric  past to the future. It certainly was amazing. Just how the monkeys acted was incredible. I laughed very much myself, because it showed the ignorance the monkeys had before they experienced something. The whole part where the monkey discovers how to use a weapon was amazing. After the monkey discovers how to use the object he forms his own gang and they get in a fight with the other monkeys. it was amazing.The space part did get a little tedious with its lack of story but it was extremely interesting within the visuals. There was always something going on for you to look at and be amazed by. The whole thing was a work of art. The camera angles captured a lot of the awe, and the soundtrack moved the movie right along. It was great how the mix of music and visual art went together so well.I have some kind of interpretation for the movie though. I think it was about the struggle of man vs. machine. Kubrik's future was a world run by computers. The wall was a symbol of the machine, and the sun was a symbol of light or truth. The machine blocks the sun. The machine hides the truth of emotion in a world where only humans are with error. the whole scene where Frank gets locked out of the spaceship was definately great. Then he destroys HAL. Yes most excellent. The ending was a little weird. With the baby and everything. I think the baby symbolized ignorance though. Well that's my interpretation at least.So all in all superb movie. It has become one of my favorites. It had comedy and it had drama. it was wonderful. The tension at the end was great. The visual display is amazing. THe music was superb as well. Kubrik is certainly a genious who shall be remembered for many ages.	5.0	Amazing and certainly astonishing	2005-01-03	1	1	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3HRJH47XX1N5C	"Donald J. Pangburn ""Boreal"""	Of course Kubrick and Clarke wanted us to draw our own conclusions from the text of the film.  Even without prior knowledge of the book's detailed events, one can easily interpret this film as a metaphor for evolution.Arthur C. Clarke's novel of the same name spends about 40 pages describing the lives of the ape-men and their subsequent evolution.  Whereas Kubrick's film is less suggestive about what the Monolith represents, Clarke clearly states that it was constructed by aliens.  The Monolith itself is essentially artificial intelligence--much like Hal 900 but infinitely more intelligent.  It is capable of studying, measuring, and analyzing data.  The Monolith is in other words a researcher, a pioneer in evolutionary science.  Its main function is to select highly adaptable representatives of species for the purpose of triggering evolutionary processes.  The leader of the ape-men, Moon Watcher (a metaphor for man's eternal quest), is one such test subject.  The Monolith only has to succeed with one subject for all of humanity to take a wholly different evolutionary course.  Indeed, it succeeds as we see in the film.Now, it seems to me that what Clarke was proposing is that these extraterrestrial  beings are not gods, but have god-like abilities.  The creative-force behind the universe, therefore, may very well still be God.  However, these aliens are so intellectually advanced that they have managed to escape the need for a material body and exist as pure energy; giving them God-like qualities.  They are the ones who enabled mankind to take the evolutionary leap, so to speak.Dave Bowman's own evolutionary journey, seen in both film and book, supports this idea.So, if you have any questions about the film.... read the book.  If you enjoy your own interpretation... read the book!  Its a beautiful piece of science fiction.	4.0	Read the book to better understand the film	2004-12-10	5	5	0

The film essentially defines science fiction as it was originally intended to be. There's no action, no hero or villian, no ray guns or anything that has since unfortunately become second nature with sci-fi; instead 2001 is based on ideas, and perplexing ones at that. Arthur C. Clarke is an author who frequently melds sci-fi with mysticism, and Stanley Kubrick is among the most visionary of American directors, and together they created an assault on the senses that can only be considered one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. Although the film has a tendacy to wander, (purposefully) 2001 has outstanding visuals, great music, excellent production, and special effects that still look great. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a timeless film that cannot be easily defined as it leaves the viewer enlightened with ideas.	5.0	2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) - Stanley Kubrick	2005-10-15	5	4	1

This was done before computer graphics. The pace of the film is slow and contemplative until some of the final scenes. How refreshing that was, given the hyperactivity of most video today. It gives one time to think and simply enjoy the scenes.The film's music is also compelling, as it reaches back to classical themes for space flight and for dramatic encounters. But for the monolith's appearance, we hear a large choir of human voices--singing without words. It is cogently creepy.Philosophically, two ideas stand out. First, the film tries to explain the uniqueness of human beings by invoking something unknown, but intelligently placed: the monolith. It sparks ape-like creatures to become tool-users, and weapon bearers. It then shows up on the moon, where it sends a signal to Jupiter. When scientists attempt to explain the enigma on the moon, they use a ""design inference"": it could not be what it is and be placed where it was by merely natural forces (natural laws and chance). It was consciously put there. This is the same inference used by philosophers and scientists in the Intelligent Design movement. This struck me for the first time when I watched in a few days ago.However arresting this monolithic mystery may be, it ultimately explains nothing. The author of the book, Arthur C. Clarke, was an atheist; but he seemed to know that we cannot explain human uniqueness through mindless nature. Something, someone, else is needed. But where did they come from?Second,""2001"" is a cautionary tale about technology, although created before personal computers and the Internet. The Discovery, Jupiter-bound, is run largely by HAL, a talking computer (who also gives interviews to the press). Yet HAL, for all his (artificial) intelligence, has no conscience. He puts the mission above the lives of the astronauts, only one of whom survives and outsmarts him in a poignant scene one cannot forget. ""Dave, I am losing my mind....I can feel it..."" Are we now losing our minds to technology? Has HAL landed on earth and in us?For those accustomed to rapid-action, computer-graphical, mindless films, ""200!,"" will come as a slap in the face: slow down, think, consider the meaning of life and our place in the universe."	5.0	Thought-Provoking, Beautifully Done	2013-03-06	4	4	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2B28FT4MKPZWO	DragonianWarMage	I had to watch this movie for a literary comparison between this and the short story that started the movie, The Sentinel by Arthur C. Clarke, and quite frankly the short story was 10x better and 1/100 of a waste of time. Though the content of the movie was great and interesting at the beginning, it was when there was content in this movie. I bet that if you were to take out the parts where you are just watching these people walking around in the different space ships and areas as well as the multiple scenes with the monkeys in it at the beginning of the movie would go from 2.5 hours to 45 minutes. Also, the ending was very bizzare and while I believe it was supposed to be a whole experience that Dave met the extraterrestrial life forms that made the monolith, in all reality it is more just an acid trip and I believe that there was no alien encounter, just him going nuts from taking a trip out to Jupiter without faster than light capabilities all by himself. Also, the whole segment of HAL could have been removed completely and the movie would have made more sense and been better overall. All in all worse science fiction movie in history in my opinion besides the special effects, which were incredible considering this was a film that was made in 1968 (and the reason I am giving it 1 star).	1.0	Don't be fooled, its all special effects	2013-08-05	26	5	21

Kubrick made his movies with the idea to make the viewer think, not show you what he thinks, and 2001 may be the shining example of his success. Now adays Kubrick is lumped in somewhere between Spielberg and Fellini too ""mainstream"" to qualify for elite avant-garde yet too intense and meticulous for modern movie goers. He still doesn't get the respect he deserves.With 2001 Kubrick created the zenith of science fiction films. Less a film and more of a meditation on the human condition, the film blends well known musical pieces with stark and brooding images with a near perfect accuracy. Its only misses are near the beginning, during the dawn of man the film shows its age, but luckily the scenes are at the beginning and are forgiven as the film reaches its harrowing climax.To call this a non-genre film is an understatement. The movie never goes where you expect it to go, it twists and turns and eventually stays, and watches. Suddenly you, the viewer, are simply playing witness to a series of events so surreal and dreamlike that you must simply watch and wonder.I think the biggest compliment we can give Kubrick and this  movie is the fact that 35 years after its making we are still arguing about it. There are still message boards where people come on and say ""this is the s$%tiest movie ever!!!"" and others call it a masterpiece. The fact that people spend hours contructing elaborate thoeries on the film that may or may not be what its maker meant.

Some reading deep philosphical statements into it, others falling asleep in the first 30 minutes. Man, just take it easy. It's just simply a big wonderful trip. Lean back and enjoy it. If sleeping is the way you enjoy a film (?), then do it. The best way to expierence the film, is to light up a joint before you start to watch it. A further tip (though this doesn't help sell the DVD): you have to see it &quot;on the big screen&quot;. There is nothing like sitting in a big cinema with the light smell of pot in the air and watching Space Odyssey. The music, the silence, the black screen, the funny ape-persons, wondering what the obelisk is all about, feeling kind of sorry for HAL &quot;Dave, I'm afraid.&quot; (the only figure with feelings in the film), the feeling of helplessness at the end of the film - there are so many stations on the trip, much more engaging than the Orient Express. By they way that's also the best way to watch Disneys Fantasia - another film where the question of sense and non-sense makes no sense. That's the way things are - beyond Jupiter.	5.0	Just a wonderful trip	2002-12-31	8	2	6

It should only be seen in theaters, and those that can run it in cinerama (three projectors).  Cold and dispassionate,  ""2001"" was far ahead of its time, and has a similar affect on people today  as it did when it was first released.  People love this movie, and people  hate this movie.  So do the professional critics.  Based on Arthur C.  Clarke's 1950 short story ""The Sentinel"", Clarke and Kubrick spent two  years expanding this story into a screenplay.  BTW, Clarke's novel is based  upon that screenplay.  Original set for a 1966 release, ""2001"" finally came  to the big screen in 1968.  The story is about first contact, and is unlike  anything that came before or since.  Scientifically accurate and sparse on  dialogue, this movie is a visual treat, and still holds up rather well  today (31 years after its initial release).  Between 1 and 10, ""2001"" gets  a solid 9.  I will sorely miss Stanley Kubrick and the genius of his  creations."	5.0	Kubrick&#65533;s visual masterpiece.	1999-04-10	13	10	3

It is the only movie that I know of where, because space is a vacuum, we cannot hear the roar of engines or the whiz of photon torpedoes. For those who cannot live without sound effects in space, this movie is not for you. Yes. it has a strange and totally bizarre ending that you may find confusing. But could that be the point? Might this not be an expression of the sheer absurdity of trying to capture the birth of a cosmically conscious being in ways we might understand? ... Finally, as to the monolith, I remember back when I was a child seeing this for the first time how hard it was for me to think that a big stone slab could be of any importance to anything. However, today we can see that this stone slab could easily be made of RAM. That is to say, Kubric presaged the computer revolution with a device that no longer looks so hard to believe today. Today we are besieged by stone monoliths! The metaphor has become reality...	5.0	Try the ending with Echoes	2003-05-11	5	2	3
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A18CM2NROYSFT0	Duncan C. Payne	First off - Great Movie!  Not everyone likes Brahms, Beethoven, or Stravinsky but the genius is clear.HAL's lineage streaches back to the bone.  The bone being man's first machine and HAL being the last.  HAL is  so human-like that it adopts a survival strategy when it realizes that it  is about to become obsolete.  Simply put, Man is about to leap into an  existence that does not require machines and HAL is unhappy that it cannot  come along for the ride.  HAL must be left behind because at the core, it's  perfection, memory, artificial intelligence, and circuits are only  extentions of the bone/weapon utilized by the ape-people.  HAL's mistake  (predicting the replacement part failure) becomes a trigger for a  &quot;breakdown&quot; which mimics human emotional turmoil.  HAL's  rationale of not &quot;jeapardizing the mission&quot; forces a final  confrontation between machine and Man.  Watch carefully for the aboriginal  masks of light that play over the face of the astronaut after the command  &quot;Open the pod bay doors HAL&quot;.  This is one of the most visually  cinematic sequences in film history.  It is as if Kubrik is saying;  Man in  his most primitive form is still light years more advanced than even the  most evolved computer.  Man the astronaut or the primitive will prevail.  The machine must at last, be reigned in and destroyed before man can  evolve.  There is every evidence from watching the movie that there is a  sense of revenge and enjoyment while HAL's memory is being shutdown.  The  greal HAL in the end resorts to bargaining, wimpering, and finally becoming  the fool while singing &quot;Daisy&quot;.  The machine will not be allowed  to become a &quot;real boy&quot;.  Man, right or wrong, is set for the next  adventure.  The next evolutionary step belongs to Man.  IBM, MAC, and Bill  Gates ultimately become as quaint as an ancient prehistoric bone.Thanks  for reading.	5.0	My 2 Cents - Another take on HAL	2000-03-12	16	12	4

I had never seen the film, although I really enjoy thoughtful science fiction, and I thought a hi-def, Blu-Ray viewing would be a great way to check out this classic.1. As a story, ""2001"" is not for everybody.  At 2.5 hours, it drags on.  The ape-men sequence and the whole thing with the black monolith and time warps (or whatever that was) are just a bit ""weird"" (that's the technical term my wife uses) for many viewers.2. As ""cinema"" there are many elements of ""2001"" that were groundbreaking in 1968 and are still classic today.  Much of the music, HAL, the vision of space travel, the musing on what is out there in the universe for mankind to discover, remain thought-provoking even today.3. As a viewing experience, ""2001"" on Blu-Ray was amazing.  How well can one reasonably expect a science fiction movie from 1968 to translate to the modern hi-def home theater with surround sound?  This disc exceeds any reasonable expectation.  ""2001"" on Blu-Ray looks and sounds better than many of my Blu-Ray discs of movies that were released in theaters since, say, 2001!  Visually amazing, and the sound track is a real treat for audiophiles.  ""2001"" has much of the look and feel of the Star Wars universe, but pre-dates it by a decade and treats it more seriously and is less cartoonish than Star Wars.In sum:  Not for the whole family, but a ""must see"" for serious sci-fi fans and hi-def aficionados."	4.0	Strange Movie, But Amazing Technical Achievement for 1968!	2008-02-17	2	1	1

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3IKSXORTDGVH5	Edmond Gauthier	"Stanley Kubrick's life as a director can easily be charted in an up and down graph that looks like one large (if not evenly measured) pyramid.The up side begins from his start with a few documentaries, then rises quickly with The Killing (1956), and Paths of Glory (1957). It then soars to his peak with masterpieces like Spartacus (1960), Lolita (1962), and Dr. Strangelove (1964).The Kubrick career chart shows its first slowdown, however, with the dull, plodding 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), which irked many film goers by its refusal to explain, among other things, what the heck those dumb ""monoliths"" at the end were supposed to mean. From then on things went even more downhill for him. A Clockwork Orange (1971) was a muddled mess of sexism and violence, Barry Lyndon (1975) was a snore-inducing swashbuckler that buckled under Kubrick's bad decision to use ""available light"" in most shots, The Shining (1980) was a weak attempt at horror (certainly not Kubrick's style at all), even prompting Shining author Stephen King to later do his own version of the script (1997).Then came Full Metal Jacket (1987), a piece of belated back-biting (produced about 15 years too late) about the Vietnam war, and his finale flop, Eyes Wide Shut (1999), starring the sickeningly sweet married couple Cruise and Kidman, failing miserably to look sexually daring.Had he lived, another even worse bomb was next up for him, called A.I. (2001). It was such an overdone can of stale spam that even the great Steven Spielberg (a celebrated sci-fi movie veteran) couldn't save it, when he later finished it for Kubrick. (Ya, he finished it off, that is!)In short, Kubrick should have stopped right after Dr. Strangelove."	3.0	2001: The First Chink In Kubrick's Armor	2004-12-04	17	3	14

Before going, I first read The Sentinel by Arthur C. Clarke (the original inspiration for the movie).  I also read the screenplay and Arthur C. Clarke's novelization of the movie.  Let me tell you, they didn't help me one little bit.  At the viewing, I was utterly mystified and so was the audience (given to vocalizing their confusion loudly).As an artist, I find this movie absolutely stunning.  It's a pleasure to view (I've watched and enjoyed it many times).  But.  However engrossing the imagery, the lack of a coherent story is maddening.  I appreciate that Kubrick wanted this to be a contemplative experience, but as a person who craves a linear structure, I am still annoyed and baffled by the vague ending.Obviously, after all these years, I still haven't come to an understanding of what this film was meant to represent.  Yes, I get the whole ""dawn of man"" bit and the jump to a future that never happened.  It's the stuff after Jupiter that still makes no sense whatsoever.  And quite frankly, I don't want to come up with my interpretation; I want to know Kubrick's and Clarke's intent, because that's what I paid for.........a complete story.  What they delivered (or didn't) is a bit of a cheat.  I'm not about to be analyzed and asked what I think it means.  This isn't a Rorschach Test, it's a film.  There are certain obligations that a filmmaker is supposed to meet when he puts forth a film.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1MFGO518GH1WL	Emale	In 1968, Stanley Kubrick and this film surfaced the idea of extra terrestrials engaging and stimulating intelligent life on Earth. By triggering the latent intellect of an otherwise threatened family of ape primates, these were then able to rise above threatening tribes to succeed in their environment, learn the way of the weapon to kill for food and thus) become the Human Race. This really is the ultimate blend of Creationism and Evolution right there on the screen ... in 1968. These imbued Apes took it from there and went to the stars. An altogether shocking concept in its time and an amazing idea even today. Five stars is simply not enough.The theme has since had numerous variations and twists but this was the original.	5.0	Ground Breaking In It's Time	2008-03-03	0	0	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1C6RGCXL7S4W	emanuel goldstein	Be an individual for gods sake people.  I can understand how some people would like this movie since they have grown up with people hailing the movie as a classic but really, come on, the movie is very poor.  To beging with none of the concepts are original, evolution and space travel were alredy ideas, all this movie is is putting it into visual form, and in a very poor manner.  It is a very empty movie, i feel that if people want good science-fiction watch starwars, if you want to learn about evolution, read darwins book, and if you are into space travel, well.. there is a alot of better documentations on space travel out there.  The problem i raise about this movie is that in all three catagories it can be beat out!  So why watch this movie which does a poor job of explaining all three!

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AA9BJVIUL0Z1S	Emurda	An epic of unparalleled scope, this film traces the entire evolution of the human species.  The special effects are amazing even today and are all the more amazing considering this was filmed in the '60s.  Some of the scenes depicting weightlessness are mind-boggling, especially the one where David must blow himself back into the escape hatch.  It's visually stunning and has a realistic feel that today's cartoony CGI films are lacking.  The soundtrack is incredible, perhaps the greatest ever.  This film is simply a masterpiece.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AQZH7YTWQPOBE	Enjolras	"I fully understand 2001's place in the history of cinema. Both in terms of narrative and special effects, it is an important movie. However, make no mistake - this is primarily a special effects movie. The ""philosophical"" elements aren't particularly deep - the reasons audiences have to puzzle over it is because the film is so ambiguous. The film doesn't develop a tight plot, but rather strings together a series of images that tell an abstract story. For 1968, these special effects were amazing. I can understand why audiences enjoyed long periods of silence as a chance to appreciate images of space or depictions of zero-G. However, nowadays the effects look dated, so spending 10 minutes starting at a spaceship docking or watching a stewardess walking in a ship just doesn't have as much appeal. If you want to enjoy the majesty of space, nowadays there are so many documentaries, images, and other sources. Overall, the film has its moments (HAL is still the creepiest computer run amok in science fiction). Still, as much as I really want to love this film, every time I watch it I feel like I'm watching an outdated special effects montage."	3.0	Hasn't aged well	2009-07-23	0	0	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AV9QZ73RXM0Z3	"Eric Anderson ""Arsenic Drone"""	2001: A Space Odyssey is worth seeing, because you'll understand references and be able to make conversation about it. However, you might not enjoy watching it. There were a few things I really liked about it, but I wouldn't say that I had a good time watching the film.That's not to say that I particularly regret spending the time (it is a bit lengthy) to watch it. Afterwards it is interesting to mull over some of the themes, and develop your own take on it. I won't be so pompous as to try to feed you my interpretation of the meaning, because there are too many ways you could explain each thing. However, as vague as the metaphors are, I feel that Kubrick beats the viewer over the head with them. The phallic object(s), the question of whether or not man is special, &quot;man's first instinct,&quot; and so on: I don't know about everyone else, but I felt like Kubrick tried a bit too hard to make his themes clear. I didn't know anything about the film beforehand, so I wasn't primed to come in and analyze everything. However, when the message and substance are so blatant (even if you can't be sure quite what they are), you are forced to self-consciously think about the movie while watching it. &quot;Ugh, I've been watching birth imagery for the last five minutes,&quot; you think, and it detracts from the experience. Even if you realize you might be wrong.The themes are certainly interesting questions, interesting things to think about. And I'm not saying that they're presented in a shock-value sort of way. Without dialogue, action, and dynamic camera work, though, when the artistic parts come up and come on so strong, it's just overkill. The ending sequence is particularly guilty of this. Everything is metaphor, and Kubrick chose some rather mundane ways to represent the grandiose, almost as if he thinks no one will have any clue what's going on otherwise. &quot;Oh, come on, a bathtub?&quot; you may find yourself griping.As for the claims that the movie is boring, they may go a bit too far, but there is some validity to them. Certainly some scenes are most effective when they're stretched out longer than you'd expect. At least for me, Kubrick stretched them out far longer than was necessary. Given the flavor of the film, long sit-back-and-enjoy-the-beauty scenes seem out of place while you're trying to discover out what's going on, and they end long after you've taken it all in.In all, if you enjoy your thought-provoking experiences coming in story form, you'll be disappointed. If you like to change how you view the world slowly, and don't take well to things that try to blow your mind, you'll be disappointed. If you're not interested in an experiment in film pace, you'll be disappointed. If you'd rather have fun watching a movie, and do the deep thinking later, you'll be disappointed. See the movie I suppose, but there will be many things that will make you want to roll your eyes.	3.0	It's an influential movie, but it's got its flaws.	2003-02-10	12	3	9

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AVQJD41PLPOOQ	Eric F.	...by my favorite director of all time (we miss you Stanley).This is the timeless story of man's ultimate journey with an alien intelligence that has been with us since the dawn of man.  It has some of the most spectacular special effects and color sequences for its time and is beautifully blended with classic musical scores.  Having been released in 1968, it ushed in our own space odyssey, when Americans walked on the moon just one year later.I won't lie to you.  If you've never seen this movie before, you'll likely hate it.  It's slow, with no speed or action and very little dialogue.  I challange you, though, to watch it again, several times, even, until you (hopefully) see the cinematic genius behind it that only Stanley Kubrick could deliver!Give it a chance.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A20ASR095FA6IV	Eric Hewlett	I just saw this movie and it hurts me that anyone would define this movie as lazy. There is a great deal to say about this movie weather one has taken their Prozac or Ritalin pill or not. This movie is a deeply serine movie, that does not have that much action although there are some interesting parts to the movie that are quite suspenseful. The pain staking time it took to conceive of such beautiful visualizations and scenery is amazing. Good movie making can be seen as the ability to show a story not tell a story. These breath taking images tell a thousand times more than any words could possibly capture, combining with such melodious music forming a poetry of visual effects. While I watched this, however, I did whish that I had a fast forward button, and do understand that the plot itself can be summed up in less than three minutes. This movie is not to be watched when your wide awake and want to go play football, this is a movie to substitute for watching the sun set, the waves crashing at the beach, or reading a peaceful book on a warm sunny afternoon. We could criticize the creator for being so simplistic in making the sun rise so boring an non eventful or we can marvel at the spectacular show of light to be seen, a wonderful way to end a day. This movie is like a sun set, it makes you think its not taxing on your soul with killing, blood and sex, its like watching a leaf fall from a tree,  getting caught up by the wind, and being wisped away. Something simple and yet the physics behind it are very complex.This film is truly either thus best accomplishment or the worst failure of the film industry but no more so than a sunset, which can be either completely tiresome, slow to the point and boring, or in another instance beautiful timeless and awe-inspiring.	4.0	Fantasia meets Sci-Fi	2002-04-14	6	6	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A32KDMHSL6QDC5	Eric McCoy	For anyone who wants to see a traditional sci-fi movie, 2001 is not for you.  It has almost no dialogue, less action, and no easily-identifiable plot worth mentioning.  My opinion - and, I hope, also the opinion of the  filmmakers - is that this movie works hard to transcend these standard  aspects to deliver what is, more than any other movie I have ever seen, a  truly emotional experience.When I first saw the movie (I was about 10 at  the time), I, like several other viewers, was horribly bored.  But upon  watching it (on TV) years later, with a bit more patience and willingness  to &quot;work&quot; at understanding it, I found it an amazingly compelling  work.  I was shocked at the depth of the experience, the scope of the story  (yes, there really is a story!), and how it almost subliminally conveyed  its message by stunning musical and visual effects._Contact_ at its best  is able only to mimic the sheer breathless wonder of space; 2001 replicates  it perfectly and astoundingly.  The more I watch Contact, the more annoyed  I get at how the writers felt that Jodie Foster's continued statements  about sending a poet entirely kill the scene.  With this perspective comes  the realization that 2001 manages its power through the conspicuous absence  of dialogue.I truly wish I had been able to see this movie in the  theater, to get the total feel of it.  Nevertheless, watching 2001 in a  darkened room with no distractions is still incredible.I find myself  obliged to borrow from what other reviewers have said about 2001: if you  want to see a work of art, you must see 2001.  If you want to see a movie,  perhaps you would be better off elsewhere.  In any case, be warned: if you  see 2001 and enjoy it, you will find yourself unfavorably comparing it to  every other sci-fi movie you see.	5.0	Challenging from the get-go.	1999-10-22	8	8	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	"NOTE: This review contains major spoilers.....The late Stanley Kubrick has to be my favorite director of all time. He was the director of five of my top favorite films: Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, & Full Metal Jacket. I can acknowledge that he was a very sophisticated perfectionist, but I can never deny that most of his movies are unbelievably mesmerizing. These are the exact kinds of films that I can never look away from. I feel almost hypnotized by them. But out of all of Kubrick's films, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that works the most wonders. It's the finest sci-fi epic ever made, and it's officially my #1 favorite film of all time.But what exactly makes 2001 so special? Well, in my opinion, it has perfected the sci-fi genre. Before this film was ever released, people have never completely taken science fiction very seriously. In the 50's and early 60's, sci-fi films often had crude special effects and silly storylines. Most of them (The Thing from Another World, The Day The Earth Stood Still) had very good plots and decent effects, but as a whole, the look and feel of these motion pictures still lacked realism and importance. Keep in mind, I don't have anything against the 50's and 60's sci-fi classics, but they are not my personal favorites, either. So along came 2001: A Space Odyssey. Released in 1968, critics were sharply divided. Some said it was fantastic, while others believed it to be dull. But this film grew among audiences (especially the psychedelic kinds), and slowly, people have acknowledged this to be not only the greatest sci-fi film ever made, but also one of the greatest films ever made. The year is now 2010, and this film is still considered to be a classic, which is a bit surprising since a majority of moviegoers are now accustomed to over-the-top action and pointless comedies. Hey, I still like some over-the-top action, but comedies nowadays aren't very clever anymore. Anyway, back to 2001. The reason why this film is so brilliant is that it became a sci-fi revolution. It's entirely distinctive for its realistic special effects, serious storyline, and influence on space travel & evolution. Even when compared to Star Wars, Star Trek, and Stargate, 2001 still looks and feels completely different from the rest. Look at how slow and steady the spaceships move. Listen to the lack of sound in the vacuum of space. Observe the planets and stars and how realistic they actually look. I don't think I have ever seen another sci-fi film that was ever this scientifically accurate before.Critics and audiences have analyzed this movie ever since it was released. Some believe it to be an ode to science, while others see it as an example of alien intelligence. Some even believe that it is about God and the paradise that we yearn for (the last thirty minutes of the film). As a middle-of-the-road agnostic, I think this film is about everything. Even if the main point of the film remains mysterious, it seems to explore everything about space and the future. The black monolith could either symbolize God, Darwinism, or alien benevolence & intelligence. HAL 9000 could represent the errors of future technology, or the cause and effects of artificial intelligence. The last twenty minutes of the film, in which David Bowman grows old and is reborn as the star-child, could be seen as a religious experience. But even if all of these were true, 2001 is ""still a total mystery."" We don't really know what it's all about. What really works, I think, is how these possible representations are shown through images and sound. The messages can be very clear once the visuals can make you understand what they are.And speaking of visuals, the special effects still don't cease to amaze me. I don't think I have ever seen such real-looking effects (and this was WAY before computers were used). It's a bit obvious that the apes in the first fifteen minutes of the film are on a soundstage, but the space sequences are such a delight to watch. The spaceships look almost as if they were really moving in space, and the planets Earth & Jupiter don't look like miniature models at all (perhaps they were matte paintings of photographs, I can't really tell). And how did they manage to have Frank Poole float away in space? They must have used a wide-angle lens for that. And just how DID they create that famous ""stargate"" sequence? I know they used macro photography for some shots, but what did they use for the other shots? There are just so many questions that maybe it's time for me to listen to the audio commentary.As an avid fan of classical music, I really do love the classical pieces that were chosen for this film. 2001 does not have an original score, but the music of J. Strauss, R. Strauss, Ligeti, and Khachaturian always get to me. Every musical piece is used to actually enhance the story. Ligeti's ""Requiem"" signifies the presence of the black monolith. J. Strauss's ""The Blue Danube"" is played during two scenes involving space travel. Khachaturian's ""Gayane: Adagio"" is heard when we begin to see what goes on during the Jupiter Mission. And of course, R. Strauss's ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" is used to remind us how majestic the universe really is. Basically, the music really does add more importance to the story. ""The Blue Danube"" is starting to get on my nerves, though.Well, this is it. This is my all-time favorite film. I can name at least a hundred films that I really admire (such as The Godfather and Collateral), but this is the one that I admire the most. Everything about it is barely above perfection. It may be too slow and tedious for some people, but to me, it's an excellent visual spectacle. As for the 2-Disc Special Edition DVD, I would highly recommend it. It has some fascinating special features, including an audio commentary by actors Keir Dullea (Bowman) and Gary Lockwood (Poole), the original theatrical trailer, and seven behind-the-scenes featurettes. The picture quality of the film itself looks a bit different. About ten years ago, I bought the film on VHS. The picture quality on that cassette tape was surprisingly clear, and the light/dark bits were about correct. Since I no longer have a VCR, I decided to buy the DVD, and while I was watching the film, I saw the difference. Compared to the VHS, the picture on the DVD does look dimmer. It's obvious when the ""stargate"" sequence is on: for example, the original blue colors convey some heavy shades of gray. Another noticeable change is the introduction and the intermission: the words ""Overture"" and ""Entr'acte"" have been taken off the screen completely. So Ligeti's ""Atmospheres"" plays while there is nothing but black on the screen. Fortunately, I wouldn't decide these sorts of things as flaws since I don't really mind them. I'm glad that I made the purchase, and furthermore, I'm glad that I now have my all-time favorite film in my own DVD collection.Grade: A+"	5.0	"""Its origin and purpose.....still a total mystery."""	2010-02-04	9	8	1

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2D8CUJPOSRPNA	Erik North	When it comes to revolutionizing the way people think of movies, Stanley Kubrick had few peers.  His 1968 sci-fi epic 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is proof of that.  Although its bold predictions have proven to be less than spectacular in reality (owing to Vietnam, Watergate, the Cold War, etc.), &quot;2001&quot; holds up as a triumphant piece of cinema even today.  Kubrick's collaboration with science fiction writing great Arthur C. Clarke (whose short story &quot;The Sentinel&quot; was the film's starting point), which ostensibly began as an attempt to make &quot;the proverbial good science fiction movie&quot;, obviously turned into something a bit more.When it was unleashed in 1968, &quot;2001&quot; precipitated a torrent of controversy.  Its extreme length (139 minutes), its very deep plot, the very limited dialogue (40 minutes), and a mind-blowing ending really ticked off critics who expected something much more conventional.  But the film's story of Man meeting his equal (or Master) in the universe, spanning millions of years, gave inspiration to a lot of filmmakers, including of course Steven Spielberg.An Oscar winner for Special Effects (an award it couldn't possibly have lost), &quot;2001&quot; was followed sixteen years later by a sequel--&quot;2010&quot;--that turned out to be a far better movie than anyone had the right to expect.	5.0	Revolutionary Cinema	2001-07-10	7	4	3

This is not to take away from the undeniably huge achievement and enduring legacy of the film. Certainly, the first and last 15 minutes are some of the most incredibly mind expanding sequences in cinematic history, as well as being just beautifully filmed (as is the entire film, actually). However, the film does not flow well during the middle sequences and seems to plod along at some points. It's almost as if Kubrick is content to let the stunning special effects/cinematography take the place of narrative or dialogue. One other problem is that the moon travel sequence with Haywood Floyd appears very dated, almost screaming ""this is a 1960s movie interpretation of the future!"". While it was not an issue in the first few years after release, it certainly is now. If only Kubrick had avoided the less imaginative approach taken here (as well as the product placements) he would have come that much closer to perfection. Who knows, maybe that was Clarke's influence. Wouldn't it be ironic that such a visionary futurist would end up making the film look dated?But getting past that, let's take an obligatory look at the wonderfully enigmatic ending, and some other issues that will forever be a source of debate among those who love this film. As for HAL 9000 (I have heard that the the acronym HAL was chosen since each letter precedes IBM in the alphabet) I think this was indeed the Mary Shelley idea of man creating a monster through technology. How could anything created by the mind of man be perfect? Recall the ominous close-ups of HAL's ""pale yellow eye"" and you get the message loud and clear. Interestingly enough, when Joe Hyam's mundane sequel to this movie appeared in 1984 titled ""2010"", we learned that HAL went nuts because he was programmed that way...by man. So the computer as an entity was vindicated as PCs were proliferating.One of the most memorable moments of the film for me is when Dave ""kills"" HAL, and a pre-recorded video pops up on a nearby screen. It is Haywood Floyd explaining the reason for the mission. This scene never fails to give me goosebumps. Rarely, if ever in movie history is there a greater object of human isolation as our astronaut Dave Bowman at that moment. This is followed by the mind-blowing journey ""beyond the infinite"" sequence. I don't pretend to know what Kubrick was doing here. Maybe even he didn't know completely, but the aging and rebirth may well be symbolic of the unavoidable need to evolve that humans, like all species, are required to do to avoid extinction. And that's as far as I can go with that..."	4.0	Science Meets Creation	2005-02-12	2	1	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A27O23E7XY3E9S	"""est11728"""	This is still the greatest sci-fi movie ever made even after 34 years....it is a contender for the greatest movie of all time.In 1968, this film all but wiped the floor with its predecessors (mostly clunky 50's aliens v mankind movies)and set the standard for intelligent, thoughtful forward looking space mysteries. It is these ingredients of this cinematic watershed, which have confounded viewers ever since and its uniqueness has ensured that the makers of all subsequent &quot;space fiction&quot; movies can never attain the same perspective again.What is truly astonishing is that when this film was made, mankind hadn't even stepped on the moon. Watching the film today, it is hard to appreciate the incredible forsight of its makers. Few films since have managed to convey convincingly (with the possible exception of Apollo 13) the vast expanse of space and man's helplessness within it.Of course the film has a legendary philosophical undertone and touches on matters considered &quot;pre-ordained&quot; by the makers. It is this poetic beauty which transforms the film into something truly spectacular. The long silent passages in space accompanied only by the sound of breathing are moments of genious which have never been repeated since and without doubt won't be in today's rampant market for high-tech gadget ridden noisy fun-for-all dominated sci-fi genre.It is hard to imagine that there will ever be another film-maker like Kubrick who can work without the influence of major studios or production companies to push the boundaries of the medium as far as Kubrick did with this film.Some people have tried too hard to understand this film when the object was always to experience it....if only it was shown on a large screen more often...	5.0	MASTERWORK BY TRUE VISIONARY	2002-07-05	3	3	0

This film is much like art in motion due to the excellent use of widescreen. But this movie does really have to do with your taste in film, if your looking for an epic intergalactic battle with non-stop action then looks elsewhere. The effects are phenomenal for a movie made in 1968, especially for the excellent models and the infamous closing scene's effects in the film.INTERESTING FACT*: The screenplay was written primarily by Kubrick and the novel primarily by Clarke, each working simultaneously and also providing feedback to the other. As the story went through many revisions, changes in the novel were taken over into the screenplay and vice versa. It was also unclear whether film or novel would be released first; in the end it was the film. Kubrick was to have been credited, as second author of the novel, but in the end was not. It is believed that Kubrick deliberately withheld his approval of the novel as to not hurt the release of the film.*Source IMDB	4.0	One of Kubricks Finest, A Classic Sci-Fi.	2003-11-03	0	0	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A11JSOM64E8MAS	Evelyn	2001 a space odyssey is a film that is not for everyone. Many may find it slow or pretentious, but for some it will prove to be one of, if not the most, poetic, hypnotic, and consuming experiences to be had with cinema.With special effects that are still mind blowing after 40 years, one does get the feeling that perhaps Kubrick some how acquired a time machine.The greatest film from one of history's great directors.

I can see why some people hate it while at the same time I can see why people love it. I fall in the latter since it is one of the very best films Ive seen.As for the extras, the biggest and most interesting surprise is the commentary done by Gary Lockwood and Keir Dullea. They were not together when they recorded it but both give absolutely fascinating accounts of their filmmmaking experiences in this film. Most actors doing commentaries aren't that interesting but it is very much worth listening in on what they have to say. A great addition to this DVD.As for the rest, the documentaries are terrific. Finally, a decent 'making of' documentary. I had never seen one before and it is almost criminal that a film of this magnitude has not had a special edition of this scope done before. The innovation in making this film is simply extraordinary. The simplicity of what they do is in stark contrast to the brilliance. I could not believe how they did some of those effects and yet it was entirely convincing. They still hold up to this day.I still cannot get enough of this film, I love it, it is a masterpiece.	5.0	A great special edition of 2001	2007-10-23	5	5	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A5XPDL3YBFV1M	Fantasy Fan	First off, I'd like to say that the movie wasn't ALL bad.  The special effects were groundbreaking and brilliant (for its time).  HAL was a great villain-chillingly merciless, coldly impersonal, ruthlessly killing.  And the story, horribly confusing as it was, was original and creative.But that in no way pardons the rest of the film.  The first time I tried watching it, I gave up halfway through, went upstairs, and watched a video of Abott and Costello.  The second time I was subjected to this movie was as moral support for my sister, also wading into this mess for the second time, to clock how long the sequences were-(I AM NOT KIDDING!  WE TIMED THE MOVIE!)-and to show our friend what an awful movie it was.All three of us felt our brains melting out during the tedious process of wasting two hours and fifteen minutes of our lives.If you're planning on buying this movie, on DVD or VHS, regular or Special Edition, please reconsider until you know for sure whether you like films like this or not.It's not that I don't appreciate art.  I love a good film that has profound messages, brilliant cinematography, and great directing.  I enjoy films like that.I just don't think 2001 is one of them.	1.0	Don't believe the hype-this is the worst movie EVER!	2006-08-12	41	8	33
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A23KIGPZ05D3W9	"Far_Isle ""Far_Isle"""	I was just a year old when this film first ran in theaters worldwide.  It took me until I was about 10 years old to see it, and even then, after Star Wars and Close Encounters, though I could not understand 2001 completely, I knew, somewhere down inside, it was something great.  Now, after having seen it 7 or 8 times in my adulthood, I have come to realize, through all of the hidden connections, consistencies, and deliberate silence, that this is indeed the greatest film of all time.  If you can disconnect from the need for high volume, fast blitz, wordy onslaughts, explosives and car chases, you will experience something you have never known.  On the largest screen you can find, with no interruptions from the outside world, sit in silence and listen, watch, and think.  Because this picture forces you to think.  The lack of dialogue is deliberate.  The ominous silence is deliberate.  The forces and confusion are also on purpose.  By entering this film, you enter the monolith itself.  The stone has the knowledge and only by letting it touch you, and you touch it, does that power of insight pass on.  By the time the grande finale appears, you have been moved from your small space in the room in which you sit, to the expanding vastness of the universe itself.  This is the greatest film of all time and when you have reached it final silence - you will understand that for yourself.	5.0	Dave But Not Bowman	2008-02-25	0	0	0

Admittedly the film is rather boring on the whole but I'd still watch those lands being filmed through a kaleidoscope any day and all those psychedelic images as well. They really make the film. And also maybe what detracts the film these days is that everyone has copied scenes in it to death that what probably seemed groundbreaking at the time now seems rather jaded because of the endless copying and that it eventually becomes worthless. Kubrick is a good director though, his films are usually very good. And this probably was - probably is given the amount of directors who are influenced by him and all but I can't really say I enjoyed this film because there's nothing worse than saying &quot; Oh I saw that somewhere before &quot;Perhaps it one of those movies that people would have said &quot; You just had to be there man at the beginning &quot; because I certainly wasn't	3.0	A sci-fi movie that has a whiff of a joke being played	2003-10-07	14	2	12
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3RQ9A9PRWZXAL	findkeep@eburg.com	2001 is a film that has affected me in a profound way, and I've recently realized that I don't know, nor do I want to know why.  Before the words your reading now this review was a jargonous attempt at making sense of a film that had changed my perception in a radical way.  But recently, and for no apparent reason, I was hit with a series of questions.  One,... why?  Two,... did it matter?  And three,... were all those ridiculous interpretations really responsible for the emotion and awe this film inspired in me?And so, as I can not delete my previous review, I write this now.  As an example of pure cinema as possibility, I really feel that 2001 should not be limited, but expanded.  Perhaps the larger and greater we make it, the closer we come to why and how it effects us so.  Is it merely the symbolic shape of a space ship, or the vast wonder of not knowing, not being able to explain or control the feelings invoked?  2001 has raised film, ART, to heights far greater than anything achieved before or since.  It is film as a visual, aural, and emotional expirience that transcends verbal thought.  It captures the wonder man must have felt when he first looked up to the stars.	5.0	Kubrick Was Inspired by Angels	2001-08-22	3	0	3

First of all, this is the system that I used:Panasonic AE500 720p high def front projector displaying on a 96"" diagonal widescreen . Definitive Technology BP2002 towers for fronts, CLR2002 center channel, BP2X surrounds, PF15TL subwoofer, Denon AVR3300 AV receiver and Toshiba A2 HD-DVD player. I watched the HD-DVD version last night and was just blown away! The first thing I noticed was the audio. Instead of a dull, lifeless soundtrack as on the standard DVD, this one actually has excellent dynamic range, clarity and some pretty darn good bass. The channel separation is decent as well, but the surround channels are barely noticeable and are probably only used for a touch of ambiance. When the signature theme song, Also sprach Zarathustra, begins, you can literally feel the bass notes rising in your seat and gut until the powerful climax. It sent chills through my spine! The audio is finally of a quality befitting to this masterpiece of a film. The video is also outstanding. Unfortunately, my Panasonic projector is a three year old LCD model and as such, has a hard time reproducing blacks. The blacks are actually a dark gray, and of course this movie has a lot of space shots which require good black levels. The projector couldn't reproduce these accurately, but that is not at all due to the movie transfer. The lighter scenes are where the Panny shines, and this movie has so much color and detail in it that I've never noticed before. The minute details of Dave Bowman's red spacesuit are crystal clear, and the pores on his face are easily seen. The pod bay scenes were so clear and lifelike it was like looking through a window. I find it hard to describe how much detail and clarity are visible in this HD-DVD. In my opinion it is reference caliber. I will use this to demo my home theater, especially after I upgrade to a new projector that is capable of good black levels.  If you enjoy HD, you must add this one to your collection."	5.0	This is 2001 as it was meant to be seen!	2007-11-18	4	3	1

I guess you can't debate which was the last almost purely intellectual sci-fi movie.believe it or not, I've been watching 2001 for a long time now - not just say the last few weeks or so before writing this review.  Why I decide to wright this review now?  I don't know!Perhaps another curiosity about 2001 being the last purely intellectual sci fi movie is that Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov's sci-fi are still pretty much the best.  There's ""The Daimond Age"" and a few curiosities like ""the Turing option""; but, for the most part, they're sci-fi is still the best. Similarly, maybe, there hasn't been any E.T. Bell's to wright the mathematics done in the twentieth century. After the sixties british bluesrockers, there hasn't been anybody to follow in their shoes(yes, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, but also, John Mayall's bluesbreakers, Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, the Doors,); seems, that times have changed.  Times change, and we don't seem to get the same inspired people. Humanity almost certainly will stumble into the future.  All we can hope for is that mankind establishes themselves in space; out there, mankind's survival is almost assured. This gets to more of the issues of 2001!Arthur C. Clarke's 2001 starts with pre-technological dependent apelike species who becomes dependent on technology and hence science.  Arthur C. Clarke makes a problematical mechanism for these non-technological species to become scientific conscious(or, at least along the path towards scientific consciousness) by means of an Extraterrestrial something that can cross the distances of the stars.  Question, how did they become technological?  How did they manage to get sophisticated enought to cross the stellar distances?  Perhaps, he answers these in his Rama series; first one way, and then another; oh well, he was getting old!To say the least, I generally enjoy reading that first chapter even more than watching it; but, i do enjoy watching the movie.  Watching 2001 is like going through an art gallery.  You stop and try to find some meaning at one picture after another.  The two major scenes of the let's say pre-science scenes are the slight slither of the moon crescent at sunset; see if you've missed it(if you don't know what I'm talking about, you've missed it!).  I always enjoy noticing such thin slices of the moon during the day; i've often found the moon in daylight like that!  The other major still of the pre-science scenes was the monolith with the sun shining down on it; you see this scene again on the moon before the Monolith gives off its radio shrill to Jupiter's big brother monolith.After Moonwalker 'kills' his arch nemesis from the other ape-group in perhaps one of the most gruesome murder scenes ever done in all of hollywood, Moonwalker throws up the bone in triumph, and we go into a technological future humanity still isn't quite at yet!The bone turns into a orbiting satellite.  Only this orbiting satellite, if you read the book, is actually an orbiting laser platform.  I don't want to get into much of the pre-Hall spaceship space scenes.  But, the fact that Arthur C. Clarke puts a subplot of humanity about to destroy itself before making contact with E.T, actually created a bit of confusion in the minds of readers and watchers of 2001.  What is the movie about?  Is it about the human species going from non-scientific to scientific, to an undreamt of future?  Or, is it about E.T.'s saving us from ourselves?  I pick the former for the most part. The whole space lasers subplot weakens the book a bit for me. I'd hate to further rationalize my feelings about it; i just don't feel the necessity.2001 tried to make a scientific spirited sci-fi experience.  It also got into space; here, they tried to convey something of what it's like to be in space(a bit hard at the time; they hardly had good video of being in orbit around the Earth; they hadn't got to the moon yet, much less Jupiter).  This part bores the impatient out of their minds.  They don't get the story from the beginning; and then, they're straight bored for over half an hour!  In the book, there's all kinds of scientific curiosities pointed out like how the radio is a remarkable technology that nobody thinks twice about anymore; a whole host of technologies including exotic moon stations. At this point, 2001 is more like a ride through Disney world then a stroll through an art gallery. And then some serious conversation!Heyward Floyd makes a speach to the moon monolith geologists.  He says military bearing must be kept at all times; this means, no mentioning of the monolith to anybody.  Why? His, and presumably his leaders down on Earth, think that telling the population about E.T.'s and a strange technology that has defeated their best possible technology might create a few heart attacks.  It might change people's minds about their religions; it might do all kinds of things!  People might go rioting and rapping and pillaging.  Who knows!?  I'm not to sure where I stand; but, it is a main bone of contention of the movie.Arthur C Clarke's Hal scenes show two mature people who wouldn' hurt a fly.  You would think the A.I. wouldn't hurt a fly either.  The Hal scenes are interesting from many different points.  Arthur C. Clarke is on the one hand trying to show humanity going from barbaric to mature scientific curiosity; and then, he's got the irrational military bearing arguement to not let humanity know about the discovery of E.T.'s, and then, he tries to convey the dangers of technology perhaps, that A.I. might turn irrational(he mentions the names of Marvin Minsky . . . who wrote ""the Turing Option"" as noted above  . . . and Douglass Hofstadter in the book; two main A.I. researchers of the twentieth century). Maybe he just wanted to make the space scenes to Jupiter more cinema exciting.  I don't think he should have made Hal go crazy; he should have done more intellectual activities between Hal and his two mature scientific curiosity spirited people on board.  He did many interesting space repair work like x-ray trouble shooting of electronic gear; surelly, Arthur C. Clarke could have thought of more nifty technology and scientific things to mention and show!But, Clarke did do some great creative and legendary cinema by dealing with a haywire Hal; he had  I think it was Bowman go through the airlock with no helmet!  Here, we see that Arthur C. Clarke's choice to tone down the rational scientific spirit pathway led to problems!  Everyone knows that the astronaut would have died on impact with the vacuum.  The succeeding scenes are also legendary and don't need repeating. Ultimately, Bowman makes it to Jupiter to confront Big Brother monolith.  As is said in 2010 and not in 2001 unfortunately, ""My god, it's full of stars!""Bowman sees the wonders of a learned species and gets turned into a transhuman.  Why Bowman gets to become this enlightened imortal state and not the rest of the human species I don't know!  I guess Bowman got to be the chosen one. I bring this up because to me, one of the not thought about, I would say mistakes of the god believers of humanity is that god's are made up by each culture to give them land and conquer their enemies; ultimately, they are made to make a covenant with god; believe in him as the chosen ones, and he'll(male god; there's asherahs, or God's wife in the old testament; but, the males who made up the text make ""God"" destroy all the asherahs) get rid of the evil other cultures.  And here, Arthur C. Clarke is making a chosen one over all others of the humans; no effort to try to give them a chance to maybe rethink their positions.It's amazing to me that nobody ""get's"" the starchild scence.  I'll not even comment on the last StarChild scenes!  What are they lazy?  Can't read the book?  Can't think for themselves?"	3.0	2001 - the last intellectual sci-fi movie	2012-05-24	6	3	3
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1XOZW9A8TL7JY	Four Star Film Fan	I have to admit that this sci-fi film directed by Stanley Kubrick left me feeling let down. The movie itself is split up into four parts, the first beginning in the prehistoric era with a group of apes. Over time a mysterious structure appears and the apes learn how to make tools. From there it cuts to the exploration of space where man goes to Jupiter and beyond with the help of HAL 9000, a skilled but dangerous computer. The classical score is quite good working with the visual but sometimes it seems the movie is lacking in other areas. There is minimal dialogue, it seems that there could be better editing aside from the famous jump cut near the beginning, and the plot jumps all over the place. What I take away from it is the progression of man over time. The fact that there is really no memorable character except the non-human computer is also interesting. Finally, this film was made before the moon landing so in a way it was ahead of its time. That being said it still was not my favorite film.	4.0	2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)	2013-06-01	1	0	1

I felt the film was lacking, and didn't see the bigger picture or appreciate its artistic quality. So, I put off seeing it again for years. Perhaps I had put it off because it seemed that too many critics went gaga over it, further leading to my skepticism. I'm glad I finally watched it again.This is an understatement, though. My second viewing put so many pieces of the film together, and it was quite a viewing experience. 2001 is beyond being an effective film; it is an amazing experience, an art form, with such a deep, thought-provoking perspective on existence, mankind, and the far-reaching beyond. It is an allegory of civilization, beginning with cave men and leading through years up till the present and future. There's something beautiful and majestic about the film. It really is an art form on a grandiose level; the score and scenery are amazing. 2001 explores the mysteries of the universe and the possibilities that mankind cannot comprehend.It's amazing to think this was made in 1968, the visuals, special effects are astounding and mind blowing. The music score, at points, give dimension and depth to the eeriness of space. There's a minimalist approach to film, yet it is so grandiose in its vision. Eerie music vocalizations enhance the vibe of being out there in the vastness of space. A beauty of this film is that there is so much to wrap your brain around. Some viewers complain that there is ""nothing going on"", not sensing that there is more present in the scope of a scene. The films last twenty minutes are stunning, scary, weird, extraordinary, a viewing mind trip.The beauty of the film is that you can interpret the ending, and other events, in various ways. The film works allegorically as much as literally. Arthur Clarke, who collaborated with Kubrick and was the author for the book which 2001 is based on, perhaps stated it best about the film's ambiguous ending and thoughtful experience of the film: ""If anyone understands it on the first viewing, we've failed in our intention.""One of the signs of a great film is that you leave the viewing experience thinking about what you saw and witnessed. 2001, perhaps more than any other film, makes you think about its meaning, about your world and the possibilities of beyond. Most remarkable is that 2001 becomes more of an experience by the time the credits roll.The sound and transfer are also fantastic, and the extras take you deeper into the viewing experience, and give some background into the film.2001: A Space Odyssey is a film experience like no other."	5.0	A viewing experience like no other	2011-09-20	3	3	0

If not, then I can guarantee you that this will captivate you beyond belief. I can find few movies from its time to compare to this masterpiece.Some have been posting that the quality of this version is not as good as they expected, or not as good as the original. Since I have never seen the original in VHS format, all I can say is that it's totally watch-able. I cannot however note the precision of the transfer of the veteran viewers.Stanley Kubrick is one of the most ingenious film makers of all time. The cinematography of the film is incredible in the way he uses the limited special effects that were available at the time, and especially sound. The sound is one thing that I find that Stanley Kubrick knew how to use best. The voices that he used in this movie for the monolith gave a tide of mysteriousness, curiosity, and the potential to freak someone out.He begins the movie displaying evolution and highlights particularly how apes gained intelligence by figuring out how to use bones as weapons. The movie then leaps forward to the space age, where a crew subsequently discovers a large, black, and mysterious object, known as the monolith, on the moon. The only thing the crew knew about this object is that it was buried on the moon 4 million years ago, deliberately.On a spaceship heading towards Jupiter, the flawless computer known as HAL 9000, makes its first mistake, and begins the worry the crew with its erratic behavior. Afterwards, the mysterious monolith returns, but this time not on the moon.2001 - A Space Odyssey is one of the best films of all time that I could not recommend more.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1TPFCXHCGKTY6	Frank L. Urbano	2001: A Space Odyssey is a true masterpiece of the science fiction genre.  When one thinks back to the time that it was created and filmed, it is amazing how much technology they were able to predict and portray.  Granted, we were clearly not anywhere close to the events of the movie as far as our ability to conquer space, but as a prediction in the late 60s, it was a good one.The movie has essentially 4 segments.  First is the 'Dawn of Man' whereby we witness of bunch of primates transform from a docile race into a race of creatures capable of killing.  The lack of dialogue in this section might seem strange, but the best way to describe this section is gripping.The next section tells the early part of the story of the monolith on the space station.  The characters are fascinating and the refinement with which this section was crafted is remarkable, again considering the time it was filmed.The next section deals with the mission to Jupiter and the breakdown of HAL 9000.  The only way to describe this section is eerie.  The performances of Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood (yes he was Gary Mitchell on Star Trek!) were great, but the voice over of HAL was sheer brilliance.  A combination of pathology and determination in the HAL's voice shows how one might envision an artificial intelligence acting some time in the future.  The only other comparable performance I can remember which comes even a slight bit close to HAL was the computer Alex in the Bionic Woman episode &#34;Doomsday is Tomorrow&#34;.  This section of 2001 is the most fascinating.The last section (again largely without dialogue) is Bowman's arrival at Jupiter and his interaction with the obelisk.  It is dramatic, sweeping, and grand in scope, and really leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions.Overall, like it or not, you cannot deny that this movie is one of the all-time classic science fiction movies.  Between the sweeping and wondrous music to the cinematography to the eerie character development, 2001 will not disappoint the person who likes science fiction but wants to see one of the classics.  It will also not disappoint the person who may not be a huge science fiction fan, but who likes sweeping dramas with grand music.This one is definitely a keeper!	5.0	A Sheer Masterpiece of Science Fiction History	2013-12-06	1	0	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2EIRCMHTO7CUI	Frank Messely	This is not just a movie.  This is a mind-altering experience.  I saw 2001 as a fifteen year old when it was re-released in the winter of '76 and I remember leaving the theater not quite sure what to think of it but convinced it would have a tremendous impact on my life.  And, indeed, as with the reappearing monolith, each time I watch the film (unfortunately, not in the spacious, magical dark of the theater - why don't they show it there at least once a year?), I discover yet another aspect of its deep content. Kubrick takes you on a journey that leaves you entranced; a slow, Zen-like, visually stunning trip through a timeless universe where man gets a glimpse of his true objective.  A hopeful message.  From 1976 on I dreamed of the year 2001, hoping that it would bring us all the wonderful things shown in what I now consider to be Kubrick's greatest achievement.  How sad we got 9/11 instead.  2001, A Space Odyssey is perhaps the most important movie ever made, a perfect combination of images, motion, sound (silence!), and music, with an awesome message.  Kubrick is a genius who creates personal works of art which grow more fascinating with each additional viewing.  He sure has secured his place among the greats:  Mozart, Stravinsky, Bart&oacute;k, Shakespeare, Joyce, Michelangelo, Gaudi, Dali, Picasso, Eisenstein, Welles...  What more can an artist wish for?  Five stars, definitely, although this film deserves as many as there are in the galaxy.  And as far as the BLU RAY version is concerned,  Herbert von Karajan once said about CD that it was the sunrise after the night (vinyl records). I repeat his words now with regard to DVD and BLU RAY. 2001 on BLU RAY is a real treat. Never since the theater have I enjoyed my favorite movie so much. And this is a plea: all Kubrick's masterpieces have been released on BLU RAY, except one, which I consider to be the most artistic in every sense of the word -- BARRY LYNDON. Please, release it on BLU RAY asap, and do it in the best possible way!!!!	5.0	A MONOLITH OF A MOVIE!	2010-06-09	7	6	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1NZ3OBRUF13FA	"Fred Burroughs ""Ladies and gentlemen, Fred Bu..."	"Even though Tarkovsky hated this movie (proving that even the greatest directors can have odd taste), I put it up with the works of Tarkovsky, Lynch, Fellini, Malick, etc. as films that have stretched the boundaries of film.  There's nothing wrong with conventional film.  City Lights is a conventional film and it's just as good as 2001.  But it was Kubrick's dream to make a movie that went beyond the conventional three-act play structure of most movies, that transcended everything we are used to about film.  His opinion was that he succeeded ""a little"" in 2001, which shows us just how far-flung his hopes were.  This is a totally unique movie.Many other films, especially some sci-fi films, have tried to imitate its slow, philosophical style but not really succeeded (or even attempted) replicating what was at the core of this movie.  If all art is about communication, then to stretch film to its limits means to find new ways of communicating with film, and finding new things to communicate.  Things beyond ""story,"" ""plots,"" ""characters,"" etc.I'm echoing Tarkovsky here again, that's because I'm a neo-Tarkovskyist (yes, I made that up).  Kubrick is almost satirizing the very idea of spoken dialogue and human drama as the things conventional movies spend their time on.  But at the same time humanity is at the heart of the film also.  This isn't just a movie about machines (what are machines without people to give them meaning?  just assemblages of matter), nor is it about individuals.I find a lot of critics focusing on the special effects, and many have accused Kubrick of indulging himself by allowing the model spaceships and ""time travel"" effects and so forth to feature so largely in the film.  The thing is, long and unbroken shots are typical of Kubrick.  In this film they just happen to feature spaceships instead of a NYC apartment hallway or a WW1 trench.  There's no doubting Kubrick wanted to ""wow"" people with the special effects, but more to the point he wanted to *convince* them with special effects.  Real space travel deserves a ""wow,"" and real humans in space was what he was trying to depict here.A lot of criticism also focuses on the pacing of this film.  There is no denying that it is a slow-paced movie.  This in itself is not a bad thing, and it becomes much less of an issue when watched the way it was supposed to be, on a very large screen projected from a pristine 70mm print, where the pacing actually seems faster because your eye wanders over the whole screen, taking in all of the details filling the frame.  Remember, it was never intended to be watched on a small television screen and those who have seen this film both on the big screen in 70mm and on tv will notice this.  Note:  you really should buy the Blu-Ray version of this movie and watch it on a full HD, big screen tv.  Depending on the size of your screen, you should probably be between six and eight feet away (there are calculators online to help you find your optimal seating distance for any home theater setup, and yes it does matter, not just for this movie but for all)."	5.0	My favorite movie, a turning point for cinema	2010-12-31	7	6	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2C7BOQVFH1HLE	Frederick Baptist	"There are few movies that have hooked me as much as this one.  It's such a classic that for some reason that I cannot pin down I keep returning to it at least once each year without fail.  I feel strangely drawn to it from the eerie opening overture music and pure black screen meant to signify the dawn of creation on earth to the first bars of Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" to the early humans seque-ing brilliantly to man in space, the trip to Jupiter and the super computer gone mad to the final mysterious ending signifying the wonders of the undiscovered and the awesomeness of it which would leave our jaws dropped just as this film does for me each time I watch it.If you are an intelligent film lover who looks beyond the quick thrill quick fix movie ala ""The Mummy"" and its countless sequels but look instead at good storytelling and character development as well as innovative, inspired directing so that the whole becomes a work of art to be admired and to stand the test of time, there are really not that many films in existence; this film happens to be one of those that stand the test of time to remain a work of film art to inspire and to entertain serious movie-goers for decades to come.Directors of note since the film's release such as Spielberg, Lucas among many others have already heralded the genius of this film and copied elements for their own work but you don't have to be a student of film to see just how brilliant this work of art is.  You don't simply watch this you experience it and I know each time I do, I take away something new from it and I always look forward to the next installment each year.Some have claimed that there is no clear story in this film but that is clearly false; there is one constant theme of the monolith and how it affected the various stages of human development suggesting it was the catalyst that got our civilisation going along the path it finally took.  There are a few different mini-stories such as the early man, sickness and discovery of the monolith on the moon, the technology gone mad HAL story on the way to Jupiter and the final quest for the still unknown mysteries of space and hence the future of man i.e. the Starchild story at the end.  A few mini-stories but all connected by the central theme of the monolith.  What is the monolith?  The religious among us may suggest that it is an analogy for God, for the atheists maybe some alien force that has an invisible hand in our species' growth and development; for George Lucas, it is The Force and I'm sure many others can substitute their own theories for this as well.Why are so many younger people so upset at this film?  Because in the old days of film, a good film like any good classic book or work of art doesn't tell you what to think but inspires and encourages you to find the meaning to make yourself better than you are by getting you to actually look into yourself and to find out how much potential you have to improve.  Films in the last couple of decades don't do this as they tell you what to think and simply give you what you want effectively dumbing down things so that you don't have the chance to improve yourself; the quick sugar fix that dies soon after the 2 or so hours are over.Some of you may say so what and still think ""The David Letterman Show"" is the epitome of great television; for you please give this and other films that are artforms such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" a miss because you just won't get it.  For those who see film as art and the great potential it has to educate and to encourage you to use your full God-given potential to think and grow, this film certainly ranks among the top-10 ever of greats of filmdom.This dvd is also a real treat for fans as it has been restored very well with the Dolby 5.1 Digital Surround although the picture quality is quite good there are still some imperfections that can be improved upon.  I can only imagine just how breathtaking the improved Blu-ray version must be.  The Special Features also include excellent footage of the late great Arthur C. Clarke giving a speech and Q&A; session at the opening of the film.  By the way, widescreen is the only way to view this film and do any justice to it.Not only is this the best Sci-Fi movie I've ever seen, it is also among the Top-10 works of film art ever made.  I cannot recommend this film highly enough and this dvd version is also of good quality although I'm sure the Blu-ray version would have removed the picture quality imperfections.Updated 29 May 2011:As Amazon will not allow me to review this separately the Blu-Ray version of this film classic is certainly worth the double-dip; both the picture and sound qualities of this version far exceed that of the dvd and while the picture quality hasn't been restored frame-by-frame which explains the less than perfect frames from time to time especially during the prehistory scenes overall the difference is like night and day when compared with the dvd.  The sound quality is vastly improved on the blu ray and the spoken dialogue comes across a lot clearer than on the dvd where sometimes it's barely audible.Overall a very good transfer to 1080p and even the bonus features documentaries are a lot better than those on the dvd version.Recommended!"	5.0	The First Truly Great Science Fiction Movie!

This movie is just as I remembered it, some stylish scenes and futuristic depictions of AI/computer technologies etc... but it's so damn pretentious and the use of classical music which I love is in such bad taste almost being a joke in the lighter aspects of the film. The early scenes are meant to inspire wonder, but when juxtaposed against the stark monolith themes it comes off like an insulting joke. The star of the movie is Hal and that's about it, ""open the pod bay doors"" that's the highlight of the film, for real. But even that AI meltdown scene is so drawn out that I kept yawning, in fact about 20 times at least I found myself checking the time remaining and YAWNING uncontrollably...""what? and HOUR LEFT?"" that's not good movie making. Then to end with the obelisk space embryo scene, I just have to laugh again in disgust at how this film is so overrated and highly regarded.I'd suggest, buying some ancient Egyptian art books, watching Planet Of The Apes and thumbing through some old early sic-fi conceptual art from the 50's on while listening to the classical music of your choice like Scriabin, Liszt or Chopin over suffering through this garbage.

If you've seen it before then this will give you another great reason to watch it again like never before. If you haven't seen it before it may be a little slow because back when the film was made they did not use a lot of ambient music and such to fill that uncomfortable scilence you sometimes get on the older movies. There seem to be more of those then I can remember on this film but it's still one of the greatest and inspired a lot of great now classics and newer films as well.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A162CHKPA7CSXN	Gabriel Girard	A masterpiece of cinema or how to transcend a form of art.  Movies have a long history of being about image and music before being about talking. 2001 might just be cinema in its purest form. A work of visual metaphors and  full of symbolism it is the epic poem of all the movies I've ever seen.  Yes it is slow but this slownees has a purpose, first of all the movie is about the evolution of mankind which is, after all, a long history. Second of all it takes place in REAL time-space where the only thing you hear is your own breathing and where you move as in slow-motion.Let's not forget that there is also actual supense in the famous HAL segment. I will not discuss the meaning of it here as I believe each movie-watcher must make his/her own meaning. It is also a technical msterpiece, this was made 9 years before the first Star Wars, Kubrick did a lot of the final sequence himself by modifying things on the celluloid itself!!!

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2P541A2E9K5EG	Gabriel Velez	"So far, we are mostly reading reviews about a film made by Kubrick.Are we forgetting the writer of the saga, the true genius behind the classic?Arthur C. Clarke not only wrote the story, but many other great science fiction stories, many of which tended to forge the future of technology and science.Kubrick, in my opinion, merely knew a good story when he read one.Yet, one must give proper kudos where it is deserved. No doubt being helped to appreciate the vision by Clarke himself, Kubrick did a more than excellent job with the screenplay and special effects, almost rivaling today's CGI, with the exception of the light speed visions and the end, which even today at 45 years old, seems a bit confused, and fizzles out the whole premise of the story of evolution and technological progress. What the FX was that? ;-)Basically, it leaves me wondering, ""What's with the fetus?""Yet, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a film which I class as being among the best of the best of sci-fi cinema. It is on the same level as ""Metroopolis"", ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", ""Forbidden Planet"", and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", all of which are in my collection.Anyone who wants to compare it with ""Star Wars"" is merely comparing Granny Smith apples with Red Delicious apples. Same genre, and that is all they share.""2001"" is an intellectual work of art. ""Star Wars"" is for kids.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3D561U68TE3MN	Gary Camp	"A reaction to William Sommerwerck's thoughtful review, and additional comments:I, too, am a geezer.  I'm glad the Blu-ray is a better rendition of 2001 than the DVD. The potential of a fine grain emulsion 65 mm negative or 70 mm print in good condition should be greater than that of Blue-ray, so I always hope for a gorgeous disk from 70 mm.  Yes, as you say, ""60 inches is not enough.""  I have found that a very slightly curved Home Theater screen 12 feet wide, seen at about 12 feet away from the center of the screen  (~~ 55 degree viewing angle) can fairly convincingly simulate the image size seen from the 18th row in my favorite 70 mm theater.  Most Blu-ray disks and home displays won't hold up; one can always move back.I had a rather different experience than you in the theater.  The two 70 mm prints I saw (on the West coast) were more like your description of the Blu-ray version, except that we could absolutely read the zero-gravity toilet instructions -- every word was sharp.  True, the image was a bit softer than some 70 mm films like Ben-Hur, but  the detail was there, just not as etched looking.  Some images were very detailed, e.g., The Dawn of Man sequence, and the docking sequence with the uncompleted space station was ""reach out and touch it,"" with an incredible sense of depth -- almost like 3D -- between the various structural components of the space station.  There was no halation or flare-like scattered light, except in a very few shots where I'm pretty sure it was intended.  The overall experience was the most immersive and near-hypnotic of my moviegoing lifetime (no drugs were involved), especially in one of the 70 mm theaters with a screen 85 feet across the chord of the arc, where, on repeated viewings, we tried out the front row.  The image was extraordinarily detailed, pretty sharp, and with amazingly fine grain, even as close as that.The differences between the image quality in your two theaters and mine leads me to wonder:1) Could the lower image quality you report be partly responsible for the initial reaction of the East coast critics, which was much more negative than that of those on the West coast?  True one of the NY critics who didn't like it called it a ""masterwork"" on second viewing (this is in Agel), but I can see how a scattered light image could be off-putting enough to keep someone from getting into the film.2) Your mention of scattered light makes me suspicious.  The two theaters I saw it in had their Cinerama screens installed with point source 70 mm projection in mind, for films like Grand Prix and The Hallelujah Trail -- the old three panel Cinerama was dead by then.  If the theaters you saw it in had been set up for three panel Cinerama, I wonder if the vertical slats of the Cinerama screen, or even the depth of the curve, were still adjusted for three panel, in which two of the three projectors would have been shooting light from a completely different angle than would a centered 70 mm projector.  Would this have caused the light scattering and blur you saw?I'm happy that the aspect ratio is the original 70 mm shape of 2.2:1, according to Amazon ... I vastly preferred that shape to the 2.35:1 (or 2.39:1) of 35 mm widescreen.  2.2:1 allowed the audience to lose awareness of the screen borders -- unlike with more extreme aspect ratios that cause the eye to crash into the top of the image when looking up.Also, for those reviewers who think otherwise, Arthur C. Clarke, in his book The Lost Worlds of 2001, stated that the movie 2001 was NOT based on his book 2001, but that the book and the screenplay were written simultaneously, ""with feedback in both directions.""  He confirmed this in his visit to San Francisco for a conference on the future at the Exploratorium in 1971.  At that meeting he said that Kubrick gave him some books by Joseph Campbell, saying, ""Here, read these,"" and then the two of them wrote the screenplay together."	5.0	A reaction to William Sommerwerck's thoughtful review, and additional comments	2009-05-21	5	5	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV	"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"""	The Good News: although small screens dim its power and although the special effects seem increasingly dated, 2001 remains just as intriguing as it was when first released.  It is still a movie that requires considerable thought, still a movie over which viewers argue--and argue passionately.  And that in and of itself is an astonishing accomplishment.The great debate re 2001 centers upon the &quot;meaning&quot; of the film.  Some will tell you, including some of its fans, that 2001 has no &quot;meaning&quot; per se; it is about itself and nothing more.  Others will argue that it concerns contact with an alien life form that never actually appears in the film.  Still others feel that the film is about man's relationship to mankind in general, technology, and God.  The interpretations are endless, and therein we see the true measure of the film as an artistic creation: not only does it support the imposition of numerous interpretations, it also transcends the limits of its interpreters and forces them to debate what they think the film is about.The Bad News: 2001 is a long film that often seems much longer than it actually is.  This is partly due to the nature of Kubric's vision, which shows man as considerably less interesting than his machinery and surroundings; it is also partly due to some self-indulgence on the part of the director, who has a career-long tendency to excessively linger.  The first portion of the film (the infamous &quot;ape&quot; sequence) was considered pretty silly even when the film was first released, and time has not improved upon it.  The last portion of the film, although visually stunning, is extremely weak in terms of actual content.These failings might be overlooked but for one thing.  2001 was designed to be seen on an extremely large screen, and since two-story tall movie screens are extremely rare these days, you are very unlikely to ever have that opportunity.  When scaled down to a current &quot;standard size&quot; screen, or worse still to the dimensions of your television set, 2001 loses most of its visual impact, and without the visual impact the film's weaknesses seem much more important than its strengths.  Simple as that, and no way around it.Big screen or small screen, not every one likes 2001.  (My own feelings are mixed.) If you have never seen the film, I strongly recommend that you rent the film instead of buying it outright.  Then, if you are one of those who dislike it, you are only out the cost of a rental and a few hours of your time.  On the other hand, if you are one who passionately admires it--and there are many--you will then have the pleasure of purchasing your own copy to enjoy again in the future.	3.0	Good News and Bad News About  A Very Famous Film	2001-12-24	6	4	2

Mind you, I had already tried once back in 1983, for school, but I never got past the first half.Now, I'm pretty sure that for its time, it was an amazing movie, assuming you were on acid, that is. If you're not, and you suffered through it like me and my wife did, then you might have a different opinion.Pros: It has pretty good special effects when you consider it was made in the late 60s.Cons:* Really poor acting. The lines were poorly delivered and would give the Star Wars movies a good run for their money.* A paper thin plot. It could have been summarized down to an hour.* God awful overly long sequences that seemed to have no point to it. For instance, there are the outside shots of the spacecraft that pan very slowly around it. We put the DVD on double speed and we honestly could not tell the difference.Apparently there used to be leaflets handed out to the druggies that told them the best time to take their LSD.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A342AZPTC0QE57	Gaz	Those who have seen 2001 are firmly divided into two categories: those who vaguely understand it, or appreciate it for it's sophistication and patient beauty, thus those who like it; and those who are confounded by it, don't have the patience for it's painfully slow plot development and fail to get to grips with the sudden dash of events at the end. I am, sadly, in the second category.The first thing people are likely to hate is the sheer lack of incident. The film is as follows: Some prehistoric apes discover a large black thing, and upon touching it become rather disagreeable; four million years later, some astronouts find the same thing on the moon, and upon touching it become rather gone; two guys go on a mission to find out what happened; their super-computer HAL goes insane, kills one of them, the other guy turns HAL off, and promptly goes to some distant part of the universe, ages in minutes, becomes a huge cosmic baby and all is over, shortly after seeing the black thing that apparently has something to do with everything. Er... what?Of course these simple events take an age to happen, with nice-looking very musical space scenes, and Kubrick's trademark wide shots... but visuals and grand classical score aside, what is there to like? HAL is fantastic, a blank yet irresistable voice and a creepy, almost omnipresent eye-like red light. His final moments, drearily singing &quot;daisy&quot; are fascinating to watch.But the film truly feels as though four million years has passed, and no attempt is made to explain anything, as neither the characters (or, therefore, us) finds anything out. How does Dave get where he ends up? Why does he age? Who/what is the cosmic baby, why is it there?It all has too great a feel of randomness claiming to be brilliant because no-one can understand it. It feels like a semi-developed idea, a severely unfinished ending and an over-dependance on music to keep things in any way interesting. Once HAL's out of the picture, it all loses what little interest it had.Basically, I think whoever claims to adore 2001 does so because all the critics have done, and because the inexplicable plot must therefore be too ingenius to work out - hence brilliant. This is, however, not necessarily the case.It's an odd film then, that feels like it needs to be heavily revised and re-done, and people need to form their own opinions rather than trusting the big director behind it and the legions of fans. Dawn of sci-fi? I think not.	2.0	Space Absurdity	2002-10-28	32	12	20

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AGMI06Z7JDCL6	GeneH	"Almost anything that Stanley Kubrick touched was magical.  In ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" Kubrick tried to consider a future and deliver a moral lesson on the wages of deception.  At the same time he eliminated the fantasy and mental garbage which infested so much Science Fiction. There is no ""Force"", no magic talismans... just technology, techniques and tact.One regrets that the future did not turn out per Mr. Kubrick's vision.  In a sense, his movie evokes a sense of irony and pathos - the future wasn't so glamorous or focused on growth and space flight as it would have seemed thirty five years ago.  In a profound sense, though not the intention of either Mr. Clarke or Mr. Kubrick, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a vision... and an accusation and an admission of failure.A vision of what might have been, and still could be, if enough people judge it important enough to do.

The film's long, drawn out scenes are complimented by sounds as if the two are one. For instance (spoiler), an astronaut is hurdling into space, doomed to the black beyond, and all you will hear... is silence. It's moments such as this that truly evoke emotions ranging from fear to smiling bliss.The film's meaning is left for the audience to interpret. It it isn't spoon-fed to you. Scenes are long, drawn out, and filled with symbols that fit together like a million puzzle pieces. They're almost meant to be studied like one would study a painting.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2FDW0X0TAEYYF	George Sarant	I saw this movie when it first came out in 1968. It was a Cinerama production at the Cinerama theater on Broadway in New York. That was a process that involved three screens to create a widely immersive experience. It is a process that didn't last, and unfortunately I've seen some film transfers where the borders between the screens were clearly visible.  That is not the case with 2001 and the reproduction is from a 70MM print, which fortunately were made to reach a wider audience. I cannot describe the awestruck feeling I had upon first viewing this film. I grew up a science fiction fan but most prior films tended to be disappointing in terms of effects. This was the first film to provide plausible and authentic-looking effects. I've bought every iteration of this film from videotape to laserdisc, and this blu-ray transfer is a pure joy to watch. It has been faithfully reproduced and is a first-rate blu-ray transfer. It was the genius of Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke that made all of this possible. Some people today may find the ballet of the spaceship and station boring, but I can never get enough of it. My guess is that Kubrick got the idea to use classical music from visits to the planetarium, where it used to be heard. It translates beautifully the majesty of space.What is more remarkable is how well the film still holds up after more than forty years. It was a plausible view of 2001 from the standpoint of 1968, and because we have made disappointingly insufficient progress in space, it is still forward looking. I was one of those who booked a seat on the now-defunct Pan Am spaceship of the future and I truly regret that such things will not happen i my lifetime. But the might have. The sequel is a real clunker so don't bother with it. Given the low price Amazon is offering this great epic at, buying it is an easy choice.	5.0	A landmark classic that still holds up.	2009-12-19	4	4	0

Especially given the times in which it was written, Astronauts were of a different sort in the 1960's and not the autocratic astronauts seen in Poole and Bowman.  Of course manybe Clarke was not all that wrong.  Sometimes predictions wind up being right.As brillaint as 2001 is it is not a perfect movie by far.  It is slow and padded.  I don't doubt this was deliberate.  What really gets me is the last drug inducing / inspired ending.  I don't do drugs, nor was I born when the movie came into the world (1969 fyi).  2001 lets us ponder the nature of the universe but without any context or ideas within the movie.  Those answers were in the equally good, yet different 2010.  Which makes 2001 a bad mystery.  It's like a murder mystery with only the murder.  I think it could have been just as powerful of a movie without the doped up (and sort of dopey) ending.Is it worth seeing?  Yes.  Is it a sacred cow?

If I hadn't read the first two books a few days after watching it I still probably wouldn't understand the ending.It is a very slow-paced film, but it still manages to hold your attention the entire-way through.  Probably partly because of the wonderful soundtrack, partly because of the excellent cinematography and partly because the suspense and horror that unfolds during the final half, as HAL 9000 shows his true self.Overall, it's a extremely slow-moving movie, with little dialogue, but still somehow exciting.  Sure action-packed shows like Star Wars and The Matrix are great, but 2001: A Space Odyssey proves that you can have little action or story and still have a fantastic science fiction movie.  It's more of an experience than anything, one that can be watched multiple times without growing tired of it.

The colors and the light of some shots are amazing. And this blu-ray has legends in Portuguese!!!

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2MNB9PF4QMK9P	"givbatam3 ""givbatam3"""	"I am aware that many people were puzzled by the message of this film, and I myself wondered about it until I read about the 19th century German philosopoher Friedrich Nietzsche who was highly regarded as a thinker 100 years ago but who was discredited by the Nazis adopting him as some sort of proto-Nazi, which he wasn't...he despised the German people and admired the Jews.It turns out that Kubrick and Clark put a lot of Nietzsche's bizarre philosophy in their film. It should be remembered that Nietzsche was insane the last 10 years of his life.The first clue comes when we see hear the solemn music of ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" when the monolith appears. This music, by Richard Strauss, is based on Nietzche's infamous ""Superman"" theory.  Nietzsche believed that there were individuals (not races or nations, and certainly not the Germans) who were so talented that they could transcend all contemporary morality and human culture and become ""great"".  Note that this is what happens when the apes come in contact with the monolith. The one who figures out how to make weapons from the jawbone of a boar is the first ""Superman"". We then fastforward to the discovery of the monolith on the moon. Heywood Floyd and the others touch it and this then gives them new powers as the new ""Superman"", moving man into a higher plane, which leads them to launching the Discovery mission with Frank and Dave. At the end, when Dave sees himself as an old man, we see the monolith again, showing how man moving into space has become yet a higher ""superman"".Regarding Dave seeing himself as a old man dying: This is also Nietszche. Nietzsche also believed in something called ""The Eternal Recurrence"", which  means people keep coming back and living their lives over and over, which is what Dave is experiencing.Now comes the big surprise....Nietzsche got this idea while hiking in Switzerland and viewing a big cliff....this is where the idea of the monolith came from!Regarding the film itself, we can see that Kubrick had no use for people. We see few people in the film, there is almost no dialogue except for the discussion about what sandwiches are available on the shuttle craft that is transporting everyone from Clavius base (note the fellow keeps repeating ""ham, ham, ham"" while searching for the sandwiches as an allusion to the apes learning earlier to eat pork and eventually to make war), Heywood Floyd is practically alone on the Moon shuttle.  On the Discovery , the astronauts in suspended animation look like they are in coffins, which is what they end up becoming.We are never told why HAL goes crazy other than to say that he notices that something is ""odd"" about the mission.  Astronaut Frank Poole is completely emotionless when he hears the birthday greetings from his parents. The sets of almost all locations are sterile and lifeless, generally without color.  A generally boring, anti-human film, whose only saving grace are the music and the excellent special effects which still look modern.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3T1LD0C65QCWK	Gordon M. Wagner	Clean picture, vivid colors. 2001 is an interesting movie. I'm not sure it's even science fiction. Certainly not a 1950s type of space opera or monster movie. The wordless scenes with the apes is classic, and the real sci fi meat of the excursion begins on a shuttle from Earth to a double-wheel space station shown under construction. There's a scene with some Russian astronauts or business people which bored the pants off me when I was a kid, but which I think is brilliant now that I'm an adult and realize what was being said in the exchange. Then onto another shuttle to the moon. The use of the then-thriving Pan Am airlines as a commercial carrier for Earth-to-the-Moon travel was brilliant, having their logo on the spaceships. The last bit of glorious sci fi hardware is when the shuttle lands on the moon in an underground base. Awesome stuff.Then off to another meeting, which I could not comprehend as a kid, but which, again, makes all too much sense to me as an adult -- the cover story promoted by the US after they find an obleisk buried on the Moon. From there on we meet the HAL 9000 unit and it's more of  a suspense story, with their computer going insane and trying to kill the astronauts. Or perhaps acting to keep humans from meeting whatever the scenes on Jupiter were supposed to mean.Was the final third of the movie Kubrick's idea of what an LSD experience was like? Keir Dullea is excellent throughout. The best part of the movie, really. Inspired casting.Overall? I've been collecting sci fi movies for 20+ years now, and only last week got around to buying a copy of 2001. So maybe it's not great science fiction, but it does have some awesome sci fi hardware, and shown not as speculation, but as if it were actually functioning, which was revolutionary for sci fi up until 2001. Compare and contrast 2001 with Dark Star from 1974 or 1975. And then Aliens, and the Space Marines (&#34;I hate this job.&#34;).You've gotta see this, if only because it's a great movie.

The only reason this movie would have a rating any lower than 4 stars is because &quot;stupid&quot; people, for lack of a better word, don't realize what Kubrik did with this, and the whole story line.  This film was created in the 70's, where there weren't any real science fiction movies that had descent effects, and there sure as hell weren't any movies out with a plot this deep.  People who didn't understand/like it need to understandhow much of a master piece it was at its time; there where no star wars when it came out or starship troopers.  It paved the way for much of science fiction to come.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2BM6Z76B2XO1L	Greg	"Back in the early eighties, I attended a lecture given by a producer from the National Film Board of Canada. He screened an early 1960's 30 minute film called ""The Planets"", in black and white, with really beatiful images of space. (There were some striking images of comet trails, as I recall, that he told us had been done simply by pouring water down a plate of glass painted with ink; backlit. It looked great). The film was purchased and used by NASA as part of training for their staff, in preparation for the space program.Anyhow, he went on to tell us a story of how Arthur C. Clark called up Stanley Kubrick and said that there was a film from the NFB that he thought Stanley should see. They viewed the film together, Stanley was very impressed, and they agreed that the quality of these visuals had the potential to be made into a major futuristic work. Arthur C. Clarke would write the story, and Stanley Kubrick hired the team of artists who made The Planets to work on 2001.An intereting footnote: According to the speaker, Stanley Kubrick also hired the narrator from The Planets as the voice of HAL. (Speaking of HAL, try moving the three letters H-A-L forward one in the alphabet and see what that spells!)Thanks for your time and kind attention, think I need to watch this one again soon! (Saw it in the theatre when it first came out, seven years old at the time. Knew I was seeing a quantum leap in visual effects, although of course I would not have been able to articulate it in that way). I have also read that the significance of the planetary alignment opening sequence is that once every thousand years, the planets in our solar system form a perfect alignment, signalling the dawn of a new millenium, and that this alignment occurred in 2001."	5.0	Interesting footnote re: 2001	2013-08-26	2	2	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3DXVAI08P00HD	Greg	2001 A Space Odyssey is one of those rare movies of any genre which don't seem to lose their interest even when they show their age.  Like Fritz Lang's Metropolis, or Steven Speilberg's 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and Star Wars, 2001 is a true classic which set the standard for many later SF films.The film is very rich in terms of story, imagery, character and special effects.  While some of the effects are obviously dated in the light of today's CGI, some remain remarkably convincing even to the present viewer, such as the scenes of flying space hotels and shuttles, the scenes of the Moon, and the scenes on board The Discovery and around Jupiter.The film is based on a series of stories by the great SF writer Arthur C Clarke, including his story 'The Sentinel', which is about the discovery of an alien artefact by a scientific expedition to the Moon, and another story about an alien being who is a member of a race whose mission it is to breed intelligent life across the galaxy by 'artificial' selection.  Clarke combines and explains some of the themes in the movie in his novelisation of the movie, which should be read before or after viewing 2001, otherwise much of it won't make sense.The story is basically about the discovery of an enigmatic object called simply 'The Monolith' on the Moon in 1999 by a party of astronauts. When it is discovered, the monolith sends a powerful radio signal into space.  This puts into motion a top-secret mission to Jupiter (Saturn in Clarke's novel) by a team of scientists and astronauts, led by Dave Bowman, on board a ship piloted and maintained by an intelligent computer named HAL-9000, which has the same cognitive capacity as a human mind.Things seem to go fairly smoothly for the mission until HAL-9000 seems to go 'crazy' and shuts down the life support for all the crew members, and ejects another astronaut into space, before Bowman takes action and shuts down HAL and goes out to meet the monolith on his own.  Bowman then undergoes a truely bizarre encounter through the 'stargate' which transfers him to another place, and in the process Bowman is transfigured to an entirely new order of being, a new type of humanity ready to face the stars.The imagery of 2001 is highly utopian (despite the tragic outcome of human and artificial intelligence) and centers around the increase of human intelligence and scientific and technological progress, guided ultimately by the alien beings who programmed the monoliths.  While confusing at times, the theme is similar to many of Clarke's novels and stories, which deal with how mankind must come to terms with its cosmic destiny in the face of an infinite universe.  In 2001, the solution is that humankind is, like the savage humanoids at the start of the film, 'evolved' into a new order of creature whose true destiny lies in the stars.The cosmic scope of the film is backed up by the themes, images, and symbolism, from the glittering, bright high technology of spaceships to images of planets and moons.  Kubrick achieved this with true mastery over the imagery and tropes of science fiction, rather than simply trying to give the biggest bang for your buck.  The film is also highly accurate on many points of physics, including the fact sound can't travel in space.To many the film might be arcane and boring, and it probably is to many, including a younger audience.  But with some patience, the beauty of the film and its themes becomes apparent, and it makes concrete some of the interesting themes of hard SF, which remain common in great hard SF writers today such as Stephen Baxter.	5.0	Great SF Classic	2007-03-20	6	5	1

Every time I rented it afterwards, it became deeper, more mystic, intriguing, and stranger.  There's really no explanation to the film or its ending, which is one of the greatest endings in the history of cinema, one that will be talked about forever, and no one will ever truly figure it out.  And who really wants to figure it out?  I love the wonderful confusion and ambiguity that I felt (and still feel).I saw this a few years ago in a special restored, 70mm print at the Music Box Theatre in Chicago (a wonderful vintage theater).  The theater was filled to capacity, including many teenagers.  My prejudice surfaced a bit, and I was worried the teens might say something snarky.  Nope.  Not one person in the theater said anything.  No one left.  They were all completely mesmerized by this film, still, even in this era ""no attention spans"" (the fact that the audience sat and watched with such intensity makes me question the attention span comment that has permeated discourse for the last 10 years or so).  Why is this?  Why does this film, even after nearly 40 years, still enthrall all those who come across it?  And why does it still encaptures us who have seen it nearly 20 times or so, and who could see another 20 times?  It's extremely well made; it's a true artistic work; Kubrick's ambition pushed his crew and actors to do things.  I can't say.  All I can say is that its power has grown over time.I would like to mention a man who is partially responsible for this masterpiece, the late Robert O'Brien, the head of MGM at the time.  He greenlighted this project in 1965, and stuck with Kubrick throughout its making, despite the fact that the original budget jumped from 6.5 million to 10.5 million.  Kubrick started shooting in December 1965, and didn't finish the picture until April 1968.  O'Brien got flack for his original decision, and for continuing to stick with Kubrick, but stick with him he did, and if it wasn't for his faith in the master Kubrick, we may have never seen this film.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2I87OY16UP61R	G. Shkodra	"Stanley Kubrick didn't like much to talk about this movie because, as he put it, ""this is an effort to communicate with the subconscient and with sensations rather than with the intellect"". In fact 2001 is about the need mankind has to transcend its limited thinking and move to greater dimensions, it's a transcendental experience, and by that I mean something that can not be expressed by words: what is our significance in the universe, how intelligent are we, how old or how young is our childish civilization, what is our role and our destiny in the universe and what is the extraterrestrian intelligence?All the question raised by 2001 come naturally as we pass from the rational to the transcendental. The first is fundamental: the ape raising the bone like a weapon, later transforming into a giant spaceship. That bone is a weapon as one of the apes had just used it to kill an enemy. In that transformation, Kubrick recaps the entire human history and - mind you - the history of mankind is synthetized in a gesture of death, as a dead thing, the bone, serves as a lethal arm. The dawn of man ends right at the moment when the alien signal reaches him. Only then man reaches the adult phase...the scientists gather around the monolith they have found on the moon exactly the way the apes did millions of years before them...One of the best scenes of the movie is the one just before and during HAL's disconnection; HAL, the computer - to many viewers one of the few human figures of the movie - is thought of making a mistake about a malfunctionning object aboard the ship and the astronauts secretly decide to disconnect him, but he discovers it. HAL's disconnection is one of the few moving sequences in Kubrick movies ( together with little Bryan's death in ""Barry Lyndon"" ). Much has been said and written about what it means: how we, as human beings, should not rely too much on technology, how the conflict between man and machines is inevitable, how men feel intimidated by the machines abilities and intelligence and how they seem useless and superfluous compared to the computers...I don't know...it seems that Kubrick movies are destined to raise many questions and finding the right answers to them is never easy, but I gues it means that once we're on the brink of the unknown, there where the unknown mysterious presences that put the monolith on the moon are waiting for us, the word - the reason - must give up its place to something else: words can not describe the undescribable, as Bowman travels through a wormhole towards...what?..I don't have the pretention to say I know it, as many people do, but let's say towards another dimension, towards the unexplored and the unimaginable.This movie set the standarts for the decades to come: I just can't believe it was shot in 1968 - it's so contemporaneous, so intelligent, contemplative and self-discovering, a two and a half hours movie with only forty minutes of dialogue. Actually I've never seen a movie where silence is much more meaningful than any dialogues. The ape raising the bone, HAL's eye, the giant space wheel spinning round, the black monolith, the star-child looking enigmatically towards the earth, and all these scenes blending in with some fantastically psychedelic sounds and colors, not to talk about the ""Blue Danube"" and ""Also sprach Zarathustra"".Bottom line, one of the best and enigmatic movies of all time."	5.0	Universe is a cold and frightening place indeed!	2001-12-04	1	1	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A387XCVR145N9J	G. Taylor	"I would consider myself a moderate Science Fiction fan. I am definetly not to the ""Have a tatoo of Leonard Nemoy on my butt"" level but may one day reach the ""Own over 10 space ship replica models"" level.I had heard about 2001 for years. I had heard mostly bad things from friends who just like stupidly entertaining comedy movies. (I love Bio-Dome too, but best movie ever? Come on!) I knew this would likely be a movie that I enjoyed, so I decided to splurge the $10 on the Kubrik Collection DVD a few months back. I purchased this along with some other ""classic"" movies (including Clockwork Orange) and slowly worked my way through all of them over the next few weeks.When I first watched 2001 I was tired, bored, and generally confused. I wasn't really that into it, short of laughing nonstop during the monkey scene in the beginning. I finished it, turned off my DVD player, and went to sleep confused.The next day was spent reading interpretations of the ending and wishing I was a Space Baby. Time went on and it collected dust on the shelf.As I said above, I bought another one of Kubrik's films, Clockwork Orange, at the same time. Similarly to 2001, I watched it, went to bed confused, read about it online, and forgot about it. As months went by, I found myself wondering more about Clockwork Orange and eventually was convinced to rewatch it. To my pleasure, I thoroughly enjoyed Clockwork Orange the second time throguh.Yesterday I found myself with three free hours and have had 2001 in the back of my mind for months. Like Clockwork Orange, I decided to give it another go. Low and behold my jaw stayed dropped during roughly 2/3 of the movie. The stunning visuals, the interwoven music, and the minimalistic dialogue came through more clearly upon watching the movie the second time through.One of the scenes I did not remember that absolutely blew me away was when the Aries 1B ship (that takes the Doctor from Earth's gravitational pull to the Moon Base) is landing on the moon base. The large port doors slowly open, showing the Aries 1B approaching from above. The craft lands smoothly and my jaw was on the floor. It completely took my breath away. However, like much of the movie, it was followed by a slow 2 minute scene depicting the circular ship being lowered into the landing bay. This is one example of the scene going on for too long.Therefore, this is a movie for a certain type of person in a certain type of mood. Based on my viewing of 2001 last night, I give this movie a 5. Based on forcing myself to watch it when I didn't really want to the first time I would give the movie a 2. Therefore I will score this movie a 5 with the assumption that I will never watch it when not in the proper mood.Long, slow, & dull at times? Yes.Breathtaking, trippy, and some of the finest cinemetography ever? Yes.5/5"	5.0	Trippy? Slow? Breathtaking? Boring? Amazing? Yes...	2008-02-19	1	1	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AP62B8RM9UTVC	Gunnar L. Ericsson	&quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, is one of those films that everyone must see.  There is no other film that even compares to it's greatness and originality.  It's a Science fiction film that is unlike any other film of  it's kind.  A film that raises many questions, and one that lets you answer  the questions for yourself.  &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; is the most  visually stunning film ever made, one that surpasses even the high tech  modern day films from directors such as Steven Spielberg and James Cameron.  Watching &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; for me, is more than a movie  experience...it's like a great dream you never want to awaken from.  This  is more than a film...this is a work of art.  I've seen &quot;2001: A Space  Odyssey&quot; more than 200 times now, and I recommend that everyone who  hasn't seen it, that they see it...but keep in mind to only view it in the  Widescreen format.  Viewing the film in Pan and Scan is awful, and it  doesn't have the same effect as the widescreen.  If you love this film as  much as I do, you will be happy to know that there is a planned re release  for the film on midnight, December 31, 2000.	5.0	The greatest film ever made!	1999-12-19	12	10	2

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AV3JZAYAP7GHC	halda	Kubrick's anti-romance about space exploration and the role of humanity in a shrinking universe is perhaps one of the greatest films ever made.Special effects that, 35 years later, still stand out as ground-breaking remind us that man is unfit for space travel, unless he puts his  survival in the hands of his own creation -- technology and machines.Space is the cold, lonely void, and man's fragile self can only explore it by the grace of an unknown race of intelligent beings who guide us. But guide us to what? Servitude like animals in a zoo or a higher plane of evolution? Kubrick leaves a lot of unanswered questions, but the film itself is feast enough for the  eyes.Kubrick postulates that there may be something &quot;out there&quot;, but we may not want to know how to find it.	5.0	It's very cold in space	2003-06-05	4	3	1

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A38GVGQOALNF1Y	harvestbase	Stanley Kubrick's &quot;2001- A Space Odyssey&quot; still stands today as a classic above all others. This film brings author Arthur C. Clarke's unique view of the evolution of man.Our movie begins with a brilliant sunrise and Richard Strauss' &quot;Also Sparch Zarathustra.&quot; We are then taken to a desert and words that read, &quot;The Dawn of Man.&quot; From there, we see apes fighting over land and water. The apes awaken one day to see a black monolith sitting in their sleeping spaces. The apes are fightened as horrific music arouses in the background. The apes battle more, now armed with animal bones as weapons.The next segment is not titled, but takes us to the future. We are now in the year 2001, and see that space technology has swept the solar system. Dr. Heywood R. Floyd (Sylvester) is giving a speech about a new epidemic, and then visits the moon. He was given information that a black monolith was found under the surface, and that it was deliberately buried...When Floyd and other explorers go to inspect it, they are suddenly surrounded by a very high pitched siren. The scene ends and brings us to the Jupiter Mission.We find Dave Bowman (Dullea) and Frank Poole inside their spacecraft with their robot companion, HAL 9000. HAL tells the two men that something outside the ship is going to break down. After inspections, the men find there is nothing wrong with the device, and discuss shutting down HAL. HAL becomes angry, and eliminates Frank. Dave battles with HAL before successfully pulling the plug. A pre-recorded message appears, informing Dave that a black monolith was discovered on the moon, and that its purpose was unknown. The only thing known about this monolith is that it generated a high beam ray towards Jupiter.The third segment, Jupiter and the Infinite Beyond. Dave is cast through time and space, and lands in a strange room, where he finds himself rapidly aging. He lies in bed, old and crippled. Dave lifts his arm and points at something at the end of his bed, the black monolith. Dave is turned into a Star Child, and this brilliant film ends with the superhuman Star Child looking on towards Earth as &quot;Also Sparch Zarathustra&quot; is heard for its final time.This film, not only a masterpiece in every possible way, is a movie that stretches your beliefs, your thoughts, in a way, your mind. Kubrick and Clarke created and gave something to us that mankind can never forget.	5.0	Also Sprach Zarathustra	2003-07-05	5	3	2

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A25F8G0LJGLLQW	Hector Ferral	This is my favorite film of all times; Stanley Kubrick at his very best!! Filmed in 1968, it is a metaphoric history of mankind. Starting with the origin of mankind, it describes human's deepest fears and reactions, the development of weapons as the start of civilization as we know it today and then travels to the future and ends with the rebirth of man;The futuristic concepts of the film are eerie for the time it was produced. Kubrick and Clarke handle several concepts that back in 1968 were probably too far advanced such as: freezing bodies to decrease metabolism and save energy for outer space travel,  &#34;face-time &#34; phone conversations in outer space, &#34;space-labs&#34; and computer controlled space travel; These concepts were probably considered unreachable back in 1968 .The idea of computers controlling our actions and life is not far from our present situation. The scene where HAL is disconnected is probably one of the top 10 and in my opinion, most dramatic scenes in film of all times. The quality of the special effects is stunning.The music score is delightful and applied with impressive accuracy and it includes excerpts from music by Johann Struss (the waltzes), Richard Strauss (also Spacht Zarathustra), Khatchaturian (Gayne suite), and Ligeti (the requiem and lontano).Altogether a phenomal film that everybody should watch.	5.0	2001 space Odyssey-one of the best films of all times	2014-05-09	0	0	0

To the average movie goer, and in fact, to many critics, this movie is as entertaining as a funeral.  However, for some reason it is trendy for movie critics to love anything Kubrick releases.  That is why this movie is so &quot;highly rated&quot;.  Is it because critics actually like it?  No.  It is because if they show favor for a film NOBODY understands, it makes them look and feel &quot;above&quot; the average person.  That is why this movie is highly rated, and why Kubrick, who is mediocre at best, is adored by the people who are &quot;in the know&quot;.  Like &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, this movie is only entertaining for someone on an acid trip.  So if you want to appear &quot;higher&quot; than the average man, you can go along with the crowd and say how great this movie is.  But if you want to show that you aren't fooled by all the hype, give this movie the rating it deserves.  (Actually, this movie does not deserve the 1 I am going to give it.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	This film was the greatest work made by the master Stanley Kubrick.This movie is built like a Symphony in four movements.Introduction: the dawn of man; we watch in the first thirty minutes , two apes society ; with unsaid rules and a certain perception of the landness. When a monolyte suddenly appears, the sparkilng light of the intelligence enlights them. The aspects concerned with violence, sense of possesion, cruelty, and the taste for meat are visible shown; this step ahead in the evolution is one of the most powerful and extraordinary take ever filmed; the use of a bone as a lethal weapon is linked with the Second movement; we are now in XX century and we are witness of the purpose of the mission to Jupiter.The journey would be the third movement; more specifically depicted as the Adagio , think in the Ninth Synphony's Beethoven; and this long sequence of the experience in the planet will carry us to the Fourth and last movement in which the relativity theory appears: this is the real meaning of the calelidoscopic journey beutifully depicted by a wide and dynamical spectral color frequency ; the concepts of time and space are broken and our hero; (after the epic struggle fight with HAL 900)will land in other dimension in a twilight zone; , a simmetry hall watching himself in a bed surrounded by a barroque style,  with the monolyte as silent witness, in which he will reborn in that unforgettable ending sequence.Inmediatly after Dr. Strangelove, Kubrick engaged literal and really with this tale of Arthur Clark, and five years were spent to get that challenging work.And finally Kubrick shocked the whole world with a movie out of its time ; one legendary cult movie ; a real artistic and cinematographic winner; but the complex lines that support the film easily would surpass the limits of this review.I've always thought since I watched it in 1968 , that Michael Collins in one of his countless thoughts when he turned around the dark side of the moon; the journey sequence certainly would be a leit motive when he faced this vertigo sensation in front the huge universe and the infiniteness sense he felt.The musical employed were another genius touch; from Ligetti to Kachaturian and from Strauss Johann to Strauss Richard 's Zarathustra as a smart link motive between the first and second movement and the end sequence.The special effects are worthy even today. The loneliness in which Dullea is involved when he talks with his family, is suggeted with a dark poetry , visual and musically speaking.You don't have any excuse for not watching this major film.A must in your DVD collection.This film remained until 1972 as the major scifi achievement, but when Tarkovsky filmed Solaris , this one became in a second place.	5.0	An immortal , and mythical film	2004-05-31	5	4	1

I have both the DVD and the Blu-ray, and after watching the Blu-ray and then comparing it to the DVD - you can tell a big differance. This movie over all is a classic, it's one of Stanley Bubrick first movies and one of his best next to Full Metal Jacket. I am kind of appalled by some of the 1 stars from people who say that this movie sucks - they may be young guys who have grown up with movies with CGI and other films with better special effect but you have to understand that this movie was made in 1967 also.

"Rented this one just to laugh at how movie-makers in the 50's and 60's thought the world was going to look in the year 2001. I figured we would see ridiculous flying-cars, jet-packs, meal-in-a-pill, talking-robots, etc. Then I figured I was gonna write a review here talking about how wrong they were (since the year 2001 has already happened and it was nothing like that)and reccomend it just for a laugh. Here's how it really went. I popped it in the player and to my surprise it just looked like a fake documentary about monkeys with a couple of guys in really fake looking monkey costumes. Kind of like Planet of the Apes. 5 minutes in: Still monkeys (no narraration or anything either). 10 minutes in I asked myself ""How are they going to stretch this out for a whole stupid-movie?!"" I will never know. Because when a monkey threw a bone up in the air so high that it went into space and morphed into a rocket-ship I was done with this garbage. Who on earth would predict the year 2001 would be like that!? I returned it shortly after that and rented Mortal-Kombat 2 which was way more realistic with better fighting. In conclusion, you would be much better-off renting a documentary about apes, or even Gorillas in the mist, or maybe Planet of the Apes which this movie is trying to be. AVOID!!

Pauley, who has been nothing but rude to those who do not care for this film-J. Pauley,Though you insist upon licking the boots of the director you have yet to offer anything in the way of helpful commentary. All you do is ridicule those of us who dare to stain the honor of your dearly beloved Kubrick. If you have some great answer to the objections put forth by the ""have-nots"" who don't care for 2001 then by all means let us in on the secret. And please be specific. You seem to love being derisive now let us see if you really have a clue.To all of the other reviewers who liked this film and are upset in any way by our dislike of the same, or simply feel like being helpful, I would also extend a heartfelt invitation to tell us where we have gone wrong. I am earnest in this invitation and would like an honest discussion with you and will carefully consider your thoughts. Please, bear in mind that many of us fully understand the ""deeper meaning"" behind the film and still found it (other than the stunning visuals and HAL) to be a bore. Please steer clear of the ""higher ideals and language"" as some of my fellow reviewers are not philosophy majors and do not care to be beaten to death with over long explanations of a film they already do not like.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2BVCT2MPS6LHI	Huge Viking	"I first saw ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" back in 1984 when it was televised on one of the local independent San Francisco Bay Area channels. This was just after the release of the sequel ""2010 The Year We Make Contact"" that I saw at a theater a short time before with my father. Fortunately, I had a VCR and taped the former, which came out in 1968. I later purchased the DVD (cleaned-up version) released in 2001. The sound quality was enhanced and the music, particularly Richard Strauss' famed opening theme ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" and Johann Strauss II's ""Blue Danube Waltz"", sounded much better in stereo. I was very impressed by the quality of the DVD version.Hal pretty much stole the show as being a highly, intelligent HAL-9000 series computer (voiced by Douglas Rain, who also voiced Hal in the sequel), keeping himself occupied the whole time and putting himself to the fullest, possible use while engaged in a game of chess and defeating astronaut Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) as well as going over his intelligence report with mission commander Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) as the Discovery I was on its maiden voyage to Jupiter before he ""malfunctioned"" and had ""homicidal tendencies"" killing Poole while he was outside the ship replacing the AE-35 antenna unit as well as the extra three-man survey crew, who were in deep hibernation at the time inside hibernaculums, monitored by Hal. An interesting note, though, was how Arthur C. Clarke (the author of the bestselling book) came up with the name ""Hal"". Look at the acronym ""HAL"" by moving up to the next letter from each of the three and you have computer giant ""IBM"".Many existing companies were well-represented in the film, including IBM, such as Pan American World Airways (original airline ceased to exist after failing in bankruptcy court and then new owner Delta Air Lines ""pulling the plug"" in 1992), Howard Johnson's Restaurants (very few of them left back east as of today) and Hilton Hotels. Pan Am did in fact, back in 1968, planned space travel by 2001, stemming from the movie. Eager patrons queued in to purchase tickets at an exorbitant cost in hopes that the airline would provide such a service, which, of course, never materialized. The year 2001 saw the construction of the new International Space Station but no Pan Am.A great sci-fi classic by the late Stanley Kubrick who turned Clarke's fantastic novel into a cinematic, box office smash, this movie is certainly not worth missing for any sci-fi fan."	5.0	Hal Stole the Show!!!	2005-07-17	1	1	0

It was misunderstood and many panned it, and for good reason.  Kubrick's editorial style wasn't and isn't for everybody.  Fast cuts from one scene to another with little to no lead-out or in left many lost in the dust.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1H6H0MUCKOHCJ	Iago the Critic	"Last week I saw an American Cinematheque screening of a 70mm restored print of 2001. I've also seen it a few times on Cinerama screens (which is what it was made for) and in 35mm theatrical screenings. I'm not sure I've ever seen the whole thing on TV or video, but if any movie would lose a lot in translation to those media it's this one. Kubrick was a photographer originally, so when he makes a movie he's not just telling a story that happens to be photographed; he's making pictures that also tell a story. It's your absorption in those pictures, and in the amazing music, that's going to make this movie interesting. If your only concern is information or plot points, then of course it will seem slow. We don't have to hear the entire Blue Danube waltz to understand that two spaceships are docking. But the point of the scene isn't just to inform us that spaceships are docking. It's like a music video, see -- you don't need to watch a whole music video to get the information that some guy is in love with some girl. That could be stated in a sentence. So why does anyone watch music videos? For the music and the images. Those are the point, not the informational content. Same thing here.That said, there is a plot to this film, and to me it's not just interesting, it's suspenseful. Why do many viewers not feel that? I suspect because Kubrick was so totally uninterested in the usual film conventions -- the histrionics typically used to signal danger or threat or emergency. Things don't blow up. The astronauts don't react to events with shouts, screams, ray guns or karate kicks. But guess what? Neither would real astronauts. The people we've actually sent into space are scientists, engineers and test pilots. They're trained to stay calm, and their way of talking is dry as dust. A lot of movie viewers have simply got used to a cartoonish level of overacting and violence that isn't based on observed reality at all, so when a filmmaker gives them TRULY realistic characters they complain that the movie has ""no characters.""There's nothing wrong with preferring big cartoons to the much subtler thing that Kubrick gives us in 2001. To each his own. But I was struck by how young a lot of the people at the screening tonight were. It was a big crowd, some of them looked to be less than half as old as the movie, yet they seemed as absorbed in it as the old-timers. Maybe a new generation has discovered this film; maybe (just a thought) music videos have even helped create a whole new audience willing to lose itself in an experience of images and sound without demanding a lot of ""plot"" in the conventional sense. In any case, I came away thinking that even as the title year recedes into the past, 2001 still has a long life ahead of it."	5.0	A new generation is discovering this movie	2005-02-05	1	1	0

The special effects, imagery, an contrasts are second to none. In my opinion, it the very best of Kubrick, and hence of all time...I saw this film for the first time close to 13 years ago, in 2001, when I was 12. It came on TV and for 5hours (including comercials) I sat bewildered in front of the TV screen.This is a movie that engages you not through constant action, movement, and diverse scenes flashing before your eyes, rather through an unique and captivating mode of storytelling. You must not take you eyes off the screen or allow audio distraction.Nobody can grasp everything in one sitting, and often times this film requires several viewings to grasp all the details.I use it to determine whether a girl is ""date-able"". Always I claim that I've not seen it since I was a kid. Any answer to the question ""what did you think?"" is valid, with the exception of ""boring"" or ""it makes no sense"", as these are signs of narrowminded-ness.With regards to the monolith... people often use the term evolution, however this is incorrect. Evolution does not occur in an individual organism, rather in a population over LONG periods of time.The monolith is enlightenment or inspiration. It is an unknown or enigma, that broadens the mind of those who encounter it. It free's the imagination in an attempt to explain it and allows for an unconventional thought process. The thoughts become ideas, and the ideas technological advancement (Which over long periods may result in evolution). It happened with the Australopithecus leader, with the astronauts on the moon, with HAL, with Bowman, and finally with anyone who see the movie... This was Kubrick's goal, to inspire our imagination and allow us to interpret the film in our own ways.Though most of themes are quite agreed upon, there are still many ambiguous shots and many details that must be payed close attention to. Nothing is random, if it's in the shot it is because Kubrick wanted it to be, and had a purpose for it. The neutrality of the soundtrack and scores provide our subconscious minds with emotions and and our conscious mind with thoughts uninfluenced by emotive audio. Kubrick wants us to interpret the movie in our own way and hopes to inspire us with the monolith, and to give us a neutral environment through sound or lack thereof."	5.0	Kubriphile Clarifying the meaning of the monolith...	2013-09-20	3	2	1

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	ALJWRGOANWDWJ	Jack-O-Lantern	"It's funny how this film polarizes viewers more than almost any other...is it a masterpiece which literally captures on film the metaphysical and spiritual conundrums of our place in the universe?  Or is it a boring, stilted and pretentious by-product of the times in which it was made?I was all of 9 years old when this film was released, and I will say that at that age it bored me to the point of unconsciousness!  That being said, I honestly now believe that this is by far the single greatest motion picture ever made.This film's greatness lies in its ability to adapt itself to each individual's personal thought structure, so that it literally takes on meaning only with the help of one's own spiritual, emotional and psychological imprint.  As such, ""2001"" forces us to come to direct terms with who we are, why we're here, and perhaps even what might be in store (i.e., the ""master plan"").  Many see this as a religious film, others as a commentary on man's insignificance within the larger cosmic palette, still others as a straight-forward futurist melodrama.  It is indeed all these things, and more.  It's a difficult picture to get your arms around, and anything you get out of it, guaranteed, will not be what the person sitting next to you gets out of it.  I recently saw a restored version of this film at a theater, and the reactions of those in the audience ran from sobbing to ebullience to confusion to outright anger (and yes, a few people were snoring!).I might add here that this is not a ""Kubrick"" thing for me--I think he's somewhat overrated for the most part and only a few of his films speak to me, ""A Clockwork Orange"" being certainly his other great achievement.  Kubrick made some films of questionable value too (""The Shining"" being the most problematic, especially when compared to Stephen King's unforgettable source material).Personally, I feel ""2001"" is revelatory in almost every respect.  I see something new in it, feel new emotions, discover new meaning, with each and every viewing.  It is a one-of-a-kind experience and I don't think any other film comes even close to involving me so completely on an emotional and spiritual level.  Here's the rub for some:  many don't WANT to be taken to task by a movie on this level, and thus I can see how some just aren't moved by it--because they don't want to be.My suggestion is to put your day-to-day stuff aside, clear your mind of what's on your desk at work or the housework you need to get to this weekend, sit back and join Kubrick on this legendary journey into the unknown.  ""2001"" is one of the very few films I can think of that has the potential to actually effect profound change in those who view it, and wouldn't that be the very definition of a masterpiece?"	5.0	The Definition of a Masterpiece	2007-08-08	70	55	15
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1I61WIMJ8N66P	jacob jones	Stanley Kubrick's visual masterpiece may possibly be the best film ever produced. Visually stunning and brilliantly edited, this film embodies all of Mr. Kubrick's incredible talent.  Encompassing the human timeline, Kubrick and co-writer Aurthur C. Clark explore the development of the human race at three points in time. The earliest humaniods, to what Kubrick would paint as our near future, to contact with non-human intelligent life.  The &quot;Dawn of Man&quot; sequence is possibly the strangest begining in film history. There is not a word spoken for the first 20+ minutes. The story follows a group of &quot;pre-humans&quot; coping with survival. Their thoughts and fears are all played out without a single word of dialog, but the story is so clear. From dealings with predators, to food shortages, and even the human feelings of paranoia and self doubt.  A shift in human development occurs when a &quot;monolith&quot; appears before our group of &quot;pre-humans.&quot; The monolith is extra-terestrial and there is a transfurance of knowledge, or the ability for knowledge. This is Kubrick's masterstroke. THE UNDERLYING SUGGESTION OF THIS MOVIE IS THAT AN ALIEN RACE WOULD WAIT MILLIONS OF YEARS TO COMPLETE A TASK, WHICH IS TO SPUR INTELLEGENCE IN HUMANIODS, THEREFORE ALLOWING CONTACT. The change occurs immediately. Enlightened by the monolith, one of the humaniods discovers the use of bones as weapons and an amazing change ensues. The tribe is no longer hungry, their paranoia subsides as they sleep soundly. As the group prepares to take back their old watering hole, they are all carrying weapons. Furthermore, the are begining to stand more upright. The beating is fast and brutal, there is no doubt this group of &quot;tool users&quot; are the beginings of the human race.  Fast forward 4 million years to the year 1999. The moon is being colonized, and buried &quot;deliberately&quot; under the moon's surface is the second piece of the puzzle, another monolith. Needless to say the object, and it's meaning is very sensetive information. Regarded as top priorty, a team of scientists is dipatched to study the monolith. When they arrive at the site, a loud transmission is sent from the monolith to Jupiter, allowing more exploration.  The jupiter phaze of the film is terrific. Amazing special effects along with an eerie and tense story line combine for some thrilling movie moments.  Here, as in the begining, Kubrick is a master of the sublime:  DAVE: &quot; OPEN THE POD BAY DOORS, HAL.&quot;  HAL; &quot;THIS CONVERSATION CAN SERVE NO FURTHER PURPOSE, GOOD-BYE DAVE.&quot;  Shot with a 70mm camera, this film is a visual masterpice. Futhermore, the story is probably the most ambitious and imaginative in film history. Kukrick master direction is undeniable, allowing the viewer to interperate their own meaning.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1RMWCN45F0PF9	"J. A. Eyon ""Little Raven"""	Scifi fans reveled in this film for the same reason that JURASSIC PARK was reveled in. The cinema can give a better sense of space stations and dinosaurs than the imagination can.However, many scifi fans and moviegoers in general preferred strong plots to the toned down drama such as found in certain art house filmmakers (eg, Ozu of Japan, Bergman of Sweden, the Italians and French). The long naturalistic scenes bored those people. And they still bore many people. Including me -- even tho I have come to appreciate the naturalism of the likes of Ozu or Hsiao-hsien Hou. I don't think that Kubrick developed the knack for that style.Of course, some of those scenes in this film were there solely for the purpose of introducing furturistic gadgets -- for example, the long, silent shuttle to the moon, and the video phone. Other filmmakers would have tried to integrate those into the story. But, I guess Kubrick thought that seeing them as mundane features of the future helped set the atmosphere.Luckily, the writers included in between all those static scenes three old-fashioned dramas -- the first innovation, the mystery of the discovery on the Moon, and, especially, the battle with HAL by the two astronauts. And those dramas were powerful. And memorable. And contribute to the movie's greatness.There are many enigmatic elements of the story -- eg, what were the monoliths, what did the ending mean. I think they were caused more by shortcomings in Kubrick's creativity and philosophical underpinnings than in an inscrutable wisdom. But they have turned out to be a valuable part of the movie's mystique -- sparking decades of thought and discussion.But, best of all, the story flaws were overwhelmed -- magnificently -- by Kubrick's and his team's technical skills. This pre-CGI film is still an incredible film to watch. And, as long as real-life hasn't caught up technologically with the movie, they will no doubt continue to fascinate.I think that Kubrick's masterful use Classical music (and have it control the story's progression rather than the other way around) has kept it from becoming dated. And his use of sounds (note the realistic ambience of the various settings, the breathing during the space suited scenes) was an extension of his use of music.This adds up to first rate sensual, emotional and intellectual experiences -- for those who can either appreciate or endure the naturalistic scenes.This new DVD (Warner Home Video's 2-Disc Special Edition) has commentary by the two main actors, Kier Dullea and Gary Lockwood. Unfortunately, their rambling commentary rarely discusses what's on the screen. Besides, they don't seem that informed about the other actors. However, the the making of featurette is excellent, especially with Arthur C. Clarke clarifying some of the enigmatic elements of the movie. I would prefer a full hour with Clarke discussing his memories of the making of the movie. The other featurettes that I saw were generally interesting with lots of appearances by other famous directors, film critics and Kutrick's team.

The premise for the plot is OK but the pace, at times, is slowed so the feel for the special effects isn't missed.  This movie is one for everyone's collection but it isn't on the ""If you only had one movie to watch"" list.  The Blu-ray version brings the original Hi-Definition of the movie right into your home."	4.0	2001 in 2008	2008-04-05	2	1	1

Of course the conceit of modern ""art"" is if you don't get it you're somehow retarded.  I'm no scientist, but I did earn a BA from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a 3.3 GPA and a focus on Liberal Arts.  As far as 2001 goes, there are few interesting ideas, that unfotunately are stretched to the limit, and it is technially proficient, but honestly I have considerable concern for the particular type of audience that views this as some sort of masterpiece.  Have they ever kissed a girl?  It may come as a surprise that this film was almost universally panned on its initial release, which was of course spot on, until drug addicts started to see it in droves while high.

It's a couple of months until the release date so I can't say much more at this time.UPDATE 11/17/2012: It is gorgeous in high definition.  The sound seems richer than any old version I've seen. One thing I have a beef about.  They did not include the original theatrical trailer.  It's a re-release trailer.  The only DVD that ever included the correct trailer was the first MGM release of the film back in 1999.  All subsequent releases have not had the original trailer.  I like the original trailer the best of all.  If this film ever gets released again I hope they see fit to include the original trailer.	5.0	A masterpiece in high definition	2007-08-19	25	2	23

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3AR1IP86YNNY3	James P. Wong	Been a fan of 2001 or a long time now, from when I first saw it on television... then to DVD... and now on blu-ray. The quality of the transfer/restoration is just amazing. Kubrick spared no expense on what might be considered trivial details (labels on ships, food, instructions on walls). I was stunned to find such detail considering how old the film is.It's true that because of the high quality, you can see the flaws in older visual effects techniques (painted backdrops, etc). However, this just makes you appreciate how much effort went into this production for such a classic.Combine the best visual quality with an already gripping film and it's a winner. Highly recommended if you haven't seen this on older formats or if you're a fan of the film.	5.0	Stunning Visual Quality on Blu-Ray	2009-07-31	3	3	0

Smith ""JQS"""	The reviews on 2001 are endless, so this is short and sweet.  2001 is best at home through the BD format and as large a flat screen TV you can muster.  I vaguely recall seeing 2001 in Cinerama as a child, later on VHS, then laser disc, then finally DVD.  Only with BD does the movie come as alive as the original theatrical release, but the BD version seems even better ... whether its been remastered, I am older and remember less of my childhood movie days, or more vibrant than a projected image, I know not.  But I do know, the details visible are far more, the images are crisper, the sound is as good or better than the original 1960s theatrical release.  Since 2001 is visual poetry, the better the picture, the better the movie experience.  Well worth owning, as I've seen it again and again, and never tire of it.  2001 in BD has to date been the best format released for home viewing, and I've seen them all.	5.0	Even better on blu-ray	2009-07-29	2	2	0

A scientific background helps. We encounter the idea that human intelligence was jump-started by aliens. When man reaches into space, he is reaching toward his source. This is consistent with the Panspermia theory, that life did not originate on Earth but evolved from spores brought by comets. The film degenerates into a semblance of an LSD trip.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A39EX7IOXOMD0X	"J. Anderson ""jackthetab"""	"Strange, bizarre, slow moving, little script dialog and a sometimes creepy score highlight this film. The special effects are hit or miss, especially with many of the ever slow moving space scenes. Looking at when this movie actually was released (1968), however, makes the effects seem well done for the time period.Overall, this movie is very slow moving at 148 minutes. The pace of the movie moves as if it would while in space, which can sometimes drag on somewhat too far. Furthermore, the lack of dialogue can make scenes seemingly go on forever. The scenes however are beautifully constructed and give the film somewhat of a different feel. This tends to take your mind off the lack of dialogue and enjoy the visual beauty. From the time of the apes, or ""Dawn Of Man"" to the hypnotic fractal sequence of the distant future ahead, the images are more pleasing than the next. The classical score plays a vital role in this film, and tends to project various emotional states for each scene.The HAL 9000 is a very likable character which acts almost as human as any real human, and able to beat a human opponent at chess. Sometimes computers are too smart for mankind, which leads to disaster for the hibernating scientists and the eventual spiral of Daves/main characters life stages. Eventually, and emotionally struck, Dave has to kill HALS life connections. As HAL is disconnected, he sings a song that was first programmed into his memory function.The final sequences, Dave finds himself hovering alone through the skies of Jupiter only to find himself gradually turning older and older until his death. Just before he dies, a black portal slab appears in his bedroom. His soul presumably drifts through this portal. He is then seen as a baby heading towards earth. An interesting interpretation of a black portal that reincarnates ones being back to earth. This portal is also seen in the beginning of the film, in which apes become man and begin to think and learn.Confusing, for sure, however the movie resounds itself as being deep with meaning and conveying the past and future of mankind. If you notice in several scenes, the technology used in this futuristic film, have proven true in today's society. Biometrics using voice print identification, humanoid computer systems that can feel, automated credit card machines, movies in the headrest's etc...Its not a movie for everyone, though has some very exhilerating moments."	3.0	Strange and bizarre spaceness	2008-03-15	3	2	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2K38E6J2GX62K	Jan Dierckx	This review contains possibly a spoiler. I explain what happens at the end of the film. I do this because the end is confusing if you don't know something about the ideas of Arthur C.Clarke, an English scientist and SF writer who wrote the script for this movie along with Stanley Kubrick.The basic idea of the film is that the 'Homo Sapiens' evolved from the apes (Darwin) and the 'Homo Cosmos' will in time evolve from the 'Homo Sapiens'(A.C.Clarke). The 'Homo Cosmos' will be a human creature that is able to live in outer space like we are able to live on Earth. Space will be his natural environment.Arthur C.Clarke writes about this idea ( and many other scientific speculations ) in his book 'Profiles of the Future', first published in 1962 - he calls it 'An inquiry into the limits of the possible' - and revised in 1999 for millennial edition published by Indigo.Before I carry on I have to say that the characters in this film are very cold and distant (all of them with perhaps the exception of the six year old daughter of one of the scientists.)They are polite but they could be mindless robots. I don't know if this was on purpose or that the scriptwriters didn't care about human psychology.The movie has four parts.First is the long winded part where you can witness the daily life of large apes. I presume that stunt men crawled almost literally in the skin of those apes. The special make-up must have cost a fortune. I give the film 4 stars because this first part is extremely slow-paced and is of very little importance for the rest of the film.You start wondering if you are watching the wrong movie but at the end of that first part, you understand that the basic idea was that the apes are climbing up the ladder of evolution by using large bones as a tool or a weapon.In the second part some scientists travel to the moon (there are already several colonies on the moon), to visit a mysterious artifact dug up in the vicinity of one of the colonies. We are told that the artifact points toward Jupiter where possibly another artifact can be found, floating like a satellite around the giant planet.The third part is the mission to Jupiter. Something happens and the only survivor of the mission takes one of the space-capsules. He uses the gravity of Jupiter to gain speed and he makes a discovery voyage beyond Jupiter. The enormous speed he has is one of the most impressive scenes of the film.In the fourth and last part of the movie, we witness the decay of the Homo Sapiens and we look at the foetus of the Homo Cosmos, floating in outer space.A professional reviewer called The Space Odyssey a movie with a pessimistic vision. He apparently didn't read 'Profiles of the Future' because if there is one SF movie that is optimistic and welcomes the future with open arms (so to speak) it's The Space Odyssey.After all, a whole new kind of humans with different and powerful possibilities is about to be born.	5.0	The Future of Mankind.	2006-05-02	0	0	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2PBDB92U5WIJA	Janis Cortese	"Stanley Kubrick was similar to George Lucas and David Lynch in that none of them could tease actual emotion out of their actors, or even want to.  They could set up lovely shots, as long as there are no actual people on screen.  This movie is the perfect example of that.  It may have been ""revolutionary"" for its time, but ultimately it took two fairly good actors and forced them to play planks of wood about whom the audience couldn't care less.  It was left to the book version of ""2010"" to give a reader enough backstory about Bowman to enable a viewer of ""2001"" to care about his fate.""2001"" is a fairly straightforward story that was told in as incomprehensible a manner as possible, in order to make it seem more profound.  Ultimately, it's a particularly stilted ""male"" movie in that character work is entirely absent, a machine is the most interesting person on screen, and the only women of note are Space Stewardesses.  The macho, Robert Ardrey-inspired ""African Genesis"" introduction is also painfully bad.It's a classic all right, but every time I see it, I can't help but wonder how much better it would have been had Kubrick attempted to approach the story in anything like a realistic psychological fashion -- and had the two lead actors actually been permitted to move their faces.  Both Dullea and Lockwood have done good work elsewhere, and it was a shame that Dullea in particular became known for his role in an iconic movie that showcased everything BUT its actors.It looks lovely, and it redefined what a movie could look and sound like, at least.  (The following decades of SF movies owe their beautiful orchestral scores to ""2001,"" banishing the chintzy theremin scores of the SF movies of the 50s.)  Watch it, appreciate it as the watershed film that it was for its time, and then put it away and find something that doesn't try to prove that humans will stop being human because we have newer, shinier techno-toys to play with."	3.0	Lovely but utterly sterile	2004-09-01	17	3	14

Who could ever forget the uplifting music and scenery? And who could ever forget how the computer HAL cut off the oxygen line of one of the astronauts?2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY has ramifications beyond entertainment. It was made at a time when space flight was new, and the manned lunar landing of 1969 was just on the horizon. In the heady days of the 1960's, it was commonly believed that manned interplanetary space flight would be a reality by about the year 2000--hence the quasi-factual basis for this movie.Instead, the opposite happened. After the last manned Apollo flight of 1972, no space flight has gone beyond Earth orbit. Here is well after 2001, and manned interplanetary space flight has not gone beyond the hypothetical stage.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1P7DQBJAQJOG9	Jared R. Clement	About the film: One of its greatest strengths is its openness to interpretation.  Reading reviews from others may influence your interpretation, which should be avoided until you've made your own assessment.  Reading reviews of 2001 prior to your first viewing is tricky business, as most reviewers tend to discuss the more enigmatic parts of the film, which everyone should interpret personally.  Even that, I fear, may be saying too much... all you need to know is that 2001 is a great film and well worth your time.About this release (BluRay): Don't expect a home theater showpiece (from 1968, what do you expect), but there's nothing to complain about here.  2001's a beautiful movie and this release does it justice.	5.0	Don't read any reviews before watching this!	2008-03-16	5	4	1

It's not often that I see a movie that inspires the sort of awe like the kind I got from watching 2001. 2001 is an epic science fiction masterpiece. For someone who is interested in space travel, astronomy, computers, philosophy, as well as science and science fiction... 2001 is too good to be true.The movie directly deals with man's place in the universe, and his own evolution and development through time like no other movie I've seen. It dares to, in detail, explore concepts like space exploration, hyper-intelligent computers, the vastness of space, and the prospect of alien intelligence.The visual effects are outstanding. Considering that this movie was released in 1968, it just makes it more impressive. The effects are always believable and engrossing. Truly a spectacular movie, with oh so much eye candy.The characters are, with one ironic exception, not very complex or detailed. This is alright, as 2001 doesn't have a character centered story, and the one exception I mentioned, is so good.A lot of people, especially those expecting a more traditional finale, won't like the ending to the movie. The ending is just really, really strange. Believe me, you have no idea. That said, I found one of the great joys of the movie was trying to interpret the ending, trying to piece together in my mind exactly what happened. Everybody seems to have their own interpretation, and that's one area I think where the film really outshines the book.All in all, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a brilliant film, a cinematic piece of art that everyone should see at least once.	5.0	A dazzling, thought provoking vision of the future	2011-05-10	3	3	0

The packaging is terrible with a flipper-type case with a cardboard cover.As for the film itself, it is definitely a landmark. I first saw this as a child in the theater and have admired it since then. The cinematography is fantastic and modern directors should examine it closely to learn how to do a long camera shot which seems to be a lost art. Fabulous soundtrack and score which might have served as many person's introduction to classical music. Many people do not understand this film, for those I heartily recommend that you first read the novel. There are so many films that would have not been possible without this film coming first, the Star Wars films are a good example. It was groundbreaking in its time and has aged very well. Most of the predictions for space travel introduced by this film have never been realized, showing just how advanced it was. It is my opinion that this film was made at the peak of Kubrick's career and is a visual festival with very little dialogue.Even now, I still lust for one of those pods!	5.0	2001 in 2003	2003-03-07	4	2	2

"After reading a few reviews and having noticed the contrast in opinion over this film, I will attempt to clear up the matter for those thinking about buying this film.  After all, some reviewers would rather listen to themselves talk about why their opinion is righteous and all encompassing.Short of insulting people's intelligence (a hallmark of a true insensitive moron), and even challenging those who like it to a fight (kind of strange)... or equally as bad, blindly praising it... Here's a break down of why you will or won't like it, a buyer's guide.YOU'LL LIKE IT BECAUSE2001 is a visual time capsule.  You can sit back and watch it in wonder, ponder its themes of humanity and progress, technology and change, and enjoy the surprisingly interesting effects.  It is ""artsy,"" beautiful, and strange.  This film is truly one of a kind.  Its meaning and themes are wide open for discussion.  If going in to it you know that this is more of a themed visual symphony than a movie, you will be pleased.  Keep an open mind, and don't wait for the apes to stumble upon Charlton Heston or sliced bread or invent the wheel.YOU'LL DISLIKE IT BECAUSEThe film is quite long-winded and ambiguous.  If you're looking for a Star Trek-like action film or ET-like sci-fi drama, you will end up selling yours back.  Among the many interesting qualities of this film, dialogue is not one of them.  It is almost void of human speech as a way of communicating its ideas.  Also, the story line is not defined in clear, simple terms as a regular ""movie"" would.  In fact, this is not really a movie.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2JTCIWD50EG4B	"Jeffrey Belcher ""gigusa"""	2001 speaks on another level visually.There is nothing more eerie or awe inspiring than watching the very beginning of the film...darkness, nothing else for 2 minutes while dissonant strings rumble beneath.The Dawn of Man sequence at the beginning is pure visual minimalist art...no dialogue, no nothing.  Just watch...  It is here that we're first introduced to the dull black monolith that ties the film together in the most cryptic of ways.By the time you reach the &quot;meat&quot; of the film, you realize that you're over twenty minutes into it and you haven't heard a word.  It was a beautiful moment for me the first time that happened.  The music is phenomenal and appropriate from scene to scene...being massively disturbing at points and gently graceful at others.H.A.L. has got to be one of the most unsettling film villains in history.  Calm, calculating...flawed.  His (it's) demeanor of logic and rationalizing makes sense yet is very cruel.  I actually found myself sympathizing with H.A.L.  This is film making taken to the Nth degree.  Simply amazing.&quot;Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite&quot;, the film's beautifully bizarre last chapter presents us with stunning computer-generated effects and the disturbing scenario of living an entire life in moments.  When the final frame rolls by and you're left to put the film together in retrospect, you find yourself confounded, yet amazed by what you've just seen.	5.0	Haunting	2001-01-23	5	4	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1ZHXINCOPF7OR	Jeffrey F. Bell	"To me, the most interesting aspect of 2001 is the huge role the film has played shaping the popular image of the human race's future in space. I saw the film on its first release in 1968 at age 13, and it played a big role in steering me into my first career as a space scientist. In conversations with other Space Cadets, this film is by far the most cited influence (even among people who weren't even born yet in 1968). People are always asking me ""Why don't we have those orbiting hotels and underground Moon bases?  Why are we sending those dorky robot probes to Jupiter instead of DISCOVERY?  What went wrong?""My answer to them is: This film wasn't a serious attempt to predict the exact technical or political future of the real space program. The spaceships and space stations were designed  strictly for looks and aren't based on any real science or engineering. Just look at the Pan Am space shuttle or the moon bus. They don't have any sensible propulsion systems, and their flight dynamics are ludicrously wrong.  The space travel sequences in the film are glorious eye candy, but they are really just background props for the story, like the trench system in PATHS OF GLORY or the B-52 cockpit in DR. STRANGELOVE.Even more wrong is the political background of the space program in 2001.  When bland organization man Heywood Floyd meets some bland Soviet commissars in the Orbital Hilton, their conversation makes it clear that the Cold War is still raging, and that space exploration is still mostly motivated by nationalistic competition.  This might have seemed likely when Kubrick and Clarke planned the film in 1965-66, but by the time it appeared in 1968 political support for a vast government space program was already collapsing in the USA and was essentially gone by 1971.So view this film for its artistic merits, or as a historical document. Don't expect space travel to be like this, ever."	5.0	The Future of the Past	2005-06-05	3	2	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1X7STZO4YNVXR	Jeffrey H. Schmidt	"The novel ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was based on the film, not the other way around, and came out after?  The film, ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" is an ORIGINAL production, and was the result of a collaborative effort between Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke.  The idea for 2001 came from Clarke's short story, ""The Sentinel,"" which does contain some of the story elements and themes used for 2001, but is much less broad.  The greatest incarnation of this story is the film version.This is one of the greatest films ever made, and it's certainly Stanley Kubrick's magnum opus.  A masterpiece!  Like many other works of fine art, this film is imbued with great depth, and therefore requires some intelligence on the viewer's part to fully appreciate it.  This is not your typical, garden variety, action packed sci-fi movie, with lots of meaningless dialog and a spoon-fed plot.  2001 requires a little effort on your part.  It requires imagination.  You have to pay attention when watching - this story is told through images, not words!  I've heard the old complaint about the ""slowness"" of this film from many folks over the years, and I would argue that it is the shallow intellect of these people that make the film seem slow to them.  If the pace bothers you, consider the pace of human evolution, which is a major theme of this story."	5.0	To all the Morons who put down one star...	2001-06-12	11	6	5
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3KY68OTSNHM3G	Jeffrey T. Munson	"""2001"" is a countdown to tomorrow, a roadmap to human destiny, and a quest for the infinite, as well as a tremendous visual experience.To begin the voyage into the future, the dawn of a possible origin of mankind is shown.  Ape-like creatures, beset by horrors of a world they cannot control, try to survive.  Into their world comes a black monolith, and soon the creatures learn to use bones for weapons.  The monolith seems to have boosted the creatures' intelligence.The next part of the film shows a spacecraft travelling to a spacestation.  Both the ship and the station are superbly done.  The destination is the moon, where another of the mysterious monoliths is found.  While the monolith is being examined, a radio signal is received from one of Jupiter's moons.  Naturally, the crew of the spacecraft deside to investigate.On the way to Jupiter, the crew of the spacecraft runs into a problem with their HAL 9000 computer.  Originally designed to assist the crew and complete with a human voice, HAL has become paranoid about the mission and has decided to kill all of the crewmwmbers.  Dr. Dave Bowman (Kier Dullea) survived.  Unfortunately for Dave, he's outside of the ship when HAL goes crazy, but he manages to get back inside and disable HAL.Another monolith is encountered, which leads to a passageway to a different region of space.  Bowman, a young man when the ship entered the passage, has aged considerably when the ship emerges.  Once he reaches his destination, the aging continues until, ultimately, he transforms into the star child.  I believe that the creation of the star child signaled the completion of the cycle of life, and it also represents the beginning of a new and more intelligent generation.This is an excellent sci-fi film that has become a classic, and served as a forerunner to such classic films as ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters"".  The lack of dialogue (only about 40 minutes' worth) makes for some difficult viewing, but the special effects more than make up for it.  It does require careful viewing so that the true meaning of the movie may be understood.  I'm a big sci-fi fan, and I recommend this fine movie.

Shimkus ""Movie Manji"""	"A film with an opening of 23 minutes of no dialogue, a closing drama of at least the amount; of the same, ineffable, style. Abound with a ""viewer translation""; giving a more flavorable taste for art, the true quality of art house. When one looks on a complex message from an artist, A clear and easily read summary is hardly within the pardons of sympathy. In another way of explaining it, I quote from Arthur C. Clark, ""If a viewer walks away from 2001 with all of the answers, then I would say we hardly did our job correctly.""Space was hardly looked on with so much taste, before, but then hardly after. This movie is inspiration to our generation and the ones following after. It opens doors on the hopeful and endless possibilities of space travel, where both director Kubrick and writer Clark hoped would prepare future generations for the crashing disillusionment when met with another, foreign contact in space. Where, rather poignant (in Kubricks style), the dehuminization of mankind: The fall or insignificance (at least the open possibility)in the fatherly watch of a cold monolith. Under the watch, from early dawn of man, where a defuct proto man is inspired to use tools, to the proud accomplishment of prudent man of the future:AI. Which, in a line of unnerving events yet to unravel, is discovered to be yet another mistake unforseen. Curiousity is met with a harse hand, and all the while, a mysterious question is left to anyone who watches this film, who are the ones who have been watching us for so long? And what is the meaning of their curiousity? Not an answer to be called wrong nor right,but merely a question that is to be handled subjectively."	5.0	A mature take on science fiction	2005-04-04	1	1	0

The way the evolution of intelligence is portrayed is second to none in any of the films I've seen.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1VTHUZIN04QQW	Jeremiah J. Timmins	2001.  This is a film, not a movie.  It's art, not entertainment.  When you are entertained your mind is fed.  When you experience art, your mind works.As a piece of art, it is beautiful and inspirational.  Beyond speculation on ET's 'sponsoring' us to the next levels of evolution, or AI, the film is flawless in technical detail.2001 inspired every space-based sci-fi movie that followed it, from Star Wars (With long, slow shots of massive, white starships.) to Aliens (With the android Bishop and his gentle voice, and the lonely classical music as the Sularco traveled through space.)Another great feature about this movie is the lack of explanation.  You watch to see what's happening.  OK, they are in a rotating chamber.  I guess that must simulate gravity.  Frank Pool is spinning endlessly into space because there's no force to stop him.  Even without dialogue, the acting is great.  Just watch the closeup of David Bowman as he realizes that Hal is NOT going to open the pod bay doors.  Kubrick's actors must ACT, because his shots are usually so long that nothing will hold the audience's attention except believable acting.Overall, an excellent film that will probably never seem dated.-- JJT	5.0	&quot;I'm sorry Dave, but I can't do that.&quot;	2001-06-23	2	1	1

Think back to old style theatre, when  people went to a play or opera or other form of popular entertainment they  generally knew the story already.  This film suffers from a lack of that  information.  The point of the performance is not the story itself but the  presentation and interpretation of the story.  Read the book or a serious  plot synopsis before watching this movie for the first time, and if you  have an open mind you will appreciate the beauty of the film and the power  of its message.	5.0	I've figured out the problem.	2000-02-09	1	1	0

I think they did focuse a little bit too much on the visual side and not enough on the plot itself. It does seem long and drawn out at times, and without reading the novel or seeing the sequel, the end can be quite confusing. But after rewatching it, I found that it does have a lot to offer. Becides the special effects, which are breathtaking without a doubt, It does bring up some interesting questions about life, life's meaning, and our very beginnings and existence too. Plus it has a cool psycho killing computer in it as well.There are some great scenes in it, like the beginning of the film set at ""The Dawn of Man"" where it suggests that extraterrestrial life was in fact responsible for our creation, the scenes set on the moon, the part where the spacecraft's computer malfunctions and starts killing the crew, and Bowman's journey through the stargate.This movie is for hardcore sci-fi fans and would not interest anyone who might just like the occasional sci-fi spoof, this is for hardcore sci-fi buffs and even then you might not like it the first time round, but just keep an open mind, maybe read the novel or see the sequel before judging it, watch it a couple of times, once you get what the film is about, it will blow your mind and you might love it after that. It took me a while to like it, but I have to admit I love it now, and I'm glad I gave it a second chance.Highly recommended!"	4.0	Didn't like it at first, but it sort of grows on you!	2011-01-18	36	1	35

The average joe enjoys the strange and fascinating scenes but he doesn't generally get anything from  them. He just says&quot; Wow that was wild! I wonder what it was  about.&quot; The fact that there was less than 40 minutes of dialogue in  the 139 minutes of the film, and that three-fourths of the film was  composed entirely of shots of slow moving spaceships was probably the cause  of this general stupor among the public. But the public was able to gleen  enough out of the film to enjoy it.

If you're really philisophical, you'll like this movie a lot.  But even if you want some  good action, the part of the movie with Hal is really suspensful.  The  ending of the movie, however, I found to be uninspiring.  Kubrick, I think,  got caught up in his own way out there image and didn't give a logical,  comprehensible ending.  It was open to too much personal interpretation  with not enough guidance.  The point of the movie doesn't really hold  together at the end.

After viewing, I felt myself yearning for it to be true. Almost every movie on the market is dominated by dailogue, maybe that is why this movie is such a breath of fresh air from mindless action movies and even good dramas.It is rare for movies to make you wonder, think, or be changed as much as this movie does.  The unpatient will not like this movie, which, I admit, is mostly teens.  I'm probably the only one who likes the movie in my school.  The movie at times moves almost painfully slow, which is the contrary to almost every other movie, that is why it is so great.Though the best thing about this movie is the wonder.  It evokes the mind into things it has never thought before, which I think, is the best thing a movie can do.  To make one think.  The monolith can mean anything the viewer wants it to, which gives an unbelievable sense of freedom that no others offer.  And the enlightening image of the starchild at the climax is one of the most mind-blowing scnenes in cinema history.Other than the recognized components of this movie, there are also others that stick out.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2CUPSHGHU290Q	J. Malay	This movie deserves a little more credit from people who give it an F because after all it is pretty thought provoking. However, those who give it an A are giving it way to much credit. I think the people who really really like this movie are the type who believe anything is art. You know the type I mean. Those who look at a canvas that a monkey painted and think it's very deep and complex, or those that love something old and different just because it's considered classic.The movie does have some interesting notes, but there are so many horrible elements. Everything is overkill. Scenes drag out way to long, and dramatic music is over used to the point it's annoying and no longer dramatic. The people mentioned above will find this fascinating simply because it's different. It is different but that fact alone does not make it good.Credit does have to be given to the special effects. Great for the day, which is why I rated the visuals so high.So people on both sides should give credit where credit is due. This movie is decent at best.

No obnoxious anti-piracy short, no coming soon to Blu-Ray...just the movie.  Sweet.  Color and contrast are punchy, yet maintain a film-like natural quality.  Also, the setup menu provides options to optimize the video settings for different types of rooms and ambient lighting.  It was the staggering improvement in the soundtrack that impressed me most.  This movie sounds utterly amazing.  All of the ambient sounds draw you into each scene, adding to the credibility of Kubrics uber-realistic visual effects.  You will hear at least three things in every scene that were indiscernable in the DVD mix.  This is a completely different experience than watching the DVD.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3HXA4HYTG9PQN	"""jnatem"""	"There are many arguments both praising and minimizing the artistic quality of this film. I imagine that I have heard or read most of them. None are wrong, just as none are necessarily correct. Nevertheless, in order to attempt an educated and well-informed analysis of 2001, one should keep in mind that it will mean something different to each viewer depending upon his or her own individual frame of reference. Accordingly, to make a blanket statement such as ""this movie is worthless"", or even ""this movie is the best ever"", does nothing but demonstrate one's failure to grasp what is perhaps the most important characteristic of the film...it's uncertainty. True, the overall entertainment value of the movie is purely subjective, which is why I state that there are no right or wrong observations in that department, however, we must remember that this is not a film about an individual(s) per se, but about the human race. In this sense the film takes on more objective issues than first realized, and instead of attempting to answer them for you, Kubrick leaves us with the freedom to imagine and create our own answers. In essence, he is constantly pulling us between the subjective and objective, hoping to leave us stranded somewhere in the interim of thought. Perhaps this is our true and only intended destination as viewers of this film. The question is, can you allow yourself to be taken there?I hope that no one out there is under the illusion that the human race, like the film, can simply be praised as ""good"" or condemned as ""worthless"". To do so would underscore both the range of our species and the film itself. Life is not black and white; it is gray, as is the nature of the film. To demonstrate this Kubrick leaves ambiguous many parts, enabling us to examine the result of his decisions while unhindered by pretextual certainties. The specific reasons for revealing to us some things, and not others, we may never know. Perhaps to focus on that part of his direction would be missing the point. And what exactly is the point? I believe to create a mystery that becomes more trivial the closer it is examined, and less of a mystery when simplified. Like life, the meaning(s) of 2001 grow and breathe each time it is viewed. On the other hand, in many ways it remains the same. In this respect, the film becomes a living examination of the human race...a truly timeless observation that will intrigue viewers for generations to come.It is hard to deny that this film is the granddaddy of modern science fiction as applied to the mysteries of the universe. The special effects were unprecedented for it's time, and the presentation patently Kubrick. In recent years we have seen such films as ""Mission to Mars"", ""Red Planet"", ""Contact"", ""Stargate"", and numerous others attempt to raise in similar fashion, and in some cases successfully, the question ""why are we here""? This is an intellectual question, and whether you draw your opinions (they are opinions, not answers) from the metaphysical or tangible, simple or elaborate, you must leave room for the variable. The constant of change. The unknown. This is why 2001 is such a masterpiece, it leaves open those channels of information for the viewer to interpret, and Kubrick does not feel the need to overwhelm us with his own interpretations (at least up to a point).In short, this film is what you make of it, which is a lot like life itself (seeing any themes here yet?). I believe many interpretations is what Mr. Kubrick wanted the audience to provide, not one single concrete answer. Ambiguity is the reason some people will always view this film as the project where Kubrick bit off more than he could chew, because in their mind, something cannot have meaning unless people agree. This is shortsighted and remedial thinking, something that Kubrick has probably never been accused of. To declare that 2001 is a muddled work, the only purpose of which is to afford pretentious people like myself the opportunity to proffer up far-fetched ideas and theories is just plain...well, then again, maybe those people are right after all. I mean, aren't we intellectual dreamers the ones who have been trying to figure out the universe since the dawn of thought, only to fail in the sense that we are no closer now to unlocking it's secrets than a thousand years ago? Is this failure? Or are we successful simply because we try?  Now, what was this movie about again?!!!"	5.0	Keep This Film In Perspective...If You Can	2002-12-26	6	4	2

I saw it twice in the theater, and have never been able to thoroughly enjoy it at home... until now. On Blu-Ray disc, viewed on a 40"" Samsung LCD HD television (1080p, of course), I can see everything Stanley Kubrick envisioned for this movie, and the details are stunning. For younger viewers who have grown up with the staggering developments in Special FX (ever since the early days of George Lucas' ""Industrial Light & Magic""), the ""effects"" will seem somewhat primitive.

Younger viewers (like me when I originally tried to watch) won't get it...and find the lack of MTV style split second scene changes to be ""boring"". Now as an adult I can say that this film is far from boring and the camera work is mesmerizing to say the least. Why haven't more filmakers followed Kubrick's lead in the past 40 years or so? Even as someone who grew up in the age of MTV I can appreciate this kind of filmaking...and I agree with other reviewers that the miniature models do look more realistic than the CG used in modern sci-fi.Bottom line is that even if you don't like sci-fi you will have to agree that the encoding and transfer to Blu-ray was done very well..and not just very well considering how old the film is. Kudos to all who were involved in making this BD transfer as well as the extensive list of interesting extras.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1QLJQCTVJAZFE	John C. Sherwood	"This new two-disc DVD set is well worth adding to any ""2001"" fan's collection if only to get the second disc, which has all of the interviews and featurettes. The recorded (no video) interview with Stanley Kubrick also is extremely interesting, particularly if you're a film buff; toward the end, Kubrick speaks glowingly of Arthur Clarke, which is refreshing considering that, at the time of the interview, he was keeping Arthur at the end of his financial tether.The disc with the film is intriguing because of the (sporadic) commentary provided by Lockwood and Dullea, but I consider it a grave mistake not to have included additional commentary from others involved in the production. I am grateful that we have any DVD commentary at all, of course, but many of Gary Lockwood's comments aren't especially pertinent, and both are left to flail and misremember information which they were not fully prepared to conjure up or reference. We do feel, though, that by the end we've gotten to know these two performers better, and that in itself is enjoyable.I haven't made any inquiries, but it strikes me as reprehensible -- and worthy of some sort of explanation -- that the commentary track doesn't include material from Arthur C. Clarke, Daniel Richter (Moonwatcher), the special-effects wizard Douglas Trumbull or Frederick Ordway, who served as the technical science consultant to Kubrick; all of these gentlemen are still with us, and no doubt would have been glad to be involved. Fortunately we still meet and hear them all on Disc 2, but what wonderful expertise we could have been treated to while watching the film if we could hear, say, Richter commenting on the ""Dawn of Man"" sequence instead of Lockwood and Dullea, neither of whom were involved directly.It also would have been a service to include comments at length from one or more noted film critics or historians, who could have put the entire film -- and notable sequences -- into historical perspective from a cinematic viewpoint. On Disc 2, Roger Ebert does provide some thoughts, but they strike me as brief and cursory.Still, this DVD set is as good as it's going to get for awhile, and -- I repeat -- I'm glad to have it. Though the initial sequence shows the moon too dark to be visible at all (in the theater it was quite clear), the image of the film in general looks terrific and includes colors I haven't seen in years. And yet, because of the glaringly missed opportunities the commentary track represents, I feel as though more remains to be done.  Dare we hope for an improved commentary track on the 3- or 4-disc Criterion Collection set someday ...?"	5.0	The best we can get - for now - but with missed opportunities	2007-11-16	27	24	3
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2JLPMANR785YS	John Davis	Reading through some of the reviews of 2001: A Space Odyssey reminds me of why it is such a great film. There is no middle ground with greatness. The detractors of these objects which are considered great are usually dead set against. For example, some people love Ronald Reagan, and some people couldn't stand him. Some people loved Franklin D. Roosevelt, and some hated him. Yet these two figures are considered great. I could go on and on with examples from history, pop culture, and other various areas of humanity.The same can be said about this film. There is no middle ground with the film. Some think it is the epitome of science fiction, an artistic masterpiece, ahead of its time, and utterly breathtaking. Others think that it is a boring, senile film with garish special effects and little plot to boot.I am of the former. I think this film is one of the greatest films of all time. The special effects to this film, even to this day, are great. But it takes a lot more to appreciate this film. It takes an open mind. You can't truly appreciate this film unless you open your mind a little to this movie. This movie was not made for popcorn. It isn't filled with action. Instead, it requires you to think... to use your mind.Pretty much everything that could have been thought of has been covered by other reviews.

Okay, that's six. But who's counting...I know that some folks don't like this film because it's not full of space ships blasting each other into kingdom come but, for sheer believability and sense of awe, this is a marvelous film.  Keep in mind that this film just predated our landing on the moon.  This is the only film I know of that has the nerve to correctly depict the silence of space in all its glory.This film spans multiple millions of years and depicts humanity's birth and movement into whatever's next.

Clarke.  ""2001"" relies on images more than words to convey its multi-layered tale, which starts with the dawn of man. Profound and cerebral, the film may feel slow and ponderous to those accustomed to ""Star Wars"", and its vision of the near-future betrays its 1968 origins.

The movie has ideas and makes one think. However, when a movie requires multiple viewings, it should at least invite one to do so with intrigue and entertainment and not with invitations to prove ourselves worthy of being intellectuals. To have to interpret the meanings on our own we often find things by over reaching. I admire Kubrick but he is not perfect.In short, I admire 2001 but I didn't like it. I have read interpretations about the film and many interesting things have been said but this does not make the film a good one, not when you have to fight the urge to fast forward that space shuttle and move on.	2.0	ambitious but sloooooow...	2013-05-10	6	2	4

There seem to be two camps of movie viewers for this film, those who don't get it and hate it and those who don't get it and love it.Something to consider is that apart from the subplot of the human race discovering and pursuing an otherworldly race, the film is about that which is beyond our comprehension.  The idea that man may be less than the sum of the universe and destined to enter someday into a larger world where his knowledge will be reduced to a pittance is an important theme here.  The film expertly takes us from the realm of the understandable to that of a disorienting new reality.  Those who complain of the fimmakers use of time and silence are the same who would complain of a painters use of red and blue.  Those who claim to have unraveled the true meaning as if it were some hidden jackpot are tethered to convention.  My advise is to try it. If you're a fan you will know after five minutes.  If you're a detractor the same will apply. Fans will buy it.Try letting go of the meaning. Not everything has to have one. Take the journey all the way and accept that there will be things beyond us that will require acceptance just because they are.My personal view for what it's worth is that this is one of the greatest cinematic works of all time. Kubrik's use of cinema is pure, powerfull and inspired.You will be in the presence of genius - like it or not.	5.0	STOP MAKING SENCE	2004-02-22	5	4	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AKT8TGIT6VVZ5	John Kwok	No science fiction film has been more successful in portraying mankind's potential space-borne future than &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. It is still among the most realistic portrayals of how human exploration of the Solar System may unfold. Sadly, that exploration has not kept the pace envisioned by Stanley Kubrick and his collaborator, noted science fiction writer and visionary Arthur C. Clarke. The film is based on Clarke's early short story &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, a science fiction literary classic. Those who pay heed to negative comments by previous reviewers will miss a genuine cinematic masterpiece replete with vivid imagery and great special effects. Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood give credible performances as the American astronauts aboard the USS Discovery, though the finest performance is by the actor who is the voice of HAL (HAL 9000, the Discovery's computer.). Incidentally, &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans will remember Gary Lockwood for his portrayal of Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell, the ill fated first officer of the Starship Enterprise and friend of her captain, James T. Kirk, in the series' second pilot, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;. &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; broke ground for the great space films that followed, including the &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, yet none of these have depicted space travel as realistically as this seminal work of science fiction cinema.	5.0	The Greatest Science Fiction Film of the 1960's	2001-05-25	7	6	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1COW0UIB5HA9J	"John Lindsey ""John"""	"In the beginning before man appeared, apes roamed the Earth and they discovered a mysterious black object from outer space that somehow made them intelligent. Flash-cut to the 21st century in the far future, technology has evolved and so has space travel where Astronauts and people can explore whatever place they want in the farest reach of space. Astronauts David Bowman (Keir Duella) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) sets off to Jupiter on a spaceship Controlled by an artificial Intelligence machine named Hal-9000 (Voiced by Douglas Rain), whoever Hal-9000 begins to threaten our astronauts as they race to find out what is the mystery of the universe.One of the all time greatest motion pictures of all time! Stanley Kubrick and co-writer Arthur C. Clarke has created a motion picture of epic porportions. This film has went on to become one of the most influential and inspiration motion pictures of all time! sure it's a little long and too slow for some audiences but it stimulates the mind and imagation of the viewer. It's even a philosophy about mankind and what is the meaning of life, death and rebirth through the eyes of a traveling astronaut and his struggle against machine as he seeks what the truth is. This is a true masterpiece in every sense of the word and one of the most important motion pictures ever created! it's provokes both the thoughts and eyes of the viewer with incredible special effects and a timeless yet complicated storyline with classical music. This Space Opera set a major standard in Sci-fi for years to come as it has stood the test of time.This Blu-Ray offers spectacular sound and great picture quality! the extras are amazing too like audio commentary, four featurettes, 2001: FX and Early Conceptual artwork gallery, Audio-only bonus with a rare 1966 Kubrick interview, a documentary called ""2001: The Making of a Myth"", ""Look: Stanley Kubrick"" which has a collection of photos from his days as a camera man and the theatrical Trailer."	5.0	Kubrick's masterpiece!	2008-12-05	4	3	1

Burt	"This is a beautiful film, depicting an awe-inspiring event occurring in a world which needs one.I hate to quote, even in paraphrase, Ronald Reagan (or rather whoever wrote the lines he read, probably Peggy Noonan), but the vision of the future depicted in this film is not a dream that failed us: we failed it.We could have had giant rotating space stations built by co-operating great powers, cities on the Moon and an expedition to Jupiter by 2001.  We didn't fail to do that because we couldn't.  We simply chose to do other things, things which seemed more important to us.It would be nice to have all those things.  It would also be nice to have a Star-Child come to rescue us from our idiocies:""There before him, a glittering toy no Star-Child could resist, floated the planet Earth with all its peoples . . .

In LA they called it Cinerama, even though it wasn't in 3 camera projection. Didn't matter. This is one of the great films, a film that changed the way we see films, what we expect of film narrative, the use of music in film to propel narrative. Kubrick was a master and this is a must for anyone who is interested in film history. Classic, iconic and unforgettable!Looking forward to the special edition DVD made from original 70mm elements.	5.0	Can't wait to own this DVD	2001-06-06	3	3	0

It was presented in Blu-ray.  One of the problems was the clarity of the superimposed titles:  ""JUPITER MISSION 18 MOnths later,"" etc.  Another problem was the brightness/contrast of the transfer.  For example, actor Leonard Rossiter's face simply did not glow from the lights hitting his face as I recall in previous flim showings.  However, most infuriating were the washed out colors!  Bowman's space suit which is red, was ORANGE on this blu-ray disc!I have not seen the standard DVD, BUT if I were to choose between the two, I'd take my chances with that one over the blu-ray.  Until the technology is improved, I will not be seeing this on blu-ray gain.Goddard once quipped about ""the end of cinema.""  He was wrong.

The ape to superman.Man vs. Machine.Are we really all alone,a grain of sand in a ocean of nothingness,or is the universe teeming with life and us earthlings are so backward were ignorant?5.NO WAY IN HELL WOULD A MODERN FILM STUDIO MAKE THIS FILM!WERE MINDLESS CATTLE AND FEED ON ACTION WITH GULPS OF POPCORN.5.Lastly,open your eyes.The world is a sad and beautiful place.A great film that's art.See it.	5.0	A  GREAT PIECE OF  ART!!!!	2004-04-10	4	4	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A22BPC7LRSGSYQ	Joker	For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this movie...2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a trailblazing science fiction movie that is visual storytelling at its finest.  There isn't a whole lot of dialogue throughout the movie, but its the images that tell the story.  My favorite part of the movie is the first 10 minutes or so, which shows apes in prehistoric times.  The movie has some boring parts that drag, but overall the movie manages to hold one's attention (should, anyway).  The special effects are good for 1968.  Some of the sets and images look fake, but they still manage to get the job done.  This movie paved the way for later science fiction movies that had more advanced special effects and it greatly influenced a lot of directors of science fiction movies in the years after its release.  The soundtrack is classic.Highly recommended.	5.0	Influential and trailblazing	2014-06-29	1	1	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3F9VH8916IA40	Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...	"2001; a Space Odyssey is a movie that has been on my to see list just about forever. I've always intended to watch it... one of these days, but other films kept pushing it back just a little bit. Finally, I put my foot down and just said ""you know what? That's it, I'm going to see 2001 even if it kills me!"" well, it didn't kill me; I rather enjoyed it really and am very glad I finally decided to see it.Okay, on to the film. Obviously, this is a classic. it's just one of those films that you HAVE to watch if you're a movie fan, regardless of if you like it or not. You can absolutely despise space movies, or classical music, or super computers, but that's all irrelevant. The simple fact of the matter is that this film is too highly regarded by the film world to pass up on, and I can see a lot of the reasons why. For one thing, this movie probably has the best cinematography I've ever seen. Almost every shot it masterfully crafted provoking just the right emotions that are desired. Mixed with the incredibly fitting classical score, this movie has some of the best visual scenes I have ever seen. The creators of this film new exactly what they were doing in that regard. HAL is one of the greatest sci-fi ""villains"" (I put that in quotations because he really isn't a villain per say, just a very human like computer acting in its self interest) of all time. His calm, calculating voice is great in and of itself, but what makes ""him"" so alarming is his very human like traits. he fears, takes pride in his work, enjoys playing chess with the crew of the ship, etc. give him a body and a voice that can change pitches and he'll be just like you and I, only a lot smarter.The basic story really isn't that interesting. It starts with a fifteen minute opening staring, ah, big hairy monkeys. Yes, I was just as surprise as you are. i had NO idea that there were any monkeys in this movie, so when the first thing I see is an ape I had to take the disk out to see it I got the right movie. anyway, these apes find an alien stone (one assumes its alien) then shortly thereafter learn how to use bones and other objects as weapons to fight off rival monkey gangs who want to steal their water. It's a very interesting opening for a ""space odyssey"" to say the least, but I rather liked it. Don't know why it had to be so long, but I'm still glad it was there. After this the story centers around a mysterious discovery on the moon, and a mission sent to Jupiter that results. The space ship they use to get to Jupiter, I can't remember its name right now, although unrealistic, is actually a nice piece of work that rivals just about any ship from any sci-fi movie I've ever seen. On the way to Jupiter HAL supposedly makes a mistake and the crew discuss disconecting him, which obviously he doesn't take very well. Acting upon his self interest he decides that the only way to save himself is to eliminate the crew members planning to ""kill"" him, setting up one of the great confrontations in sci-fi history.It is also great to see someone who actually got a lot of his facts right in regards to space and space travel. Granted, he did get the date (2001) wrong and his ships were WAY too big but for the most part his vision of the future seems to be right on the money. There isn't any sound in space which he got right; you have to spin your ship to produce gravity, which he also got right. They also got the way we would land on the moon mostly right. Considering when this film was made, I'd say it's a remarkable accomplishment that they were correct in so many ways.There is no doubt that this is a classic. However, I cannot in god faith give a movie that made me fall asleep twice any more than four stars. I've already admitted that this is a really good film, but despite all that, it is still very boring. I know what you're going to say, I don't get it, I'm just a dumb teenager who gets bored if I don't see action/sex/car chases etc every five minutes, and if that's what you think there's no way to convince you otherwise so I won't bother. I rarely fall asleep during a film, even one I hate, and when I do I normally go straight to Amazon to write a bloody disgusting review. I didn't do that for this film because I understand what they were trying to do and think that they succeed for the most part in pulling it off, but there is long segments in this film where nothing actually happens. The first five minutes of the film is a black screen, no kidding. I thought my TV was broken, but it wasn't the TV, it was the movie. Also, every little thing is played out in minute detail. They have to fix the antenna, so what do they do? Film ten minutes of a repair ship flying out and, well, fixing it. Nothing really happens, he just fixes it. Face it fans, although this movie is artistically great, it IS boring as hell.Another problem I found with this film is that HAL, the computer, often acted more human than the crew itself. The characters were very bland, having little or no depth or personality. Their reactions seemed very inhuman at times. What happens when one of them gets sucked into space? The other calmly, as if nothing happened, strolls to the rescue ship and, very slowly, tries to recover the body. it's almost as if the filmmaker really didn't care a whole lot about their characters and wanted to show as little of them as they could get away with. When a computer acts more human than your cast, that's when you know you have a problem.As for the ending, I'm not even going to pretend I understand it. If someone could tell what on earth was going on, then that would be great. The last ten to fifteen minutes is just WTF! Moment after another. I know something is going on, but no matter how hard I try to figure it out the answerer eludes me. The final scene was very powerful and almost poetic, with the musical theme of the movie blaring in the background, and ties in perfectly with the beginning of the film.Overall I'm not going to say it's one of the best films I've ever seen, but it's certainly a visual achievement and must see for any movie buff. Although it could have vastly benefited from using the rule ""less is more"" and better acting, it's still an amazing achievement. 4 and a half stars.Re-watch value; Depends, if you want action very low, if you want meaningfull, the high."	4.0	A classical music video in space.	2008-02-14	3	2	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A33AVTV7KKW4SJ	Jonathan Walker	I visually really injoyed this Motion picture, and it was really well done in my books. Some of the parts were really confusing in the storyline and I had a really hard time in trying to understand some of the scenes and storylines in the movie. For example, the last scene that appeared in the movie, when the monolith appeared in front of the space shuttle and made the astronaut David Bowman(Keir Dullea)appear in what looked like a bedroom. It really got confusing to view and to understand the ending part of the movie. And I also don't understand what that baby star is supposed to be. I was thinking that form was part of the monolith in some kind of way. I still go around asking people if they have seen the movie, and if they did, I would ask them if they understand it and to explain to me what happend.But, altogether it's a pretty good entertaining SCI-FI movie.

This film was written AS PART OF the book, by Arthur C. Clarke AND Stanley Kubrick.  They intended this film to confuse the audience so much, that it would interest people into reading the novel, so they could find out what it all meant.  Pretty sneaky?  Yup, but it's also an artistic triumph.  Remember that this film was released before we landed on the moon in reality.  I love this movie, even though it does sometimes put me to sleep too.I hope that all of you who were confused by the film will pick up the book and see if it doesn't help a bit.  The themes and ideas that Clarke and Kubrick were trying to deal with were almost too huge to even consider making a film that had a running time of less than twelve hours. so they opted to dazzle with an artistic rendering of an almost asceticly stoic nature and let the wonder wash over the audience like a wave.  Is it beautiful?  Yes.  Is it easy to understand?  No.  Is it worth a second look?  Only you can decide.  Good viewing!	5.0	Film as first chapter.	2007-10-09	7	3	4

The special effects are still good, the music was immortal, the characterizations great... but what will always get me is the way it was not just entertainment, it was art. Who can forget the swirling colors of Jupiter and Beyond? or the plunge into fantasy scapes reminiscent of Salvador Dali and our own dreams? And let's not forget the Toilet scene- every Stanley Kubric movie has a toilet scene, and this one has a kind of tounge in cheek quiet hilarity (set against immortal classical music) that is really, truly wonderful- but not only does it not detract from the movie, it adds a sence of mortality to space travel that creates a whole different level of the movie! if i can rave like this about a toilet, then you have to see it.	5.0	unbelieveable...

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3U5KW4Q339SKD	Joseph Kulakowski	If your idea of entertainment is lots of explosions, car chases, and other various forms of mindless entertainment don't get this movie.Now on to the review.  Though the movie can be a bit long at times the intended effect is to sort of educate the reader the realities of space exploration.  For example, there is a scene where a lunar vehicle lands on the moon.  The whole scene from approach to finally landing on the pad takes several minutes.  You don't see that on Star Trek.Even in the space vehicle that is heading to Jupiter there are two astronauts who spend most of their time running around and playing games trying to kill time.  You can't get much more realistic than this.  You don't see space people in cheesy space suits zooming around at warp speed and running into aliens that speak the same language.Plus there is a good message in this film but you will have to watch it in order to see what it is.  (I don't want to spoil the movie for you)So if you want a serious and intelligent film with emphasis on reality this is a good pick.	5.0	Wow - but not for everyone	2002-08-20	9	7	2

I'll just say that ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is an astonishing film, and will especially resonate with those who respond to awe, wonder, and mystery in their movies.  But it's not all mystery and ultimate questions.  The tense little section featuring the Hal 9000 computer delivers a jolt of mainstream movie conflict for those who like a little grounding with their metaphysics.And, hey, I have to say I was proud of myself several years ago when seeing the film for the second or third time.  Before I read it anywhere else, I noticed the strange occurrence of characters wishing other characters happy birthday a couple of times throughout the movie, which of course are cleverly-placed signposts and underscores to the ultimate birthday at film's end. In fact, I'm not sure if I've ever read of anyone else pointing out those ""happy birthday"" moments as an early revelation of theme, though I'm sure someone has.My DVD of ""2001"" (which I pulled out the other day and watched on a whim) is a few years old and only features the film's trailer as a special feature.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A34D06JL7LC6MU	"Joshua Miller ""Josh"""	"Since 1968, the year of its release, Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey has continually found its way onto lists of the greatest films ever made and is generally considered to be his masterpiece. In 1991, it was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry, a 2002 Sight & Sound poll ranked it among the ten best films of all time, and in 2010 The Moving Arts Film Journal named it as the greatest film ever made. Upon its release, it received polarizing reviews (you'll notice a pattern here when it comes to Kubrick films), but scored four Oscar nominations of which it won a single one: Best Visual Effects. Even those turned off by the slow pacing and confusing plot could not ignore the stunning achievement in that area. This film is almost 44 years old and its visual effects have not aged in the slightest, at a time when films only a year old can appear dated. Kubrick and science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke collaborated on the screenplay, while Clarke worked on the novel simultaneously. Clarke's novelization presented a more linear story, while Kubrick held to his belief that the film should be ""basically a visual, nonverbal experience."" There is not a single line of dialogue for the first 25 minutes and the eventual dialogue is of little importance, ultimately. Even so, the film still manages to contain one of the most oft-quoted and famous lines in cinema history. I wonder if Kubrick ever looked at his career and just marveled over what he had accomplished.My first exposure to 2001: A Space Odyssey came at the age of 13 after being exposed to Kubrick and subsequently going on a binge of his work. After seeing all of his films that followed it, I went into it eagerly and came out underwhelmed. There were images I couldn't shake from my mind, but it failed to measure up to my own preconceived expectations. It wasn't until two years later when I would see it again. I was required to write a paper on it for a high school final and could have written it without watching it again. By claiming the need to see it again, I had the opportunity to be yanked out of other classes and watch it during school hours. This was every 15-year-old's dream. As I sat in that empty, darkened classroom for two and a half hours everything changed. Everything I had missed before suddenly became clear. 2001: A Space Odyssey is still not my favorite Kubrick film, but it is one of my favorite films and represents, for me, cinema in its purest form.There are nearly 3 minutes of black screen before the film begins with the title card ""The Dawn of Man."" Opening in the desert, a tribe of man-apes are shown in their daily ritual, foraging for food and fighting off the dangerous creatures around them. One morning they awake to find a black monolith has appeared. Soon after, one of the man-apes discovers that bones can be used as tools and weapons. The fact that the monolith could only have been created by a more intelligent life form seems to awaken this knowledge within their minds. The bone is thrown into the air and the film, iconically, jump cuts four million years to a nuclear device orbiting the Earth. In the following section of the film, Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) travels to the moon after a mysterious object is discovered. This, of course, leads to the most well-known section of the film depicting the Discovery One en route to Jupiter. On board are Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) and Dr. David Bowman (Keir Dullea), as well as three scientists in cryogenic hibernation and the spacecraft's supercomputer HAL-9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain). The film concludes with ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite,"" one of the most famous and puzzling finales of any American film.The visual effects (and there are many) are pure artistry, with many shots leaving you to marvel at how they were accomplished. The non-Outer Space sets are recognizably Kubrick, adding an otherworldly feel to the film as they're so uniquely part of the Kubrickian-canon. What is 2001: A Space Odyssey without the music accompanying it? Like most Kubrick, the music remains such an integral part of the film and is a big contributor to both its brilliance and mystique. It's impossible to separate the music from the scenes it accompanies; they are part of a single entity.Even watching a DVD copy of this film on a high-definition TV, it still looks stunning. Visually, there are few, if any, films that equal 2001: A Space Odyssey in sheer ingenuity. Modern films with their quick cuts and soulless action sequences can wear you down at times, but this film pulls you in with its images. It's not easy for a filmmaker to cast a spell over his audience by making a nearly silent film so long after the silent era ended, but Kubrick created one of the most slow-moving, yet gripping films to ever grace the screen. As a director, Kubrick was never considered to be preoccupied with emotion. Ironically, you'll find one of his most emotionally endearing scenes here with Hal's dying moments. Kubrick's films are often regarded as cold, yet this scene has a startling emotional impact. It makes you wonder how Spielberg's A.I. would have turned out with Kubrick at the helm.The presence of extraterrestrial life hangs over every event in the film. Kubrick and Clarke initially intended to have aliens appear onscreen, but ultimately decided against it. While extraterrestrials are not explicitly acknowledged until nearly two hours into the film, 2001: A Space Odyssey is home to some of the most memorable and frightening aliens ever depicted. The presence of these life forms hangs so heavily over the film that they leave a more substantial mark than any physical depiction possibly could have. The second time a monolith is discovered in the film is a prime example of this. This scene is more haunting than nearly any scene you could pull out of any violent alien-related movie, yet nothing is shown.The final 24 minutes are extravagant and brave. A testament to the command Kubrick had over this material. For much of it, you have no idea what you're looking at and yet...It's not an issue. It's so hypnotic, so elegant it doesn't matter. This leads to one of cinema's greatest endings; abstract, thought-provoking, endlessly fascinating, memorable in a way only Kubrick could have seen through.2001: A Space Odyssey asks more questions than it answers and its creators are aware of this. It's a film with mysteries as vast as the space it depicts. 100 years from now, this will still be a film that people watch, mouths agape. A film of such majesty that all filmmakers could benefit from aspiring to capture just a miniscule amount of the magic it contains. This is quite possibly the greatest science-fiction film ever made and is undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made in any genre.GRADE: A"	5.0	Cinema in its purest form	2006-08-07	0	0	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	ALW1636GEPC0J	"JP ""JP"""	"First let me say that there are some scenes in this movie that portray space travel in a way that is I think still unique in the film industry, refreshing and simply cool.  Sure, the wonders of the cutting edge graphics and the pioneering concepts in moviemaking at that time may have faded now.  But the fact that this movie was made in 1969, portraying an age of space travel now more than twelve years ago that never came to be.... adds a new weight and interest to this movie that more than compensates for it.  That part is simply fascinating.  Artistry aside, the imagery was well ahead of the time and amazingly, plenty good enough I believe to hold up to even today's standards.Now we get to the problems of this film, purely from my viewpoint that kept this keeper from being a favorite.  Sadly this movie from front to end lacked any sense of real storyline continuity.  Starting out with a string of unconnected characters, developing a rather weak, hard to follow plot which gained momentum in the middle..... then closing with probably one of the worst drugged out endings of any movie I've ever seen.  Honestly, and I don't think I've ever come across this before..... but I feel the last 30 minutes of this movie (post HAL) could probably have been cut entirely and I probably would have upped its stock value.  It didn't even make little sense to me, it made no sense.What a mix of spectacular and crappy.  The opening... for lack of a better word ""rubber suit sequence"" conceptually I think was excellent, but suffered a great deal from the films crude props.  The apes just were just not realistic either by look or mannerisms-- and you really just have to squint your eyes and dismiss, and try to imagine the authors take on how the scenes should have been.  Then we then get to some breathtaking imagery of the moon and spacecraft with excellently laid soundtracks, most memorable stuff-- yet you find yourself pretty far into the movie still searching around for something to latch on to plot wise, other than a rather sacerdotal singing black block.  You finally settle on crew taking a voyage to Jupiter made up of two rather flat characters, three people hibernating unconscious who die later (they could not have gotten good billing for their roles) and a really masterfully portrayed talking computer.  After a battle where both Dave and HAL prove pretty resourceful, we wind up with what appears to a be a psychological study on the cycle of life with reams and reams of colorbursts, film of the earth displayed in negative, some very creepy scenes of an old man in a hotel room and a rubber baby.As a vehicle for showcasing to people the mysteries of space travel and science, this movie does its job and well.  As a portrayal of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and a ponderance of the ethics and dangers of man vs computer this movie is a classic, even worth studying.  As an exercise of 1969 portraying 2001 in 2013, the movie holds great interest.  But this is largely an art film.  Take away these considerable merits, and you're left with a weak, disappointing C movie which leaves you wondering whether the director just gave up and fired the bong during the last half hour."	3.0	Great middle, weak beginning and awful ending........	2013-08-04	5	1	4

However, after genuine films of the Gemini and Apollo missions emerged, I realized how well Stanley Kubrick had simulated space flight, and space walking, in this movie.

Others say the best of all time. That, by me, is not quite correct. However, this remains one of the best of Kubrick and certainly one of the best sci-fi's of all time.There are excellent performances from a largely unknown cast - Keir Duella especially manages to impress in his magnificent lead role. The storyline is not what 2001 is now like, but hey, you can't help but stand up and cheer for Kubrick for such hard work into his accurate direction and scripting. HAL9000 is the real key to this movie though, he is probably one of the best movie villains ever, and although a computer-generated machine, is still a memorable 'character' in this extraodinary piece of art.2001: A Space Odyssey: A	5.0	Incredible!	2001-02-03	2	1	1

And then I saw a the classics Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot; and the discussion of this true epic, I realized that it's just the story of Odyssey, What Clark( and Kubrick of course) try to tell us is about the spirt of ancient intelligence which is beyind space and time that can be explained even in the future and the whole universe.The idea one about the greatness of &quot;life&quot; itself and idea two is that the end of the jouney of human evolution is just the &quot;begining&quot; of the trip of life.that's the what homer told us; a story of returning home of a trip.I think that Clark wants to send this message more scientific, by the great and detailed plot of the fiction; but Kubrick expressed the idea in  a way of literature, and more like the poem of the classical Odyssey.(Kubrick was always fastcinated in history stuff), what he did about classical music might  just fit the rhyme. maybe everyone knows this long ago, but I didn't know the story when I saw the movie first time.	5.0	The answer of this confusing puzzle is just on it's title	2002-06-14	1	1	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1QHYYND7Q7ZOE	Justin Lowry	&quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; may very well be the best science fiction film ever.  Near the beginning, the movie has one of the most memorable scenes in film history: the enlightening insight of an early  ape-like man who discovers the tool.  A couple of scenes later we see early  man find the tool's more destructive potential as a weapon.  A simple but  true statement on humanity's condition.  But it doesn't end there, the  movie continues to emphasize humanity's outward reaching mind.  A  multi-million year flash forward takes us from early man to space - another  frontier built upon insight and imagination.  In space we get the beautiful  &quot;Fantasia&quot;-like musical sequence that stands as one of my  favorite scenes of any movie, simultaneously showing the beauty and  peacefulness of space and the triumph and ingenuity of mankind.  From there  we get a good science fiction story that continues to hint at the loftiness  in the beginning of the movie while providing a connection to the audience.  Though the stargate sequence dates itself as being a product of the 60s,  the ending, even as incomprehensible as it is, further emphasizes the  outward reaching of humanity.&quot;2001&quot;, with the brilliant  direction of Stanley Kubrick, does not rush mindlessy along like many of  today's movies.  Instead, by keeping a slow pace and by having minimal  dialogue, the movie provides a mystical atmosphere to support its theme.  Even the most mundane scenes (like an astronaut doing exercise) are  directed with such masterly skill.  The special effects look great even  today.  Plus, the film contains hard science - it is the only outer space  movie I have seen that does not show sound in space.Truly a visual  masterpiece and an intelligent, thoughtful piece of science fiction.	5.0	A classic and a monument to the visual potential of film!	2000-06-28	3	3	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AJX0Q5B0QEP57	"Justin Ratcliff ""egovirus"""	Being among the few who appreciate the incredible craft involved in Stanley Kubrick's movie making, I will forever be a fan, and I am still amazed by the high quality of this groundbreaking film. One needs to put it in proper context, and realize that this film was released a year before humanity landed on the moon, and almost ten years before Star Wars was a cultural phenomena.One of the things that I really like about this movie is it's just about the best pieces of science fiction (with strong emphasis on science) I have ever seen. This has a lot to do with the strong story furnished courtesy of Arthu C. Clarke, who is in my opinion, probably the best sci-fi writer of all time. For instance, space-being a vacuum- does not allow sound. This is the only movie that I can think of that is bold enough to acknowledge this fact! The treatment of physics in this movie is one of its strengths, and what makes it such a fine sci-fi-fact film.For some, the lack of dialogue in this movie is a real turn off, and the ending (I'm not going to ruin it for those who want to see it) will leave some frustrated and/or confused. Reading the book sheds a lot of light on the meaning of the ending. Another big turn off for people is the length of the movie, and it is a rather long flick, especially when the finale seems pretty anti-climactic.This movie is probably best for sci-fi/Clarke/Kubrick fans, and those who are thinking of trying something new should honestly stay away. The long periods of silence, and the scenes coupled with the music of Strauss, will probably keep a lot of people snoozing. Needless to say this movie will not be appreciated by all, and that really is a shame.The DVD transfer is fantastic, and clean look and sound really adds life to this old film.	5.0	Stunning, even 34 years later	2002-07-23	2	2	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AFRZL05D54MPM	JWolf	"OVERVIEW:  The 1968 science-fiction thriller ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"" was produced, directed, and co-written by Stanley Kubric; Arthur C. Clarke also received co-writing credit for the film as it was inspired by his story ""The Sentinel.""  The screenplay centers around the interactions between humans and extraterrestrials, exploring the fantastical mysteries of technology, artificial intelligence, human evolution, and the elusive black monoliths.Following the 1964 release of ""Dr. Strangelove,"" Kubric set his sights on creating a science-fiction epic that would bridge man and universe.  Kubric's approach to the genre was considered non-typical for the time; rather than focus on ""monsters and sex,"" Kubric preferred to explore human vulnerability via man's journey into the unknown--a voyage reminiscent of Homer's ""Odyssey,"" and, thus, lending inspiration for the film's title.Even though this movie is a bit aged, it's one I believe every sci-fi fan should at least see if not own.  Not only is it marvelous in its predictions of the future, it's also a film that investigates the fundamental separation between man and computer.  In addition, ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"" has been referenced and parodied for decades, further demonstrating the importance this film retains in science fiction as it exists today.RECEPTION:  ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"" has received almost a half-century's worth of praise for its impeccable foresight, special effects, scientific accuracy, and minimalistic use of dialogue.  The film's original debut spawned mixed opinions from critics and audiences; however, over the years, the movie has become a cult-classic and noted among the most influential pictures of all time.  Today, ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"" retains a place in the National Film Registry and continues to bear influence on current film icons such as George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and Ridley Scott, among countless others.STARRING ROLES:  Danial Richter as Chief Man-Ape, Douglas Rain as voice of HAL 9000, William Sylvester as Dr. Heywood R. Floyd, Keir Dullea as Dr. David Bowman, Gary Lockwood as Dr. Frank Poole, Frank Miller as Mission Controller, Margaret Tyzack as Elena, Leonard Rossiter as Dr. Andrei Smyslov, Sean Sullivan as Dr. Roy Michaels, Edward Bishops as Lunar Shuttle Captain, Robert Beatty as Dr. Ralph Halvorsen, Edwina Carroll as Aries Stewardess, Heather Downham as Stewardess, Penny Brahms as Stewardess, Ann Gillis as Poole's Mother, and Alan Gifford as Poole's Father.VARIATIONS BETWEEN BOOK AND FILM:  Kubric, having selected Arthur C. Clarke as his source-material collaborator, chose the short story ""The Sentinel"" as the film's preliminary basis.  The process of transforming a short story into both a full-length novel and screenplay required years of research, brain-storming, and, of course, fantasizing.  Despite their intention to finish the novel first, Kubric and Clarke found that, when paying proper respect to each medium, variations between print and screen were inevitable.  In a nut-shell, the differences primarily exist in the degree of descriptions offered by book and film; the book explores phenomena more completely than the movie, as Kubric opted for a more cryptic and inexplicit method of detailing.DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:  (Released 3-29-11 / 1-disc / G-Rated / 148-min. Run-Time / ASIN:  B004L9GMBC)&#9642;  Languages:  English and Franais&#9642;  Subtitles:  English, Franais, and Espa&ntilde;ol (Bonus features excluded)&#9642;  Commentary by Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood&#9642;  Theatrical TrailerSUMMARY:  The film is partitioned into four major sections.(1)  ""The Dawn of Man"" (based on Arthur C. Clarke's short story of the same name)--After a leopard attacks a tribe of early herbivorous hominids, the group takes night's refuge in a rocky crater.  They awaken to the presence of a frightening black monolith.  The instinct of fear drives the Chief Man-Ape to improvise his resources; he turns a discarded bone into a weapon as a means of protection.  Upon success of the bone's use as a tool, the hominids become slaves to innovation as a means of survival in the competition between tribes.(2)  ""TMA-1"" [Fast-forward approximately 4-million years from Act I]--En route to Clavius Base, a U.S. outpost located on Earth's moon, Dr. Heywood R. Floyd stops for a layover on an Earth-orbiting space station (apparently, with the commercialization of space travel, Pan Am no longer offers direct flights).  On the space station, Floyd meets up with two colleague scientists, Elena and Smyslov, each of whom expresses concerned curiosity over the rumor of an epidemic on Clavius Base; Floyd declines to comment on the situation.Once he reaches the Lunar outpost, Floyd reiterates the confidential nature of the supposed `epidemic'--a cover for the mission which unearths a deliberately planted black monolith (dating back 4-million years).  The artifact-recovery team treats the finding of the ""Tycho Magnetic Anomaly One"" as an intriguing discovery, but is primarily ignorant of its importance... that is, until the TMA-1 begins to transmit a very strong and mysterious segment of radio signals....(3)  ""Jupiter Mission"" [18 months after Act II]--""Discovery One,"" a U.S. spacecraft piloted by Dr. David Bowman, Dr. Frank Poole, and the ship's artificially intelligent computer, the HAL 9000, is tasked to carry three cryogenically hibernated research scientists to Jupiter (presumably to investigate the source of the radio signals emitted by the black monolith found at Clavius Base).  Dave and Frank appear to be `in-the-dark' concerning the objective of the Jupiter Mission, but distract from their ignorance of the mission's specifications by speculating on the extent of HAL's A.I. abilities; HAL insists he is perfect and incapable of error.While discussing the nature of the mission with Bowman, HAL quickly redirects attention to a glitch he has detected to affect the ship's main antenna.  The astronauts determine that there is no malfunction with the part; their assessment is seconded when Mission Control reports that HAL's initial detection of `fault' was made in error.  HAL, insistent that his system is immaculate, demands the `faulty' part be reinstalled so that he may prove the ""human error"" via impending malfunction.As Dave and Frank grow weary of HAL's ""ego,"" they attempt to conceal their suspicions from HAL by holding conversation in one of the EVA pods--a place in which the ship's computer cannot detect sound.  The astronauts proceed to replace the `faulty' unit, as per HAL's recommendation, but agree that if HAL is found in error, he must be disconnected; unbenounced to Bowman and Poole, HAL can ""hear"" their scheme by reading lips.In the process of replacing the `malfunctioning' unit, HAL disengages the oxygen hose to Poole's EVA pod.  Bowman immediately sets out in the other pod to retrieve Poole, but during his absence, HAL terminates all life-support to the three cryogenically hibernated scientists.  HAL then refuses to permit Dave to reenter the ship, stating that his intention to disconnect HAL is contrary to the interests of the mission.Dave's ability to manually enter the ship via the emergency airlock represents the separation between man and computer.  As he makes his way into HAL's processor core, HAL attempts to defend his actions and change Bowman's mind by using psychology; HAL's pleas quickly turn from rational to emotional.  While disconnecting the processor modules, HAL's voice is continuously heard--signifying his descent into death.  Once the computer goes completely inert, a hidden video from Floyd comes on-screen, revealing the actual purpose of the Jupiter Mission:  after uncovering the Moon's mysterious black monolith, it emitted a single, powerful radio signal directed at Jupiter... but has since remained completely dormant.(4)  ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite""--Dave, the only member of ""Discovery One's"" crew to make it to Jupiter, rendezvous with another black monolith in orbit about the planet.  As he nears the monolith, he and his EVA pod are sucked into a `wormhole' of sorts that takes him on a high-speed journey through space and time.  [The movie's final sequence of events is far better seen than described; every individual will interpret the ending scene differently.]"	4.0	THE Science Fiction Classic	2013-10-22	3	2	1

If we'd had something resembling the cast of 2010, their emotional journey as a parallel to the external voyage would have made a much more satisfying film. A staple of epic filmmaking - and I don't consider it controversial to say that 2001 is considered an epic - is the protagonist. Why? Because in caring for the protagonist on a personal level, we come to care about humanity as a whole. The irony is that the only character who was developed - and about whom I found myself caring in any way - was the non-human HAL.I'm not going to dispute that this is one of the most beautifully-filmed movies of all time. The lighting, music, presentation, and effects are undoubtedly in a league of their own. I also won't dispute that it was influential in the way space sequences were depicted in film. But the truth is that you don't really see any films that follow 2001 in terms of storytelling. The one movie I can think of that comes close to an exception is Star Trek: The Motion Picture...and guess what people said about it:""...crippled by a plodding pace and a somber tone.""""...blandness raised to an epic scale.""""Nothing...moves above a glacial speed.""""like watching someone else watch television.""""[The actors were] limited to the exchanging of meaningful glances or staring intently at television monitors, usually in disbelief.""Why is it that people couldn't take this with ST:TMP (which, by the way, did raise philosophical issues of its own), but could with 2001?

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2JAHP26RCGG4C	Kari	This movie, in my opinion was dreadfully disappointing. Normally I don't read movie reviews, but I saw some for this one and decided it would be worth a try. It was awful. If you feel like your life is flashing before your eyes, watch this movie, it feels like an eternity. I rented it from Amazon Prime, just finished it a few minutes ago. I honestly had to fast-forward through a lot of it. I love quiet, slow paced, thought provoking movies, but this is just too much. 20 minutes of grunting primates. I thought I turned on the wrong movie. Some of the scenes are stunning, but it's just so boring and the characters are one dimensional. Parts of this score are absolutely dreadful. I'm baffled by what I just watched.	2.0	I don't understand the hype	2014-05-29	1	0	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1NEDWYBHY5AKH	Kate	This is a film I have seen twice on the big screen - the first time in Cinerama, as it was intended to be seen.  I have owned a video copy for at least 20 years, and watch it regularly.  Realizing that I needed a more permanent medium to store the movie, I finally purchased it on DVD, and am so glad that I did.  The two-disk set allows for a great deal of background material, and adds depth and breadth to the viewing experience.  It truly changed the genre of science fiction films, by using the medium to explore areas of the human brain and spirit in ways that few other films, of any type, have attempted, much less matched.	5.0	The film that changed science-fiction forever	2012-04-27	1	1	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2SEXPAN8UK8MX	K. Cormier	speaking specifically about the item and not the content of the movie itself, this is the widescreen edition and it does include the bonus DVD which has some nice bonus videos.  The video quality is good but considering the movie is from 1968, the coloring does look a little bit washed out, but nothing that would not make watching the movie enjoyable.As for the movie content, people either love or hate this movie, probably because Stanley Kubrick left it up to the viewer to answer some of the questions that arise in the movie.  It is up to each viewer to determine what they think.  I do recommend that anyone who views the movie and is a newcomer to Kubrick's movie also read the story that Aurthur C. Clark wrote in conjunction with the movie because it does not leave things so vague and mysterious.The movie has a slow pace to it so anyone expecting a Star Wars like experience is going to be disappointed but is one of the few science fiction movies to portray what the future of space travel and technology will be like, and this move is 44 years old.  Also one of the few movies to accurately show no sound coming from the space ships because there is no sound in the vacuum of space.	5.0	great movie, but you have to be a real Kubrick and Sci-fi fan to really love it.	2013-10-11	0	0	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A34D4KCP94ACJZ	K. Driscoll	When taken seriously there can be massive depth and cultural significance in commentary such as that which is present in 2001:  A Space Odyssey.  Moore's law of singularity and such warnings toward the speed of technology can provide for both fascinating science fiction and, if framed properly, alarming scientific reality.  But that is just part of what this film is trying tackle.  In the hands of the late great Stanley Kubrick (Dr. Strangelove,A Clockwork Orange), we get a visually stunning and remarkably thought-provoking cornerstone of American film.  2001:  A Space Odyssey is everything; it is science fiction, it is conflict, it is horror, it is suspense, it is existentialism, it could even be religion, and it is visually immaculate.  It's pace puts me in a trance every single time I see it and it forces me to watch like a tractor beam.It is based on the Arthur C. Clark novelof the same name.  Clark also helped Kubrick with the screenplay and went on to write three subsequent novels (2010: Odyssey Two,2061: Odyssey Three, and3001 The Final Odyssey) with just one turning into a subsequentfilm version.  The film comments on various themes, from evolution and manmade intelligence to extraterrestrial life.  As wonderful and thought-provoking as the story is, the film is also groundbreaking in terms of its special effects,  its general visual style and imagery, and its unique and unpredictable narrative.  Although those elements are Kubrick staples for sure, 2001:  A Space Odyssey stands out as quite possibly his greatest achievement and for my money within the top ten or even top five films of all-time.Different interpretations of this film exist in all pockets of all cultures.  They run the gamut from the film being too profound to explain in any message beyond Kubrick's creation, to Clarke's more detailed science fiction from the novel, to various allegorical explanations, and to it being some kind of scientific pondering of God and man's existence.  I pick up on new things every single time I see it and I wouldn't dare attempt to construct or impose my interpretation here but Kubrick's film is definitely worth letting it grip you tightly.Besides, no film shows us the depth of our creations while justifying our aprehension in creating them with more clarity, and I mean that both literally and visually.  If you are going to buy this film you may as well have it on the best format humans have created thus far.  Don't worry though, yourblu-ray playerorPlaystation 3won't attempt to kill you.  At least not yet.	5.0	I Sing the Body Electric	2008-07-11	5	3	2

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1VZLLDNLURGJB	Keith Mirenberg	"I agree with most fans and critics of this movie: It revolutionized science fiction and space cinema, it was too long and could at times drag, it had absolutely authentic special effects and was technically correct in all matters dealing with space science, what was that movie about?, it had a million credible and plausible interpretations, there wasn't enough dialogue and the actors walked through it, I loved it, I hated it, you have got to see it while stoned..... One could go on and on.There is no taking away from the fact that until 2001 we had no idea what could be done on the big screen to make science fiction movies authentic and moving.  It required the collaboration, combined vision and imagination of sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke and the film and visual genius of Stanley Kubrick to produce this outstanding cinematic production which has influenced science fiction film forever.Arthur Clarke wanted to portray the story explicitly and with more narrative, while Kubrick wished it to be an epic for the eyes and imagination with a minimum of chatter. We see who had greater influence on the final cut.  Clarke wrote sequels in accordance with his vision for 2001, and 2010 was the result.  I enjoyed both films ""for what they were worth"". Which of the two films do you like more?One final note on HAL, the Discovery's AI computer: Arthur Clarke was apparently a bit off in predicting when AI would become sufficiently advanced to synthesize human intelligence. I am not aware of any updates that Clarke may have made in this regard, but have heard that some experts say that as of the year 2001 we expect to achieve something like HAL in about 25 years, (circa 2020-2030).  This prediction is based on the projected number of computations per second that computers should be capable of, as well as some clever AI programming."	5.0	2001-Science Fiction Film Has Never Been the Same	2008-02-13	0	0	0

This movie was such a SNORE! The first thirty minutes were just animals howling, what gives? There wasn't any action either, and all the special effects looked horrible and outdated. It  would have been better with aliens, gunfighting, a love interest and gore. No one wants to watch a spaceship go slowly across the screen for five minutes, how boring and pretentious can this film be?

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2D9IEFJGB483Q	Kendal B. Hunter	This is the great crossover film that made it O.K. to like sci-fi.  Prior to this, sci-fi was limited to old Buck Rodgers serials, with the minimal to nonexistent budgets that made the special effects look like a middle school science project.  This film broke all of the rules.You know the story: a black monolith appears to a bunch of missing links, and when the planet align, they become intelligent and stat using tools.  Fast forward to a hypothetical 1999 where they discover a similar monolith in the crater Tyco (that is the bright one on the moons southern hemisphere, with a lot of splash lines from the impact), which sends a radio signal out to Jupiter.By 2001, the government hasn't released any information about the monolith or alien contact, notwithstanding the Freedom of Information Act.  They have, however, built a ship designed to make the journey to Jupiter to investigate.  We know the story: Hal goes crazy, and kills the crew, except Dave Bowman, with his Mona Lisa smile, who takes a pod into the monolith at Jupiter.  He goes thought the star gate, and experiences a cosmic LDS trip, and arrives in a neo-Rocco room where he ages, and eventually is brought to the next stage of human evolution via our good friend the monolith.This film tapes into the late 1960's excitement of the space program and the ever-enticing idea of human progress and potential.  Couple this energy with the spectacular cinematography and supra-standard special effects, and by all accounts this film is a winner.NOTE: There are two DVDs, one with the painting of the space station, which is the one I am reviewing, and another with Kier Duella's lovely mug, which I am not reviewing. This DVD is the re-mastered and restored DVD, with the film and soundtrack being upgraded from the other DVD.  The down side is that they have taken the interview of Art Clark fielding question from NASA team members before the movies released.  I am torked off that this was taken off of this DVD, since I am a fan of such things.  I recommend getting the other DVD if you like those things.By the way, if you don't like or don't understand this film, please do not take your frustration out on my reviewer rank or me.	5.0	This film paved the way for Star Wars!	2002-04-19	8	8	0

Being a huge Science fiction fan, I took it home, watched it, and nearly fell asleep half way through the movie.The movie is so boring. There are, literally, 10 minute scenes in the movie where people are doing nothing, yet it even gets worse. In the beginning and after the intermission of the movie there are nearly 5 minute cut scenes that show nothing but a black screen as some strange music plays in the back ground. I have to admit, I tried to to check the DVD a few times because I thought the movie was damaged. After watching the movie, I could not believe that such a movie could have such a huge cult following. The movie plainly sucked, end of story.On a Positive note, two good things the movie had going for it was its it's accuracy on the environment of space, and its visual affects. All the ships in the move made no noise as they traveled in space as where most science fiction movies get that wrong. Since space as no air, any noise in the void of space would give off no sound because the sound waves have no atmosphere to pressurize which allows them to travel. Also, SOME visual effects were beautiful. The one I found especially spectacular was when the ""Discovery"" reaches Jupiter, and there Jupiter sits with all its moons orbiting in the foreground and background. Anyone who has ever looked at Jupiter with a telescope would find this especially breath taking because that specific scene stays true to that vision of Jupiter; not obscuring it with any cheesy 1960's visual effects. Although its accurate portrayal of space and its visual effects are great, its not enough to carry a movie which should comprise of a consistent story line and character depth which this move truly lacks.To conclude, I would have given this move one star because it sucked so bad, but I decided to easy up and give two because of its accuracy of space and visual effects.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A356QJWDT3P62R	Keoma	"This movie has puzzled me as well as many others I have talked to about its ending, but now thanks to the interviews tacked on with this beautiful rendition of a sci-fi classic I can understand what Stanley Kubrick was trying to convey(although I won't reveal it here you'll have to get a copy yourself). This pristine blu-ray edition allows one to see every detail in a movie that demands detail such as the landing of the space craft on the moon port where you can see all the people moving around in the windows and other scenes. The colors and details When Keir Dullea's astronaut goes through his own odyssey via his alien hosts is spectacular in every way.Although I don't agree with the premise that man evolved from apes( I think it's as much fantasy as believing alien's helped man to evolve) it does not detract from my enjoyment of a well crafted film. I think this movie will stand out for generations to come for it's great production values. A film that was ahead of it's time in special effects and also for it's lack of sound effects from spaceship's (silence can be more dramatic than blasting sound effects when it is done right as in this film).

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1DHNC125851OZ	Kevin Alphonso	&quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; is a movie that can be sometimes difficult to put into words. I think the reason is mostly because it's a movie that speaks for itself. But, I'm glad to see a movie that remains  mostly ambiguious, letting the audience think of their own solutions and  wonder what the film is trying to say.Two astronauts, Dave Bowman (Keir  Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) are sent on a deep-space mission to  Jupiter for a reason that they do not know. The ship's onboard computer,  which helps them on their journey, is HAL (voiced by Douglas Rain), who  begins to act strangely and starts seriously malfunctioning.I can't  stress enough how great of a job that the film does in challenging your  mind. It starts off with apes in prehistoric Africa learning to survive and  ends with mankind evolving beyond his physical means in one of the most  beautiful and heavily debated endings in motion picture history.It took  several years for director Stanley Kubrick to fully realize this film  which, not only paved the way for smarter, deeper films, but showed us that  special effects can be convincing and important to the story.The effort  and time putting into making this film what it was is to be truly  commended.

It is a hybrid of the almost religious belief in science by Arthur C. Clarke, and the cinematic skill of Stanley Kubrick.  It is scrupulously factual for its time, and far ahead of its time in storyline.  Its special effects set a new bar, earning the film an Oscar, and not to be excelled until George Lucas' Star Wars in 1977.No science fiction movie has yet matched &#34;2001&#34; for its story and vision.  Although the special effects are a little dated and limited the almost unlimited imagination of Clarke and Kubrick, this movie still has no peer.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A28RXIMQLBZ6WX	Kevin from Atlanta	I first saw 2001: A space Odyssey in second run when I was 7 years old, and I hated it. For most kids it is long, boring, and confusing (and for most adults as well). A few years later I read the book by Arthur C. Clarke, which was based on the movie, not the other way around (although the movie was based loosely on an earlier Clarke short story; confusing, isn't it?). Not long after I saw the film again, and this time I recognized it for what it was (and is)-the best science-fiction film ever made. In some ways it is one of only a handful of true science-fiction films in existence. By science-fiction I mean a movie that truly builds from scientific theory and technology and extrapolates them in a realistic, meaningful way into the future (and the past as well, in this film). If science-fiction means space opera to you, if Star Wars and the like are the only science-fiction you are interested in, 2001 is not for you. You will not find lasers, nor faster-than-light space travel, cute androids, sounds in outer space, roguish pilots-none of that. What you will find is a film that meticulously sticks to the laws of physics and spacecraft designs that build logically from 1968 technology. You will also find special effects done the old fashioned way, with models, but that still hold up perfectly fine going on 40 years later.All that being said, there are two approaches you can take to the actual story: you can be a film purist, watch the movie and base your understanding (or lack thereof) and enjoymnent entirely on what you see on the screen, or you can read the book. The book is incredible in its own right, clearly one of the best science-fiction novels ever written. It does clear up a lot of the mysteries of the film, which for some people may not be a good thing. I can understand that. Personally the book added greatly to my enjoyment of the film, and having some understanding of what is happening on the screen during the more confusing parts (even if the interpretation is that of Arthur C. Clarke, not Kubrick) allowed me to let myself sink into the film with the feeling that, yes, this is confusing, but I have a good idea of what it all means. I have now read the book and seen the film serveral times each, and on each reading and viewing I get more out of both of them. My personal recommendation is to do the following: see the film, and whether you like it or hate it, read the book and watch the film again. If you hated the film on the first viewing I can almost guarantee that your opinion will have changed after reading the book. And then, even for those of you who think the film is overrated or don't get what the big deal is, I think you will get it. I know I did.	5.0	Best Science fiction movie ever, but please read the book.	2007-10-24	3	2	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1GFIU8RI1QAEL	Kevin Grierson	I watched this movie, shortly after reading the book that was written by Arthur Clarke in conjunction with the screenplay.  I can see how this would have been a knockout for the 1960's--the special effects were amazing for the time, and the stately pace of the spaceships set to classical music recalls some of the ballets from Walt Disney's &#34;Fantasia.&#34;  Today, however, the special effects are nothing special, and there are endless minutes of shots of spaceships set to the aforementioned classical music where nothing really happens for minutes on end.  The final 30 minutes or so of the movie is pretty much devoid of dialog altogether, and it's heavy slogging if you're used to movies with a more modern sense of pacing.  The book explained a great deal more of the concept behind the film and was much more thought provoking.	2.0	Probably great for its time, but almost unwatchable today	2013-10-27	9	1	8

Even though this is my favorite sci-fi movie, I wondered if just watching it on DVD again would be okay for me, knowing it was also available in high definition.  The other reviews that suggested Blu-Ray was great for this movie convinced me, so I bought the Blu-Ray.  Wow!  It was like watching it all over again for the first time, and to me, the special effects looked just about as good as some sci-fi movies made today - and much, much better than the contemporary Trek TV show of the late 60's, that's for sure (and I'm a big Trekker, too).  I was almost shocked to see how good it looked in Blu-Ray - well worth the money, even if you've owned it on VHS and DVD and seen it a bunch of times like I have.	5.0	Jumpin' Jupiter!  2001 is FABULOUS in Blu-Ray!	2010-11-09	5	5	0

There was Jackie Kennedy, then there were the astronauts, a group of highly trained men we all fell for, and I think Kubrick must have too, for he bases his astronaut heroes on the media representations of the original ""Mercury Seven"" US astronauts, wed to the plot of Arthur C. Clarke's story ""The Sentinel,"" so that there would be a twist and the astronauts would seem soulful compared to the flat significations of HAL their pet computer.I assume that's why Kubrick selected some fairly colorless US actors to play their parts, although who knows, at the time Keir Dullea was regarded as a deep well of tangled and tragic emotions after starring in DAVID AND LISA and BUNNY LAKE IS MISSING, but Gary Lockwood had nothing on his resume that would indicate any depth whatsoever, beyond his marriage to Stefanie Powers.  Also in the cast, as Lockwood's mother, the swan song of wonderful Ann Gillis, once little Becky Thatcher in Selznick's version of TOM SAWYER, and also the voice of Faline, Bambi's love interest.  She hadn't made a film in decades when Kubrick found her and cast her in this small but crucial role.  She was the original LITTLE ORPHAN ANNIE (1938) and her eternal sunny optimism is used ironically in the film.  (Kubrick wanted the original Depression optimist, Shirley Temple, but her agents said no way was Temple going to re-locate for the required London filming.)That said, the acting in 2001 is terribly underrated, and the movie should have been nominated for Oscars in several acting categories.  MGM built on the tech savvy of FORBIDDEN PLANET, with its similar mix of electronic music, beefcake spacemen, and uppity robot voices, and came out a winner all around.  Kubrick had worked with MGM before (on LOLITA), though Dr. STRANGELOVE was for Columbia.  After 2001, Kubrick made a longterm pact with Warner Brothers which lasted until his death, but even though some love the photography of BARRY LYNDON I don't think he was ever able to match the tech credits of 2001 ever again.  (In fact some of his later pictures look very studio-bound and TVlike.)"	5.0	Mercury Rising	2008-09-26	4	3	1

This film has some cutting edge special effects - for 1968. Sparse on dialogue and long on visuals, with an interesting juxtaposition of classical music and futuristic sets, it has all the makings of a great movie.However, after just seeing it yet again, I really only enjoyed the middle portion, in and around the USS Discovery. The ""dawn of man sequence"" was OK, and yeah, the cut to the spaceship was like groovy, man, but extended docking and spaceship movements seemed drawn out for their own sake. I liked the mechanics of the stewardess getting around. HAL is awesome, and chilling.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	2001: A Space Odyssey is a piece of cinematic art that projects human evolution in a sublime manner that enchants the audience with cinematographic magic.  The film begins with the beginning of man, where a group of primates has claimed an area that provides water and food for them.  This area is being fought over with a different group of primates that arrives to the area, but the current inhabitants stand strong and protect it.  One morning when these primates wake up they find a black, smooth monolith being set in their ground.  Soon after the discovery of the monolith, the primates discover the use of tools and how tools can be used as weapons.  As a result, the primates become carnivores and later learn a lesson in war.  This brings the audience to the future where humans still divided themselves over lands and rather than war, humans exercise tactful diplomacy.  Similar to what happened in the beginning of man, the American's have found a monolith that generates some odd, but strong energy.  Consequently, a mission to Jupiter is possible where the majority of the crew is put into a cryogenic sleep where they are closely monitored by two crew members and a super computer with human intellect, but without the human error, called HAL.  Soon it seems like something is about to go wrong when HAL reports an upcoming malfunction of the communication system.  2001: A Space Odyssey forces cerebral activity, as art does when viewed through multiple perspectives, and this provides an opportunity for the audience to make what they want out of the film.  However, the film is developed with direct intention by Kubrick, causing the audience to ponder the outcome of the film.  This is the true gem of the film.  At the end, the audience is left with an outmost brilliant cinematic experience that is like no other which exists.	5.0	Historical, Futuristic, Cinematic Art...	2003-02-05	1	1	0

If a viewer comes here seeking ""Star Trek: The First Generation"" that viewer will be profoundly disappointed. And the special effects seem a little dated now, though for 1968 they were literally beyond the cutting edge.2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is cinema. It engages and enraptures the viewer, inviting thought about where we came from and where we are going, and what the limits of the human mind are. If any.The ubiquitous computer HAL 9000 is more emotionally revealing than the humans, if rather more omnipotent, and is ultimately less logical and accepting of the unknown than his human counterparts. But we humans, despite our frailties, manage to evolve throughout the picture, whereas our technologies become more and more obsolescent, and effectively meaningless.2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is a heavy-handed metaphysical voyage, but one worth taking, and one which, it is to be hoped, we can't avoid but taking."	5.0	"""2001"" has come and gone..."	2002-03-21	2	1	1

It's surprising that with all the modern tools at their disposal Sci-Fi filmmakers still haven't bothered to read Physics 101 and make something even remotely plausible.Imagine what 2001 would have looked like if it were made today.

The truth is, this is storytelling at its finest, from the dawn of man to beyond the infinite.  The best part about this movie is that Kubrick does not try to cram one theme or meaning down the viewer's throat.  He is ambiguous for a reason, he even admits that the viewers can interpret what they wish from the story.  So watch this film with an open mind, ignoring the negative critics.Anyone who has ever seen a Kubrick movie and enjoyed it (The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut...) should rent 2001.  I can almost guarantee that you will be owning it shortly there after.	5.0	Greatest Film Ever	2002-07-01	6	3	3

Johnson	All my life I heard about that great science fiction classic - 2001: A Space Odyssey, and I finally decided that it was time to give it a try. So, dragging my teenage son along with me I put the DVD in the player and gave it a watch.On the plus side, the movie is visually stunning with many great scenes of space and spaceships that still impress some forty years later! The soundtrack is quite interesting, with an interesting mix of classical pieces and vocal pieces that put you on the edge of your seat.On the minus side, the movie moves with a glacial slowness. By the time the intermission drifted around, my son was so bored that he got up and went to watch television. I stuck with it, and was rewarded with a second half that was worse that the first. In general the second half made me think of a bad acid trip, of the sort that interested 1960s viewers, but nobody afterward. And, to make matters worse, it was an acid trip in slow-motion.At the end of the movie, I felt terribly disappointed. I am a huge science fiction fan, and yet I found the movie to be ambiguous to the point of irrelevance, leaving me with no positive feelings whatsoever. So, let me just say that while the movie is visually stunning it is murderously slow and uninterestingly ambiguous. I feel like I wasted two good hours on this movie, and I will definitely not watch it again.	2.0	Visually stunning, but murderously slow!	2013-09-05	7	2	5

As a family, we all found the experience overwhelming and talked about it for weeks.  My mom dragged us to see it several times that year, and all those repeated viewings did was to stimulate more conversation and reflection.  Coming back to the film over 35 years later, I'm still awe-struck by the majesty of this film.  Kubrick managed to fashion a literary and visual metaphor that captured, for me at least, the metaphysical freedom and zeitgeist of possibility of that visionary era in a way that transcended the merely personal to something much, much larger.  He hints at destiny here more convincingly than organized religions.If you haven't seen the film, be warned!  It is unlike any other in its genre and should not be compared to them.  You will need to approach it as if you were going to view a major Rodin sculpture, or Picasso's Guernica.  It is certainly a great work of art, in that he successfully draws you into an encounter with his vision and then leaves you to experience it yourself.  If anybody finds it slow, that's why.  If you become bored while watching it, I suggest that you left yourself at the door.  His control of every single element of the film is staggering, and yet seems perfectly natural.  Most notably, the combination of music and editing is perfection itself, a landmark that has never really been equaled.  Some people complain that the visuals look dated, but I don't see that.  I like Fra Angelica and Goya as well, and they don't look dated to me at all.  I've heard that Spielberg made his idea of space both more human and intellectual after seeing 2001; he hoped that people would actually meet a Wookie once they get out there.  Yet I suspect that, if we do meet anyone out there in the great emptiness, they will be much more like Kubrick's idea than the other.	5.0	A Masterpiece	2006-06-22	7	7	0

There are many points that remain unclear here, so the movie is only for those able to deal with the ambiguity. The aliens who set up the mysterious black column on earth appear to have influenced humankind in its development since the early days of our existence, but we never find out anything about these apparent benefactors. The same is true when Dave the astronaut seemingly is transformed into the Star Child after his consciousness-changing (?) experience in the alien wormhole. Was advanced consciousness given to us by these unseen beings or did we somehow earn it through our own actions? The answers are unclear, but Kubrick excites our senses along the way with some of the most stunning and beautiful footage (and music) found in a sci-fi epic.

Life for our distant ancestors is slowly presented and their salvation from extinction by a never seen alien species whose only visible sign is the black monolith.  When the bone is thrown into the air and the satellites appear orbiting the earth, it isn't said but those are actually supposed orbiting nuclear platforms.  Originally to have an Alex North score, Kubrick opted instead for classical music.

His films are void of cliches, strong to the point of the story, intelligent in every detail, correct in technical facts. Every time Spielberg puts out a have-it-all bleeding-heart  soap thing - I go to Kubrick for another view of 2001, Clockwork Orange,  Full metal jacket, Barry Lyndon ... and 2001 is the masterpiece of  masterpieces.	5.0	The masterpiece of masterpieces	1998-11-29	0	0	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A7ZZQOOYO5L34	Libris Vermis	"Opinions on 2001 are now pretty much cast in stone, at least for those of us ""of a certain age,"" so I'm not going to enter the fray, but for those younger cats who may not have experienced it I offer a few random personal recollections & reflections:I was 16 when it came out. I recall that my entire family went over to Traverse City (MI) one Friday night to see it - I don't think any film would create that much buzz again until Star Wars.  My dad was incensed - ""Not one word for almost 30 minutes, and no discernable story; what the hell kind of film is that?!""  But I felt like a softly struck gong; I seemed to float a few inches above the slush and ice all the way back to the car.Dad was a H.S. english teacher and I've noted with some interest over the years that writers seem to have the biggest problem with 2001.  It's not that it doesn't have a story, but that the story is told almost entirely in visual terms - it doesn't have much dialog because it doesn't need much dialog.  Is it because writers feel threatened by this approach, or that they just don't get it?  At any rate, I have found only a few commenters in the last 40-odd years that noticed how revolutionary 2001 was in this respect - that it firmly decoupled itself from the live theater paradigm that had dominated cinema to that point.But I have read several commenters that wrongly deride 2001 as being psuedo-intellectual.  Aside from the speculation that human evolution was given a nudge a few million years ago, 2001 is not any kind of intellectual.  Arthur C. Clarke remarked after it opened that MGM had just spent $10,000,000.00 on a religious film.The State Theater was a good theater for its day, but George Lucas's Dolby THX better-sound-in-movies initiative was still about 8 years in the future, so the very important music soundtrack was horrible.  Audiences didn't know any better at the time, but Gyorgy Ligeti, the composer of Requiem (screaming monolith), Lux Aeterna (shuttle ride to the monolith site), and Atmospheres (the star gate and beyond) knew what his music was supposed to sound like and sued MGM, not for using it without permission (or paying royalties), but for distorting his music! (he won, and got a nice royalty settlement to boot)For my money, the pas de deux docking sequence (or barnyard mating dance - take your pick) between the Pan-Am shuttle craft & the space station - accompanied by The Blue Danube Waltz, sans dialogue! - is about the most beautiful 12 minutes ever committed to film and needs no other justification.The Star Gate & Beyond sequence is also in my top-ten most beautiful film sequences ever, and demonstrates once again that Art is Art, independent of technique & tools.  I saw 2001 in a theater several years ago for the first time in almost 40 years & was much gratified at how well this sequence has held up, given the simple special effects tools Kubrick had to work with.  2001 was a big draw for campus film societies in the early '70s, and the de-rigueur way to see it was to eat a magic brownie or two just before so you'd be at peak elevation right at that closing light show (this tip originally came from an iconic book of the era, A Child's Garden of Grass).Finally, if you want a really in-depth analysis of this enigmatic masterpiece, get a copy of Arthur C. Clarke's The Lost Worlds of 2001, which contains an essay by then-16-year-old Anna Clark.  She had sent her essay to Kubrick, who responded that it was the most intelligent review that he had read, and passed it along to Clarke.Happy Viewing!"	5.0	Religious Experience	2011-03-13	3	3	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2IWFWYMOMAOEP	LindaC	"After this movie there was no need for ANY space movies or science fiction, this said all that could possibly be said.In a nutshell, the theme of this movie is:  Ape to man, man to spirit being.  That's it, it's about evolution (which I personally don't believe in, but this is science fiction).  It took me several viewings to actually get it, but that's what it's about.  If you watch the movie with this ""nutshell"" in mind, everything falls into place.  I saw the movie when it came out in the sixties.  You HAD to see it large-huge screen, in a movie theater, and not on a tiny multiplex screen.  So watching it on a TV is not going to have anywhere near the same impact.  In the theater with a Cineramic screen, you'd watch the space ship on the left side of the screen, then you'd see the pod, with your peripheral vision, come in off the right side, with the accompanying sounds following in the right speakers, like you were actually there. And the space-ride to Jupiter near the end just looks stupid on small screen, but majestic and awesome on the big screen.  So that is why I did not give 5 stars to the DVD, although the movie itself should get more than 5 stars.  Plus I am still mad that the owners of ""2001"" did not re-release it into movie theaters in the year 2001, which would have made a lot of sense.  Oh well.The deepest, most thrilling and awe-inspiring scene of ANY movie is:  when the ape throws the bone up into the air; he is on the brink of starting to actually think, and all of a sudden you are in the 21st century when the bone comes down morphed into a space ship.  The point is, you have to think about all that happened on the earth and the ""evolution of ape to modern man"" in untold eons that was encapsulated in only TWO FRAMES!  WOW!!When I first saw the movie, most of the audience (including me) did not get it, we knew we saw something but literally did not know what we had seen, it was just so different. The genius of Stanley Kubrick is, every single scene in that movie is planned by him and included for a reason.  If you quit paying attention to it at all (go to the bathroom, open up a candy bar, talk to your companion) and missed a scene or any of the dialogue, you miss a LOT and maybe all of it.  It takes an attention span.  It was said at the time that children understood it better than adults.  Even John Lennon went to see it multiple times, he was so fascinated by it.Hope that helps!"	4.0	GREATEST AND FINAL SCIENCE FICTION EVER	2004-12-10	11	9	2
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A17FLA8HQOFVIG	Linda Linguvic	I didn't see this film when it first opened in 1968.  In those years I didn't get to movies much.  And VCRs hadn't been invented yet.  But the film was groundbreaking, and of course I heard about it.  And through the years I've seen excerpts, but never the real thing.  Now it's the year 2003, and the year 2001 has already passed.  But as I soon discovered while viewing the film is that it's not about future scientific discovery; it's about a state of mind, a philosophical statement about man's place in the universe.It starts with apes finding a monolith, then picking up some bones and using them as tools to kill.  The scene then shifts far into the future and we see a space capsule with some supposed high-tech features.  There's a special mission, which is never clear.  And a computer named Hal, which starts to act like a human being.  Eventually, the lone surviving astronaut reaches Jupiter, goes though an aging process and gets reborn as a baby.  All of this takes 139 minutes to tell.  There's very little dialogue, just a lot of classical music.  The special effects are so good that they won the film's only academy award that year.  And the director, Stanley Kubrick, will be remembered as a genius.  The film is his personal view of the world...Personally, I found the film just plain boring.  There's a limit on how long I can sit and watch special effects.  Most of the time I spent wondering exactly what it all meant.  And when I discovered early on that it didn't mean anything, I just didn't care.  I really wanted to like this film.  After all it is classic.  And I definitely hoped the DVD would have some special features explaining its making.  Sadly, though, there is not one bit of commentary.  The film has to be judged completely on its own.I'm a film buff and so I'm glad I saw it just for the experience.  But I didn't like it at all.  And can't recommend it.	2.0	Boring, but the special effects are terrific	2003-01-11	41	15	26
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3BXS0A7CMJ1CJ	linus	"Arthur C. Clarke's story &quot;The Sentinel&quot; was the launchpad for this groundbreaking, bewildering sci-fi epic,  the first of its genre to demand serious artistic appraisal. Superficially, it's about a small crew  of astronauts going where no man has gone before and getting sabotaged by  their spiteful computer, HAL 9000. But what about the deeper levels? What  does it mean? What's the deal with the monolith, the star child, the ape  prologue, the weird ending with Victorian furnishings? Some have said the  monolith is a radio transmitter placed there by aliens monitoring the  progress of mankind; others insist it symbolizes an indifferent god.This  is the movie that made Kubrick's rep as a mysterioso genius; it came at  just the right time, and it was popular among those partial to  hallucinogens. Me, I think it's the greatest boring movie ever made - so  arrogantly static as to fixate your attention and enthrall you even when  literally nothing of interest is happening (I think of those endless  conference scenes aboard the space station). Cumulatively, it has an impact  unmatched by any other science-fiction film except maybe ""Metropolis,"" yet  it plays better in memory. I recognize its greatness, but it's not a movie  I can watch over and over; it's only two minutes longer than ""A Clockwork  Orange,"" but feels a whole lot longer. Purists whined about Peter Hyams'  sequel, but I didn't mind it for what it was; the actors were certainly a  livelier bunch."	4.0	Probably best seen in a theater	2000-07-28	6	2	4

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3V6Z4RCDGRC44	"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t..."	"2001 is a melding of two great minds - director Stanley Kubrick and great sci-fi author Arthur C. Clark. Based on Clark's short story ""The Sentinel"", the pair were not out to make a guns-blazing, alien-slaying movie like the popular Star Trek series. Instead, they were going in a completely different direction - exploring what makes a human a human, and how what we think and do defines us as intelligent creatures.The result is a very visual, thought provoking movie that earned itself the #22 spot on the AFI top movies of all time listing. If you're an impatient sort, you'll get bored quickly. The movie is over 2 hours long and less than half of that has people speaking, never mind other more strenuous activity. It is a movie about you - the watcher - reacting and thinking about the situations. They don't tell you what to think or how to feel. You see what is going on, and you draw your own impressions, and come up with your own conclusions.That's a lot to ask of an audience, and how you react to the movie will have a lot to do with your personality. Some people just aren't interested in this sort of slow going thoughtful exercise. And that's fine - there are plenty of action space movies out there. For those who seek something more intricate, grab a glass of wine, a plate of cheese and fruit, and sit back. You're in for a treat.It's best if you watch this movie once through without reading a lot about the plot or its multiple layers of meaning - that way you can see it with a fresh mind and draw your own reactions and ideas from what you've seen. Undoubtedly you'll have questions about some areas! At that point, search the web and find the MANY discussions about this movie, unravelling the symbolism. See if you agree or disagree with what's being said, then watch it again. This is the type of movie you can watch again, every year, and learn something new from it.Highly recommended."	5.0	A Must-Have for your DVD Library	2007-07-07	2	2	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3NYZB4V55CZIM	Liz	2001: A Space Odyssey has been hailed as a masterpiece. I'm not denying the cultural significance of the film. It's a story of evolution, told with Kubrick's distinct vision. However, at a whopping 141 minutes, and with very little dialogue - I found this movie difficult to watch. At times is bordered on pretentious with the grandiose ideas it was touching upon. It's likely to polarize viewers. Hardcore science fiction fans should really enjoy this film, but it may be lost on the casual viewer. Unfortunately I fell into the latter category.	3.0	Good, Not Great	2012-12-20	0	0	0

There was a story buried in there, but the scenes were all very long and it felt more like a sound and light show than a genuine movie-though for the late 1960's the special effects were certainly spectacular.The movie begins with a long scene of apelike creatures prancing around and fighting, introduced by many establishing scenes and lots of classical music.  Then a black monolith appears, fascinating the apes-and later on they are shown to now use tools.Cut to the space age.  Astronauts are sent to the Moon (the movie was made a year before we actually put people on it) and find-another monolith, though nothing comes of it right away.  Then another mission is sent to the orbit of Jupiter, in a spaceship controlled by the sentient supercomputer HAL.  The story finally picks up when there is a falling-out between the astronaut crew and HAL...but what were the monoliths all about, and who made and placed them?Unfortunately there are too many beautiful scenes and too little story, and too few questions answered.  Famous for being a period piece, but it isn't too great otherwise.	2.0	A Long Show Of Special Effects	2014-06-13	4	0	4
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK	"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing"""	"I am pleased that I was able to see ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" in its original release in 1968, and then a few years later in a re-release. That few attended the movie both times is a testament to how abstract this film is, in combination with the best technical precision that Arthur C. Clarke could achieve. For those who have seen the movie and did not like it, please return to watching wrestling or sitcoms. Everyone else please read on.Arthur C. Clarke wrote a short story titled ""The Sentinel."" Stanley Kubrick took the short story and extended it into a 145 minute exploration of how we came to be, and where we might go. For those with the patience to immerse themselves in this vision, and to attempt to understand it, the journey is one of the few portrayed in movies to achieve the promise of science fiction.This vision begins at the dawn of a possible origin of mankind. We see an ape-like creature beset by the horrors of a world that the creature does not control. These creatures are little more than scavenging animals. Kubrick provides enough scenery of these creatures to understand them. Into the world of these creatures comes a black monolith. Soon the creatures learn to use a bone as a weapon, and we realize that somehow the black monolith has boosted the ape-like creature's intelligence, kicking off the long path to our near future (well, it was the near future in 1968).Now we are on a space ship that is traveling to a space station as we envisioned them in the 60s. The Pan Am (well, in a different world Pan Am could still exist) space ship is shown in glorious detail approaching and docking with the superbly imagined space station. Once on the space station we are again shown visual wonders, as people are shown walking on the curved rings of the space station.However, while the space ship and the space station are technical marvels, they are interludes to the real show on the moon, where another black monolith was found. Once on the moon, we travel to Tyco crater where the black monolith was discovered. While the monolith is being examined, it sends a radio signal to one of Jupiter's moons. Being people, we have to journey to Jupiter to learn what the signal was being sent to.On the way to Jupiter the crew of the immense space ship Discovery runs into a minor problem. Their HAL-9000 computer develops a bit of paranoia, and decides to eliminate the human crew. Unfortunately, the computer manages to get the upper hand with everyone except for Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea). Even Dr. Bowman has the bad luck to be outside Discovery when HAL decides it is time to take over the ship, and HAL will not let Dr. Bowman back into the ship. What follows is one of the best scenes in the movie, as Dr. Bowman takes a big risk to return to the ship.One technical point about Bowman's re-entry to the ship; Bowman should have exhaled prior to going into semi-vacuum, not inhaled. The rapid decrease in air pressure would have caused the air exiting his lungs to damage them.Once inside the ship Bowman make his way to HAL's core, and in one of the most poignant scenes between a man and a computer in any movie, returns HAL to a mere automaton.Kubrick keeps the delay between HAL's defeat and the arrival at Jupiter to a minimum. As you can imagine, there is yet another black monolith floating about in space. This time the monolith leads to a passageway to another region of space. As Bowman transports from Jupiter to some incredible distance away, Kubrick uses every technical trick in his 1960s arsenal to show the journey. We also see Bowman age.We then see overlapping eras as Dr. Bowman ages at his destination, and his ultimate transformation into the star child. Considering the purpose of the original black monolith, which was to help to elevate the creature that became known as man, and given that the other monoliths would only be discovered by a space-faring race that should be ready for the next step in evolution, I surmise that the purpose of the star child was to return to Earth and help man take the next evolutionary step forward.A brief word about the soundtrack. Prior to seeing this movie I was unfamiliar with ""Also Sprach Zarathustra,"" the music that opens and closes the movie. However, the music seems fitting to herald great beginnings, and even at the end of the movie the presence of the star child was a beginning, not an ending. This song easily sends chills down my spine when played in the theater or on my home sound system (crank up the sub-woofer and hold on to the crystal). This music is coupled with new age (as we call it now) and classical music that fit perfectly with the visual effects. The choice of music was critical for this movie.This movie is esoteric, which is a fancy way of saying it is great for geeks who like to think and analyze. However, watch this movie only when you can watch its 145 minutes from beginning to end, without distraction, with total immersion, and an open mind. If you are a creationist do not watch this movie, you will not like it. If you continue to think, as I do, that there are yet great things to come for us as a species, then sit back in your chair, turn out the lights, and engage your brain for a journey that I hope will never end."	5.0	Still One of the Greatest Science Fiction Movies	2005-07-31	7	6	1

I could follow along through about 50% of it, but the rest was beyond my comprehension. After I watched the film, I searched for reviews that would give me more meaning into the film. From what I gathered from the film and the reviews, I find the meaning and point of the movie to be fascinating. I really was able to reflect deeply into the various perspectives this film offers. However, the film itself is rather drawn out at 2.5 hours and could have been cut shorter. This resulted in some of the ""psychedelic"" and ""bizarre"" scenes to become repetitive/monotonous/boring. At times I almost fell asleep. Regardless though, if you can follow the movie and see it through, do the best you can to put the puzzle pieces together.

Many people complain about the slowness of many of the scenes, but fail to realize Kubrick did this for a reason.  I do indeed find this movie intellectually stimulating to a large extent, but the problem I have is that Kubrick was a little too obscure for my taste.  I would have respected this movie much more if he had actually made some clear points and not left so much to the imagination.  For example, what in the world is going on with the whole alien concept?  What is he trying to say?  The answer to that is that he isn't trying to say anything according to interviews I have read.  This, I believe, is a weak and &quot;cop out&quot; approach.

Fantastic how the visual effects used at that time are still great-looking until this day.  Great plot, great performances...I mean, everything on this film is great.  And we all thank only one person...the late great filmmaker Stanley Kubrick.The way I see it, this wonderful movie best describes the development of man from the moment he is born, through his growth, until the time when he dies, thus completing some sort of life cycle.  The &quot;Dawn Of Man&quot; segment is fantastic at conveying how man -here in the form of apes - evolves, developing certain skills, like killing for their food and staying alive.  The Jupiter mission continues describing that evolution with man traveling in outer space.  Finally we see how Commander David Bowman (Keir Dullea) travels through some sort of passageway to growing old and dying, and then being reborn.  All those moments are well united thanks to the use of a monolyth as a unifying device.  Many people would say I'm nuts, but this film is open to many interpretations, and that's where its magnificence lies.Definitely Stanley Kubrick created the quintessential science-fiction classic that has undoubtedly become one of my favorite movies ever.	5.0	A Sci-Fi Milestone Indeed	2003-12-07	16	12	4

The print was worn and scratched and it didn't matter a bit.  The movie comes from a short story named The Sentinel by Arthur C. Clarke in which men landing on the moon set off some kind of radio signal device left by a higher intelligence many years before.  A mission to Jupiter ensues when it is believed that the radio signal emitting from the obelisk is sending a signal to a moon of Jupiter's.  The story is not the point in this movie, but the experience.  From the beginning of intelligence in mankind which the movie implies is prompted by an obelisk that visits our early ancestors, right through to infinity, the experience is quiet and slow.  The movie has visuals that overwhelm the senses and it is not unlike the definitive LSD trip described in the 60s movies.	5.0	Greatest Science Fiction Film	2010-09-11	1	1	0

I watched the film in the cinema decades ago and I own the DVD - nothing comes close to this HD-DVD. This is IMO the best version ever made and issued. You can see details not seen before and the space ship models offer breathtaking details, not to mention the interior and the colours.The sound in Dolby TrueHD has such an clarity and resolution that I had the impression I could locate and identify single instruments in the orchestra and I was listening via optical output only not via bit-stream and HDMI 1.3. Overall this HD-DVD is really impressive regarding sound and picture. The disk contains also a lot of extras like different featurettes, making of's and interviews.But you can not compare this film with the special effects e.g. in Tranformers or alike. 2001 is an old film from 1968 but the special effects are still great.However, I guess this is the best transfer of the film we will see. I compared it to the DVD version and there is a huge difference. I can recommend everybody who knows the film and owns the DVD to buy this HD-DVD version. It was for me really worth the buy.	5.0	For lovers of 2001 the absolute must	2007-12-02	3	3	0

Frankly, when you considered that was written and shot in the mid 60's, this story has an amazing vision.Sure, it never became apocryphal in the way the at people hoped, but that does not stop it being breathtaking all the same.An alien monolith helps mankind evolve, and then another is found on the moon. When a third is found around Jupiter, Mankind send a ship to investigate, not realising that the computer has a fatal flaw.Cue death, madness, and a creeping sense of claustrophobia. The sets look like they directly inspired Lucas' Star Wars, and whilst the CG effects at the end are of their time, the revelation are no less profound.Definitely recommended.	4.0	To boldly go...	2013-12-11	0	0	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AK9UPC78LIPIR	maelje	"...and review the film the only way I know how: As a person who believes this isn't simply the best film Stanley Kubrick ever made, but also the best movie in cinematic history. Forget ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Vertigo"" or ""Casablanca"" or ""The Godfather""; ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" changed the course of movie history.Prior to ""2001,"" many directors (and audience members) still seemed to regard films as a kind of extension of the stage; movies, with the aid of special effects, could do things that a theatrical production couldn't, but aside from that, the storytelling methods were still very much like a play. The dependency on sets is understandable in some contexts; what puzzles more is that film, THE visual medium, was still quite insistent on a relative preponderance of dialogue.Not even Kubrick had dared go this far prior to ""2001""; of its 142-minute running time (trimmed from the premiere length of 161 minutes), only about three-quarters of an hour consisted of dialogue. Furthermore, what dialogue there was seemed almost deliberately banal, as if Kubrick were further telegraphing the message to his viewers that the meaning of this film could not be derived from mere words.The story, rather, was in the visuals -- and what visuals they were, and remain.The film opens several million years in the past. A group of bipeds -- call them early apelike humans or late humanlike apes -- struggles to survive in the hostile climate of Africa. They regularly have disputes, which consist mostly of guttural shouts, with another group visually identical to themselves; said disputes often take place, apparently, at a miserable-looking little watering hole. One night, a mysterious object appears near the sleeping cave of the first group: A black monolith. Over time, it seems to do something to these creatures, increasing their intelligence somehow. The group learns, for one thing, to kill for meat. For another, its next encounter with the ""adversary"" group is not limited to mere words.Following this, there occurs what must be, by now, the most famous jump-cut in film history.Part two of ""2001"" takes place in the very late 1990s or perhaps 2000. Unlike our ""real"" 1990s, humans have achieved rather more; there is now a full-time base on the Moon, and travel between Earth and Moon is as commonplace. Dr. Heywood Floyd is sent to the American component of the Moon outposts to deal with an odd discovery -- an object that had been buried in the lunar soil. Yes, a black monolith. Upon its first exposure to sunlight, the object emits a powerful blast of radio energy.Part three of the film concerns ""The Jupiter Mission,"" eighteen months later, in 2001. A crew of two humans is piloting the spaceship Discovery on an exploratory mission to the moons of the solar system's largest planet. Also on board: Three more men in suspended animation or hypersleep, a survey team that will be awakened only when the ship completes its long journey to Jovian space. The sixth crew member is not human, but rather a sentient computer named HAL.The mission does not go as planned. With great respect to those who have not seen this masterpiece, I decline to offer any plot spoilers. Suffice it to say that the goals of men and machines do not always mesh.Part four of ""2001"" is surely one of the strangest, most fascinating, most thought-provoking sequences ever put on the big screen. Mission Commander David Bowman must confront something -- someone? -- far beyond the realm of his experience. Even if I wanted to describe what happens to him, I'm not sure I could do it justice, and I have seen the movie dozens and dozens of time.But it is here, among stars far, far from Earth, that the film's multiplicity of meanings becomes evident. The ending of ""2001"" has provided dialogue, discussion, argument, and at times quite heated argument to several generations of film watchers by now. The fact that no two people seem to get exactly the same thing out of the film is testament to its greatness.Though released in 1968, few other science fiction films made in the ensuing four and a half decades have managed to look this good. In addition to pondering the very meaning of existence, Kubrick's film has provided eye candy to millions and millions of geeks. The look of science fiction, especially space-based science fiction, owes a tremendous amount to this film. From the ""Star Trek"" films, with their visuals upgraded from the 1960s TV series, to the ships of ""Star Wars"" to ""Battlestar Galactica"" and so on, it's hard to imagine any of them without ""2001."" Even Ridley Scott owes a debt; certainly he strove to grunge things up with ""Alien"" and ""Prometheus,"" but he would be the first to admit that his visual style would not have evolved as it did without Stanley Kubrick and ""2001.""I guess by now you realize I highly recommend the film. Just one caveat: Be warned that it moves at a pace that was considered very slow even in 1968. I prefer to think of it as ""stately."" Those without the patience for its peculiar world, though, will conclude it's simply boring. A few people, over the years, have confessed to me that this was, indeed, their dim view of the film. In each and every case, the person in question was an acquaintance, and not someone I ever chose to pursue friendship. One woman, indeed, was so arrogantly dismissive of the film that I downgraded my view of her from merely odious to absolutely vile. In short, the film does not seem to appeal to those who are unimaginative, even though they may be reasonably intelligent. Sadly, but truly, some of us are Earthbound.For the rest of us: Behold this starry black sky, and all it may offer."	5.0	I hereby cast objectivity aside...	2012-09-20	5	4	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	I'm a big sci-fi fan, so of course this movie is one of my all-time favorites. But one thing I wanted to mention that amused me about the flick was how well it played among the psychedelic crowd back then.When this movie came out, the headtrippers among my friends and acquaintances, thinking that it would be great to merge the exploration of inner space with the exploration of outer space, perhaps, would get high on LSD and then go see this movie. They especially liked the part with the colorful special effects where Bowen is going through the Star Gate with the equally trippy, dissonant sound track by Gyorgi Ligeti, in the background. I found this pretty amusing, since they were usually too stoned or tripped out to really try to follow the flick or figure anything out about the movie, and many of them weren't really sci- fi fans, anyway. They were just there for the spectacular visual effects, and this movie had what was state of the art at the time.Most of these people eventually got over their fascination with recreational chemicals, but at the time, 2001 and a 20-microgram dose of bathtub LSD was about the coolest scene around for these people.Anyway, I just thought that was sort of funny, since they probably missed the point of the whole movie, if there was one. Well there was, but you really needed to read the book to find that out. The tune in, turn on, and drop out aspect of the movie aside, it's certainly one of the great classics, and possibly Kubrick's greatest flick, also.	5.0	A spacey movie in more ways than one--for some people	2002-11-20	2	1	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3NX4X0E3JQ4JS	Magic Fingers	"I, too, saw this film in 1968, so I'm not an adolescent, and I remember very well the impact of the event. That being said, anyone interested in buying this movie as a 'home video', trying to replicate the original intended theatre experience, will be greatly disappointed.Let's start at the beginning: Most movie versions of popular books tend to be rather incomplete or deviate wildly from their literary parent by the time it gets to the screen. Before men actually walked on the moon, the cinematic effort just to achieve the revolutionary visual effects we see here seems to have been all encompassing for the director, to the distraction of trying to involve us in the deep narrative that made the Arthur C. Clarke novel one of the most provocative and probing works of the age. While both realistic and psychedelic images combined with imaginative classical works are intended to impress the senses, the story-line is almost senseless in this telling, forcing the viewer to tax their own imagination in order to fill in the blanks. So large are the blanks that without the benefit of reading the book first, you would fall asleep, if it were not for the sonic and scenic thrill ride. Unfortunately, sitting through this disc, I found it very hard to keep my eyes (and ears) open.First thing we need to get straight is that the word 'anamorphic' seems to be thrown around at everything that isn't made for standard TV. ""2001:A Space Odyssey"" IS NOT anamorphic and never was. It was shot in Super-Panavision 2.2:1; NOT Ultra-Panavision 2.6:1 which requires anamorphic lenses to display a little wider aspect ratio. What's missing is the deeply curved Cinerama screen this film was designed to be projected on, which makes it look wider and gives it a bit of 3D. You don't have that at home, and neither do I, so the extra depth and dimension required to complete the effect just isn't there, but would help this movie very much if such a thing becomes available for home use in the future. (NOTE: This picture would be a good candidate for the ""Smile-Box"" effect recently developed by Dave Strohmaier for rendering true Cinerama films to flat screens.)Now, putting aside the men in monkey suits and outdated visions of space travel, my biggest problem with this 'newly remastered' DVD (with no extras!???) is finding the lowest quality picture and sound on disc that I have come across in many years. Whether you are a fan of Mr. Kubrick's original production or not, the technical rendering on this DVD is atrocious. The picture is fuzzy and dim, the sound is screechy, lo-fi, and just barely stereophonic.My senses have been underwhelmed and I want my money back!!"	1.0	RIPPP-OFFFF!	2007-09-10	17	4	13

More important, however, was reading The Sentinel the short (very short) story that inspired the movie.  If you haven't read it, do so.  It sets the stage for the movie in a brillliant way, and allowed me to understand the basic message and central theme that never sunk in before.2001 is a brilliant, outlandishly personal and philosophical voyage that Hollywood would never dream of making today.

'the sentinel,'  clarke's short story, covers merely the part of the movie that takes place  on the moon.  also(in response to a previous reviewer), kubrick inserted  the overture and intermission, NOT TED TURNER!  from where that bit of  insight came, i do not know.  lastly, i noticed that a few people referred  to kubrick as an 'idiot.'  he may not be john woo...he's just the finest  film-maker moving pictures have ever seen.  i have the widescreen VHS  version and the DVD, and i have no problems with either.  this movie  supercedes any technical problem put before it.	5.0	the best	1999-04-08	1	1	0

I am a serious moviebuff, and just finished watching 2001 for the first time.  I absolutely loved this movie and want to read the book and its sequels. I am starting to understand the ending as I think about it and read the other reviews, and I fully get Kubrick's decision to end the movie as he did.  Also at first I didn't get why Kubrick decided to put the ape section in, but as I neared the end of the film, I realize that the movie ended in a full-circle.  It showed the primitive beginning of human technology, (and also aggressiveness, as the ape promptly killed another ape with his bone, and became filled with pride) to the most advanced, (the thinking computer).  The end was the reset in the circle and the start of a new wave of advancement, but one that couldn't be obtained by humans alone, for we weren't advanced enough to create it.  I am pretty sure this is a good representation of the plot, but I need to see the second movie and read the book first. Overall a visually stunning and highly entertaining movie.

Perhaps it is a generational thing?  Then, we were concerned with our existential future - a nasty Cold War was on and we all knew we could be gone in an instant.  The Space Race was on, and just about every American kid was in on it.  There was a huge metaphysical revolution going on then too.  Today, the kids have computers and think that everyone who didn't grow up with computers don't know anything.  If you can't do email you are a dinosaur and marked for extinction.  Movies must have the latest computer generated effects to be cool at all.  We understood the idea of artificial intelligence then and there were a number of film themes that focused on the fear of machines taking over because so many were losing their once secure jobs to automation.  New then, commonplace now.  Still, after all this, I find that 2001 pretty much divides the intellects from the non-intellects; I have always found that people bored by 2001 are themselves - boring.	5.0	The Great Divide	2007-09-30	13	7	6

Our culture has morphed greatly over the decades since 2001 was released. Our perceptions of the world around us are different than those who were around in the late 60's, so watching 2001 for us in the newer generation is like looking back in hindsight at the minds of generations past.Having said that, 2001 is the worst movie I have ever seen. This is three hours of the most boring uninteresting cinema I have ever witnessed. The vast majority of the film is pretty pictures set to elevator music with most everything happening in what seems like real time. Some examples:1) Want to know how long it takes to exit a space ship for routine ship repair? FOR FU*#ING EVER!2) How about the same scene of the moon rotating in the same damn window framed in grey with no edit or cut away for 10 damn minutes with the same damn music playing over and OVER and OVER AGAIN?3) Do I need to know (and SEE) that it takes 5 WHOLE MINUTES for a hatch to open up into space? DO I??? REALLY?!? AND HOW MANY TIMES DO I NEED TO SEE IT???

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A389E7NNXVGY90	marcvdp	By far my favorite film of all time and the only one which I will give five stars to -- quite literally it goes beyond the infinite. Nearly unparalleled in terms of scope and depth made even better by the fact that you don't know the half of where its going two hours into the movie. The most common criticism of 2001 is that it drags and tends to be a bore and a chore. Get through it. You'll be sucked into an interesting plot about a mission to the moon and jupiter that will seem mundane after the true journey of mankind blows it out of the water. One of the best things about this movie, I think, is its powerful optimism. There are epic films out there that expose weaknesses of humanity, explore the &quot;heart of darkness&quot;, and so forth -- its nice to finally see something with a vision so far reaching and at the same time life-affirming. After finishing 2001, I think I can honestly say that this film is the only one that truly, undoubtably &quot;blew me away&quot;.As a final note, the original DVD (or two actually) released are shoddy as everyone else says. I'm getting a little irritated first with the new re-mastered releases w/ extras and now this $60 supposed limited edition box set.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2KI1SGCZT2OEI	"Mark E. Stenroos ""Sibelius fan"""	"I first saw this film during its initial release at a Cinerama theater in Phoenix. It was quite an experience for a 5th grader!40-plus years later and I STILL don't know that I understand what the movie is ""about."" I suppose I need to watch it again with the commentary track. I've avoided doing so to this point because I'm afraid it might disabuse me of certain ideas I DO have about what the film is ""about."" Then where would I be?I have watched most of the extra features, which are quite valuable. SPOILER ALERT! I learned, for instance, that when the ape-man throws his bone (weapon) into the air and that bone transforms into a space ""ship,"" that that ship is actually a bomb circling the Earth. That little tidbit comes right from the mouth of Arthur C Clarke, who notes that ""it isn't made clear in the film that that's a bomb."" It makes sense: Dawn of Man weapon morphs in Future Man weapon. Another thing I learned was that the computer name ""HAL"" was derived by taking the letters IBM and moving everything back one letter in the alphabet. Clarke mentions that they later came up with some scientific-sounding terminology to explain what HAL stood for.The BD looks and sounds pretty good, though I think it could be even better. There's a lot of black in this movie in the ""outer space"" scenes, so one wonders how black can black be on a BD. The images of people aren't as sharp as I'd hoped they'd be on BD, but that could be put down to the way Kubrick filmed it in the first place. The sound is good, but there are spots where it starts to distort when the volume comes up.The BD is definitely a more-satisfying presentation than the DVD issue which I also own.BTW - as a side note, Kubrick always intended to use classical music in this movie, and he had specific recordings of specific pieces in mind. But to appease the studio, he went ahead and commissioned Alex North to write a film score, which turned out not to be used. It was sort of a cover for Kubrick's plans. Kubrick wanted to use the Karajan/ Vienna Philharmonic recording of the opening of Richard Strauss' ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" as his ""Genesis"" music. Decca - who owned the rights - allowed Kubrick to use the snippet only on the proviso that Kubrick NOT credit Karajan/VPO/Decca in the film credits! They felt that to do so would be a hit against the prestige of Decca. So all you see at the end is a credit for ""Richard Strauss, Thus Spake Zarathustra"" with no performers or record label listed. Every other recording used gets the standard credit that identifies the artists and record label. That's STILL how the credits appear on this 2007 BD - Karajan/Decca aren't credited.The thing is, because Decca wouldn't allow the credit, every classical music label on Earth immediately reissued THEIR existing recordings of ""Zarathustra"" with a BIG sticker on the LP stating, ""As Heard In The Movie 2001 - A Space Odyssey."" Even the official MGM soundtrack for the movie used a different recording of ""Zarathustra"" than what was heard in the film - the soundtrack used the Deutsche Grammophon recording featuring the Berlin Philharmonic under Karl B&ouml;hm.What a bone-headed move by Decca back in 1968.For under $10, this film belongs in your BD collection.Recommended."	5.0	A Good BD With Interesting Extras (Spoilers)	2013-03-15	0	0	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2LFC3XDVQEA6G	Mark from Jersey	This movie is a classic, but I REALLY don't agree with reviewers who find deep 'meaning' in every fraction of a scene, maybe they are indeed 'channeling' the Directors 'Vision' but more than likely just reading too much into it. Case in point, the scene where the wine is spilled, I've heard people describe it's 'meaning' as something to the effect of the wine represents one's 'soul or spirit' and the glass, ones body. Then they say this means the 'body' is gone but the soul remains, pretty heavy stuff, and pretty clever IF that's what the Director intended. I don't buy it though, I think it was SIMPLY a scene transition, for basically common sense reasons, namely it was very short take of the spilled wine, FAR too short for something of that significance, secondly the scene right after is of the man older, so it was just IMHO a scene transition that went like this guy looks over young guy, spills wine look at it for a sec, guy looks back over and the guy is older, just there to make a smooth flow, no other meaning.I wonder how many Directors 'have a laugh' over people dissecting every second of their films and adding 'made up' significance?	5.0	Fantastic, But don't read too much into EVERY Scene.	2010-09-28	1	0	1

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AQFA5M3EZLT4E	Mark	This is cinema and storytelling honed to perfection. Everything you need to understand the tale is offered as visual poetry but nothing is given. Kubrick shows his audience his highest respect by demanding the application of its intelligence. It's all here, but YOU must use your eyes and your brain to understand this film. It's dense, beautiful and very nearly perfect.This is a story about the evolution of tool-making intelligence on Earth, given to our ancestors by an unseen force. And when that intelligence has finally taken us to another planet, the circle begins to close and humanity enters a new phase of evolution. There is science fiction of the highest and most scientific kind on display here but the story is really about redemption. The story is almost religious. It is about rebirth.The more you watch this film, the more you will see and understand. The more you understand, the greater will be your appreciation for the staggering genius of Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke. For me, as a 12 year old boy, 2001 was a life-changing experience that I have never forgotten. From it I learned to admire art and to think about life in a different way. I am 50 years old now and this remains my favorite film of all time.	5.0	One of the Greatest Films Ever	2013-06-08	3	3	0

I was lucky enough to see it on the big screen last year at a special screening in LA, and had my mind blown witnessing it larger than life like that. The Blu-ray release captures much of that experience, with visuals and colors brought back to their original glorious quality. When the space ship dances weightlessly with the space station high above a glowing Earth, it's as breathtaking here as it was on the big screen. The sound has likewise recaptured the wonderful subtleties of silence, murmur, and symphony so important to the experience of this story. The Blu-ray also includes several great special features, including a documentary on the making of the film, an interview with Kubrick, and lovely concept art from the early stages of production, as well as some featurettes about the film's legacy and accuracy.	5.0	Excellent remastering & fun special features	2013-10-10	1	1	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1EXS156IQG7OA	Mark R. Whittington	It's very difficult to explain to anyone who came of age after 1968 what it was like to see 2001 for the first time in a theater. It was to say the least the most awe inspiring cinema experience I had ever had. And that was not the least because people seeing the film for the first time truly believed that they were seeing a peek of what the actually 2001 really would be. It was but a year before Apollo 11, but the future of a great age of space exploration seemed to stretch on forever. The only exasperation I remember having back then was the thought it would be over thirty years before I might too visit the Moon. Seeing the movie in the actual 2001 is an exercise in sadness. The future of lunar settlements and nuclear powered space craft plowing the heavens is still-well-in the future. And that is a blot upon our civilization.(...)	5.0	An Awe Inspiring Vision of a Future Which Never Happened	2001-05-07	2	2	0

The answer was ""no"" -- none of us understood it.The novelization of the story by Arthur C. Clarke pretty much explained it, but without that the story -- at least the ending -- is pretty much incomprehensible. And, as others have pointed out, it is VERY long and slow-paced. Though maybe that's more of a problem for younger, attention-span-challenged viewers.In the end, at least two aspects of the film are still fresh: the special effects of the space station, space craft, moon, etc. (okay, they're not perfect -- the men inside the moon base are obviously walking in earth gravity), and the character of HAL. Having him speak in a normal human voice, instead of the stereotyped robot mono-tone of most sci-fi, was a brilliant stroke. It is sobering to realize that something very similar to HAL will be part of our world in the very near future. Not necessarily truly intelligent and aware, but close enough that the difference will be insignificant."	4.0	"""Anybody understand what that movie was about?"""	2005-08-08	3	2	1

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3JY8AARGY2J3V	Mary Target	Wow. I was moved by this movie in a way I have never been before by anything on the silver screen, simply because I didn't have a clue what any of it meant but I was truly certain that it meant something, and that something was big. I belong, for good or ill, to the generation that my fellow viewer of 2001 described as wasted (for good reason; I am painfully aware of this fact), being 16. Wowed by the matrix and, dare I say it, amused by love actually, a film that could be at best described as good natured paff and requiring the kind of thinking usually achieved by the organisms that amoeba evolved from you wouldn't think I would get much out of the kind of film that 2001 is renowned for being: slow paced, very arty and devoid of any snappy lines or explosions, and neither did I. To my surprise (and, later, relief at perhaps being a bit more intellectual than I had thought) I got the same feeling of entranced exhilaration watching the scenes of pirouetting spacecraft and the smashing of the beast's bones by the believable apes as I did watching Neo dodge those bullets a couple of years ago. I found Hal's death as touching and real as any dying WWII soldier's in Saving Private Ryan. Perhaps there may be some hope for my generation yet. If you are thinking of not buying this film because it's slow or your mate says its rubbish please think again, try it, and we can make a start turning this generation round. Buy it, rent it, steal it - trade in that old gladiator dvd and you may find yourself immersed in a new world of films with layers and deep meanings that you will never see enough times to understand - but you just won't care.	4.0	matrix lover? yes, but desperately wanting to be won round	2004-01-02	11	9	2
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3PA0W1VUDU4J7	Mat	"(...)I will not attempt to discuss the meaning of this film, or to answer most of the questions it poses. There are plenty of places on the internet that try to do that.2001 is one of the few films I find absolutely amazing, and that I dread to watch. Like Citizen Kane I find this movie to be technically brilliant, but mostly boring. It was the first or second dvd that I purchased when I bough my player back in 1999. Yet in the interim 5 odd years I have watched 2001 in its entirety only once or twice. Several times I have started to sit and watch it, but I just can't get through it all at once. Even for this review I watched it in sections.It doesn't help that the section I enjoy the most (the section involving the mission to Jupiter and HAL) is a good hour into the movie. It's not that the other sections do not have meaning to me, it's just that I find them very difficult to get through. The opening sequence ""The Dawn of Man"" is very well filmed, is vital to understanding the whole movie, and begins to ask some very good questions (does the advent of technology bring us closer to destruction as it also further our race? Yet, I find this section mind numbingly dull. Upon first viewing it was interesting, but now I know that the monolith is coming, I know that the ape-men discover the use of the bones as tools and this leads to their use as weapons. My knowledge of the action now bores me. I am the type of person who enjoys watching a movie repeatedly. I have a pretty large collection of DVDs and watch many of them often. So knowing the outcome of a scene does not always neccesitate my boredom. It is just so with this particular film.Likewise the next section of film leading to the discovery of the monolith on the moon I find to be quite boring. It is only when we get to the middle chapter of the movie dealing with the journey to Jupiter and the madness of HAL that I remain interested as a film watcher. This section also happens to be the one I find most technically interesting. I must also admit this is the section with the most dialogue and most action. But I am not ready that this is the cause of my enjoyment. Because by most standards there is still not a lot of action or dialogue going on in the film. What I do enjoy is the use of sets to create the space station atmosphere. For example, I love trying to determine how they created the scenes where the astronauts appear to walk upside down or 'turn' with the ship? The atmosphere created by use of the silence of space, the loneliness of the ship and the remoteness of the all seeing HAL eye is pitch perfect. Kubrick builds the tension between the two conscience astronauts and HAL brilliantly. The scene in which HAL reads the astronauts lips is still one of my favorites in any film, ever. HAL, though a computer, has been rated as one of the greatest scree villains of all time, and rightly so. He is as calculating as he is cold.Once this section ends, though we slip back into the brilliant but boring mode of the film. When Dave slips into the wormhole (did anyone call it a wormhole back then?) we are treated to a psychedelic ride of crazy colors and trippy music. But it goes on so long that I wish I did acid or smoked pot to keep me interested. It's like the whale chapters of Moby Dick, where I have to agree that they are important for the sake of the novel, but I'd rather just skip past them and get on with the story. I believe the parts I find boring in the movie are essential to the film, and in many ways they make it the masterpiece of cinema that it is. This being so doesn't make me watch it more than once every few years.(...)"	5.0	Brilliant	2005-05-03	4	2	2
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A19VLLJBYHQJA6	Matt Dewey	Movie?  No.  Film?  No.  Experience?  Oh yeah.  2001:  A Space Odyssey is absolutely amazing.  The picture and sound on the DVD is awesome (you can find out a little more about my viewing theater in my about page) and worthy of the format.This is a movie that speaks for itself.  The words are kept to a minimum but the imagery and soundtrack are perfect.  I have a very small tolerance for older films that look primative and poorly acted, but 2001, as is true with all Kubrick pictures, is completely timeless.  It is amazing when you think about the period in time during which this film was made (1968, the era of Kennedy, Woodstock and the Moon).  The effects are still flawless today and easily surpass any modern cgi work in terms of actual realism.  Nothing compares to the first time you see 2001, but it manages to reinvent itself each and every time you watch it.I first saw this picture when I was about 10 years old.  My Mom and Dad took me to the University of Illinois to the computer open house where I first saw HAL 9000 and saw 2001:  A Space Odyssey projected onto a classroom wall.  The movie blew me away and started an intense facination with space and space travel.  No movie I have ever seen has been more inspiring.Ok, sorry for rambling on about my experiences with the movie but simply talking about the movie would not due it justice.

After viewing my original opy of 2001 for only 45 minutes, I stopped watching it.  I took a chance with Amazon and found that there were close-captioned copies available.  Now  that I have a close-captioned copy, I was able to understand every word  with it instead of turning up the volume.  Still, the music of Also Sprach  Zaranthrusta is powerfully driven.  I really do wonder where in the world  we would be right now if we had computers like the HAL-9000 controlling our  homes without Big Brother giving it a secret order, like what I saw when  HAL first stated the problem with the AE-35 antenna.  The movie was so  realistic unlike most grade-B sci-fi films now and then, except for Star  Wars.  The monolith can have a very astronomical effect on anyone trying to  think what it is, why it is there, and how it was created.

I can see how some may perceive this movie to be boring, especially towards the beginning. It does have good special effects considering it was the 60's. There is a little action to be had during the HAL scenes towards the end, but probably not enough to keep the attention of action fans.

BUT in my opinion this IS ONE OF THE LASIEST SCI_FI FILMS EVER!!! For one thing talk about a movie without a plot. There are four somewhat related stories told in this movie. Although the movie makes no effort to coherently connect the four, nope not at all. I was 16 when i saw this when, it was over I had become 71. I'm sorry but the filmakers were obviously so proud of the visual effects they had concocted they felt it was necessary to have 20 minute long scenes of a ship floating through space. If this doesn't suck the years out of your life I don't know what can. This movie would have succeded if the whole thing was about Hal and the problems that he caused and something could have been said interms of theme about technology but NO OF COURSE NOT WE HAVE COOL VISUAL EFFECTS LETS USE THEM!!! Oh and that little thing about human evolution and how the aliens have sent the monalithe to help us do so, but instead of doing this interestingly they just stuck the main charachter (well he isn't exactly the main charachter because he came in half way through the movie) in a room and made him get old. I discussed this with a friend of mine who is a die hard fan of 2001 and she says, ""Read the book it helps."" I'm sorry but making film adaptations of books is so the reading doesn't have to be done or to help understand the book better or just to see the story on the big screen, Not so you can watch the film then read the book to understand it that defeats the purpose of making the film in the first place. Finally after disscussing with my film teacher he says, ""Its just because its overly artsy."" NO NO NO NO my friends this movie is just lazy lazy lazy. The whole purpose for it being made was to propel the visual effect industry.

This is one of the most subjective works in cinematic history, and rightfully so. It is also among a small handful of flawless films; its technical perfection in particular is undeniable.I sat through all 2 1/2 hours in one viewing session, taking no breaks. This has never happened to me before outside the cinema. 2001 had a captivating, awe-inspiring, spiritual effect on me unlike any other film I have experienced. Its majesty - facilitating the opening of my subconscious - kept me transfixed on what is essentially music married to visuals with a near absence of drama (save for the thrilling HAL sequence) and very little dialogue.2001 transcends the traditional three act structure; it is a symphony of four movements, closely resembling Beethoven's 9th (my favorite orchestral composition).1st: Dawn of Man - lays the groundwork and themes (that will be echoed later) for what is to follow. The ""larval"" stage.2nd: A sterile, silly yet plausible utopia, mirroring the jokey second movement. Mankind in its ""pupa"" stage.3rd: The dark, moody movement which contains the film's only conflict (between HAL and the astronauts). The Discovery ship is the cocoon and the central character jettisoning from it (after a cold, bloodless set of murders that are reflections of the furious, violent apes at the beginning) leads to the emergence of the butterfly.4th: Glorious, indescribable, orgasmic Presto movement.

Alot of people don't understand, why the first 20 minutes of the film has nothing but a bunch of Apes going crazy. It's a film that isn't rewarding right away in regards to the story, but you should go into this film with a open mind and patience.Using a Panasonic 58"" Plasma, I'm happy to say the video quality on this disk is down right striking. Just the opening shots of beautiful landscapes will no doubt impress all HD none believers. If that doesn't impress you, then the very impressive transistion from the Ape throwing the bone to deep space will really drop jaws. Detail on this BR-Disk is just light years ahead of what SD-DVD ever could offer. This movie is going to be 40 yrs old next year, and it hasn't aged a bit.Also, to me this film looks more realistic than any CGI Sci-Fi movie. Actually, many pre CGI Sci-Films look more realistic than what you would see today. Blade Runner is another movie that still looks fresh today. I can't wait until that is released on Blu-ray this December. There is something about using miniatures that can't be matched when using CGI.I almost forgot to mention, the whole movie was shot using 65mm Super Panavison Cameras, that capture detail that far exceeds 35mm anamorphic Cameras.Sound quality is really great given the age of this film. It doesn't have crazy surround sound action going on that you will find in more modern action flicks. Though, the Uncompressed PCM 5.1 track really gives off a great ambience throughout the whole film, that 2.0 setups will never be able to replicate. Overall, a very clean soundtrack that sets the mood.Extras don't really concern me, but this disk offers a nice selection of bonus features that some will appreciate.If you own a Blu-ray player and love this movie, then it is a no brainer buy it now.Easily, a perfect 5 stars."	5.0	This is the best way to view one of the best films of all time.	2007-11-06	8	7	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3PR4ZSBDUL4EG	"Matthew S. Schweitzer ""zohoe"""	Kubrick's 2001 is not for everyone.  But anyone with a little bit of insight and imagination will not be able to help being captivated by this wonderful and powerful film.  2001 is not only a realistic space epic, it is a commentary on the past, present, and future of mankind.  It shows how small humanity is in the grand scheme of the universe and how we hold our destiny in our own hands.  This film prompted a lifelong interest in science, space exploration, and technology.  It's effect was similar to that of another great sci-fi epic, Star Wars, but it is by far a much deeper and overall, really, a technically better film.  It remains the only movie to accurately depict human spaceflight, though Arthur C. Clarke got the timeframe for space colonization off the mark by a few years.  But keep in mind that at the time, no one was predicting, as Clarke did, the tremendous potential and impact that computers and artificial intelligence would have on future society.  Take a look around today and , though we don't have HAL yet, see how much of he did get right, and how our technology and computers have permeated our entire planet.  This represents the hope, and the danger, facing all mankind.So much of this film has been absorbed by pop culture it is amazing...&quot;What are you doing Dave?&quot;...The Star Child...HAL...The Blue Danube...it truly stands as a monument to cinema and it is a film that I cannot recommend highly enough.	5.0	Defiantely One of the Top 10 Films	2002-01-18	4	2	2

DVD releases of this film, which were atrocious in differing ways with regard to the video quality. The more recent of the two was jittery, loaded with dot crawl, macro-blocking and edge enhancement, dull in terms of color, and balanced very poorly in brightness.Watching the Blu-Ray release was a revelation. Detail is through the roof with no visible edge enhancement, blacks are rock solid, colors are brilliant, and motion is clean and jitter-free. I popped in the old DVD disc to compare, and it is like the difference between night and day. Where before, the monolith was a jittery gray with color banding up and down its length, the blu-ray gives us a clean, rich, deep black. Space scenes glitter with the detail of stars, but also display inky, solid blacks which never falter. Wrinkles and imperfections of characters' skin are evident, and any of a thousand knobs, buttons and dials in backgrounds can be read. Standout scenes: approaching Clavius Moon Base (wow, the Moon!); The first prehistoric Monolith reveal; Heywood Floyd's arrival on the orbiting station (check out that elevator!). Put simply, if you are at all a fan of the film, and you have anything approaching normal visual acuity, this disc is certainly worth the purchase, especially at a mere $20.This is truly as close as I can imagine any home video release coming to the original experience of 2001 in a theater - it may be better in fact given the limitations of technology and equipment at the various times the film was in release. I watched the film on my 50"" Sony SXRD set, but can only imagine and salivate at the prospects of watching on a quality front projector at 100-inches plus.Better yet, there is a full complement of extra features that truly add to the experience, including interviews with Arthur C. Clarke, Stanley Kubrick, and good informational features. And thanks to Blu-Ray's beefy storage capacity, they're all on one disc.This is as close to a no-brainer as a high definition disc purchase can get. The quality offered is clearly and vastly superior to current releases, the price is low, and the special features are at least the equal of any previously available. This is not like Superman Returns or Kingdom of Heaven, where the jump in quality is just not noticeable enough to justify any extra cost or (gasp!) a double dip. This is a case of the DVD release being utterly blown away by the Blu-Ray (or HD DVD) release. I can't help but give it my highest possible recommendation for any fan of the film, a strong recommendation for sci fi fans in general, and a generally good recommendation for the casual viewer who just wants something great to try out his new high definition system."	5.0	Finally, a transfer of 2001 that doesn't inspire one to gouge their eyes out...	2007-11-20	11	9	2

At once one of the greatest Science Fiction movies of all time, it also stands as a piece of existential poetry. It grasps the audience in a way to absorb them into the character of &quot;Hal&quot; but away from the human characters who are made into more of a robot Hal is. Kubrick leaves it up to interpretation just what exactly the meaning of the &quot;monolith&quot; is making the audience try to go beyond the realms of their reality to something else (explaining everything was what really ruined the &quot;sequel&quot; to me).	5.0	A poetry of the cosmos.	2002-05-18	1	1	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AAS960HT6KCXE	Max Moya	"This is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. Some times I wonder if the main objective of Kubrik was to show beauty at its best. The treatment of colour is outstanding and better than in all other Kubrik movies. The camera is still and rooms ussually showed in symetry, and the music simply brilliant, from ""Thus Spake Saratustra"" to ""The Blue Danube"".I tend to get over excited with it, so I will now stick to the factual. The dialogues are by no means difficult to follow. Yet, the story as a whole is. Bear in mind that you do not need to interpret the movie as a linear structure. The three main parts are not totally divorced but are different enough to make you aware of the similies between them. The Science Fiction issue puts down some people, and Star Trek and Trekies is to blame. However, I have never seen a Sci-Fi movie which resembles so much the year 2001. The story was the combined effort of Stanley Kubrik and Arthur C. Clarke and is thus accurate - there are no lame computer-freak dialogues or high-tech cloathes. Furthermore, it is also accurate in the sense that the Cold War seems to be a thing of the past.Finally, expect the finest science-fiction movie ever made, and of course, the most aesthetical and profound."	5.0	The most beautiful thing I have ever seen.	2003-05-03	1	1	0

It is densely layered film that demands  active participation by requiring you to wrestle meaning out of the film. Opinions are so divided on this classic film that I will confine my comments to the Blu-ray transfer.  I love the film, it is a stunning work of visual splendor and creativity. This it is exactly the kind of film that exemplifies the capacity and brilliance of Blu-ray technology.One of the most stunning achievements of quality transferred classic movies is how the Blu-ray technology makes the film quality look as if it were shot today. The fine focus on details and vibrant re-rendering of color make for a breath taking experience. 2001 is a visual arts movie and for a film buff this film alone justifies purchasing a Blu-ray player.There are many aspects that date the film to some extent. But the visual art of this film has stood the test of time and has been given a new life through the Blu-Ray technology. If you're a fan, the Blu-ray version is a must have upgrade. If you've never seen 2001, the Blu-ray is absolutely the best way to experience this masterpiece for the first time.	5.0	I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission	2012-03-21	10	10	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1LQOPUN8C1C4U	"M. Detko ""detkoralph"""	First saw this when it came out at the theatre, in &quot;Cinerama&quot; - think of three regular-sized 70mm screens butted against each other and folded in around you. It made it possible to experience some of the grandeur of space-flight. The scene where the moon shuttle flies across the landscape takes at least 10-15 seconds to go from one side to the other. It was spectacular and breath-taking in this format. Now it's been shrunk to your little picture tube. It is quite radical, considering the scale of the original experience.The movie makes perfect sense, if you pay attention and let the story unfold. Put simply, aliens leave a teaching machine on earth for the apes, and another on the moon which lets off a signal to the home world when man gets there and is technologically advanced enough to find it. What happens then? We send some astronauts in a computer-controlled ship to see where that signal was aimed. Completely awe-inspiring but not &quot;Die-Hard&quot; in terms of action. The most intense part is when HAL the computer goes nuts and endangers the crew, and the final scenes create confusion and awe at the same time. The ending is cryptic, but if you read the book (before or after, doesn't matter you'll have to watch it several times anyhow) you will understand why Kubrick decided to show Bowman's transformation to the &quot;star-child&quot; in this way. Arthur C Clarke was never a writer like Hemingway, but he was great at description and could tell a decent tale. This is a fitting monument to a man who has envisioned many things that have come to pass, and indeed if you watch this film you will notice things that are now common (global communication), and things that are still to come. For that reason and Kubrick's complete mastery of every scene and detail, this film is absolutely timeless. By the way the SOUNDTRACK of this film remains incredible, and hopefully you have a good system to make up for the tiny picture that used to be 100 feet long.	5.0	Honey I shrunk the Genuis - Read the book as well	2003-09-11	6	5	1

Yes, the special effects were amazing- especially for the time it was made.  But oh my gosh!!  The whole movie moves soooo slowly!!  I thought I was going to go crazy!  Luckily I had the ability to fast-forward.  I really pity those who sat through the whole thing in a theater.  I really thought I was going to go out of my mind.I suppose it's because in 2007, we're so accustomed to a lot of fast-paced and action-packed movies.  So we find it very difficult to appreciate slow-paced movies.  It requires a great deal of patience.  I don't have that kind of patience.  In my opinion, this movie is a complete waste of time.  There is virtually no plot!  And the little plot there is, doesn't make any sense!  It just leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions.  Who enjoys that?

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AIZIFDQJECYXZ	"""memdoc"""	I love this movie because it is so challenging, yet, serene and beautiful even after repeated viewing.  The challenge ranges from simply overcoming the boredom of certain scenes to the profound philosophical and theological questions raised throughout.  For example, one may think of the monolith as an alien intelligence or as the apple in the garden of Eden.  Once touched it imparts self-awareness and intelligence.  Moreover, it is the presence of the monolith which is crucial to the sense of time in the movie.  The only significant moments in the history of human beings are encounters with the monolith.  Most of the events between encounters with the monolith are not shown because they are only of trivial significance in the greater scheme of the the universe and of human progress.  Then, of course, there is the man-made intelligence of HAL, the end product of technological advance, which originated with the use of an animal bone for a weapon.  The finite and flawed man-made intelligence versus the infinitely influential alien/divine intelligence with perfect geometry seem to be in conflict.  It is almost as if HAL reacts out of feelings of insecurity in the face of a more perfect being.  Perhaps, HAL and the monolith are engaged in a duel for Dave's soul, a la Job.  Perhaps, HAL falls from grace because he lacks a soul.  Certainly, one can suggest the story is one of birth and rebirth, death and resurrection, or, maybe, evolution from human to the next species.I think Kubrick, always the strategist,  made many scenes boring to express the vastness of space and the duration of time required for space travel.  Yet he covers the breadth of human history with a single edit, flying bone to flying space craft.  He really manages to make us humans feel very very small in a very very large and unknown universe.  And he does this with very little dialogue and extremely detailed, beautiful photography.  Our voice in space and history is also very small and insignificant by comparison with the monumental influence of the monolith during a mere two encounters with human beings.  We don't know or even understand very much about the monolith, our universe, nor our own nature.  Yet we pursue the mysterious monolith to the ends of our solar system, as though it calls to us from afar.	5.0	My favorite movie.	2002-07-23	5	5	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A6DVLN7LPVSKD	"Mephistopheles ""Mephistopheles"""	This is to cinema what The Mona Lisa is to art.  A masterpiece.  This movie is just as much a work of art as the da Vinci, and perhaps much more.  First of all, this is not a shiny, happy action movie, like Star Wars, or  a scary movie as in the Alien series.  This is a movie which defies such  rigid specifications.  This is cinema at its best.The basic premise  of the film is perhaps the least basic thing about it.  The film opens with  an oblique mention of setting, simply put as &quot;The Dawn of Man&quot;.  Here we see a group of early man-monkey hybrids fighting off other wild  animals and another group of enemy monkeys, and generally losing in the  process.  As the next day dawns, the first monkey to waken begins shrieking  in fright.  As the camera pulls back we see that a giant black, rectangular  object has for no obvious reason appeared in the middle of the area in  which they were sleeping.  As the monkeys circle the strange and foreign  structure, on of them touches it.  Later, after the monkeys have left the  object, the same monkey finds a pile of bones.  Remembering the object, the  monkey somehow gets the idea to pick up one of the bones.  As he begins to  hit the other bones, he suddenly realizes what he has found.  The scene  then shifts to the next day.  Enemy monkeys are once again encroaching into  the territory of the monkeys who found the object (which is commonly  referred to as a monolith).  The enemies, however, are shocked when they  find the damage caused by the new weapons which their targets are using.  As they run away, we see the a single monkey fling his bone in the air,  which suddenly changes to a spaceship gently turning.  That's all I'll give  away.The reason that this movie succeeds so well is the fact that its  makers didn't try to turn the story into something that it's not.  They  didn't add any action, and the suspense that does exist is very subtle and  not just cheap thrills.  The pacing of the film is slow in the extreme.  The movie lasts 2hr and 15 min, but only 40 or so minutes have dialogue.  While this would seem to be horribly boring, the lack of dialogue actually  helps.  It allows viewers to get a real sence of how outer space really is.Another great thing about this movie is it's flare for  psychologically intense subject matter.  For instance, throughout the  movie, the two main characters evoke a much less emotional reaction that  the HAL 9000 computer who speaks in a monotone voice and has no real  physical embodiment other than that of a glowing red electronic camera  lens.  Also, there is a definite sense of awe accompanied by the monoliths,  which do nothing but just stand there.  Also, something that I found odd,  when the camera is in space and there is no sound whatsoever, it is almost  impossible for anyone in the room to make a sound.  It takes a huge amount  of will to force any noise throughout most of the movie, as though no one  wants to break the seemingly hypnotic serenity of the scene.Now,  anyone who has seen Kubrik's older works knows that one of the defining  factors of his works have been music.  From the bizarrely cheery theme to  Dr. Strangelove to the chilling &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; of A  Clockwork Orange.  This movie is in no way different.  From the main theme  of &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot; to the light but oddly fitting  &quot;The Blue Danube&quot;, the music in this movie fits the scene  flawlessly every time.  Odd when you consider the fact that most of the  soundtrack was planned to be temporary.  In fact, this soundtrack is  perhaps the best fitting selection I have ever heard.  All in all a proud  entry into the Kubrik Collection.Now, this is the part at which I  would put some of the downsides to this movie.  Well, here goes:  Some  people haven't seen it.  That's the only downside I can find.  Sorry to  dissapoint.  In summation, I would like to offer this:  some things  just can't be described.  The allure and draw of this movie is like that of  a great piece of art.  Though seemingly mundane, if you look beneath the  surface, you may just find something amazing that you never expected to  find.	5.0	A Space Odyssey	2000-08-13	10	9	1

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A12NFK3VGMQYVB	Metalhead74	"Stanley Kubrick was no slouch when it came to making movies. He was a very, very thorough man and took his time in researching his ideas and bringing them to life on screen (Watch ANY of his movies -the common theme being the story unfolds organically, unlike modern films). He knew how to get what he wanted -this film proves that under no uncertain terms.The film was beautifully photographed with each scene being set up perfectly -there were no accidental shots (that I'm aware of) everything was planned carefully. This film was shot, from what I gathered from the special features, between '65 & 68' -1968 being when it was released. Not surprisingly it was panned on release because, well, people didn't get it. They expected a ""space adventure"" with aliens or more excitement. This movie moves at a pace that, if you're more accustomed to modern movies, will make you antsy. Yet it is perfectly paced.The usage of classical music and some modern themes, the stunning special effects (remember this was 1965/68 this movie was filmed in) and the artfully crafted story/plot that almost makes you want to scream at the end ""what the hell does it mean!?"" -you have the right to interpret this movie as that is how Kubrick wanted it. He wanted you involved IN the movie and thinking while watching it -not just sitting back and letting the story unfold and being revealed in the end.This movie is not for those with short attention spans or who get bored easy. You have to dedicate time to watch it. I recommend this to ANYONE who thinks ""Star Wars"" or the other more action oriented space flicks are ""it"". (Nothing against ""Star Wars"", mind you) You must see this movie. It is an experience, no other way to describe it.

Technically it is superb. And the musical score is powerful.But in the many years since then I have become a Christian and now I perceive many evil and anti Christian themes in this film.First it starts out in the murky past proposing we ascended according to the standard evolutionary dogma upward from apes. This is the first lie of the film.Look at the scene of the fight by the water hole. Consider how absurd the evolutionists' claims are. These apes could drink polluted water that would sicken or kill a human being. They also were covered with hair and could live under adverse climatic conditions. What was the supposed ""evolutionary advantage"" of turning into humans with their delicate and fragile constitutions?Second, the film is devoid of Divine Relationship. There is a pervasive overpowering sense of loneliness in this film from beginning to end. The scientists are devoid of human warmth. The only character with any sense of feeling or emotion is the onboard computer that ends up getting disabled due to its murderous intentions towards the human crew members.Third, the black monolith does not fulfill in the slightest the human longing for a loving relationship with our Creator God. If anything, the monolith seems to hearken to Islam's all powerful but inscrutable and capricious god represented by the black rock at Mecca.This film is depressing and devastating.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"The 1968 sci-fi film ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was a revolutionary film for its time and a film classic today.  The screenplay, written by Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick (who also directed the film), was based upon a short story entitled ""The Sentinel"" that Arthur C. Clarke wrote for a BBC competition in 1948.  The story begins some three million years B.C.E. with a group of starving ape-like hominids that were the ancestors of mankind.  Without warning, a mysterious black rectangular monolith appears in their midst.  Clearly the work of some unseen (and vastly more intelligent) alien race, the monolith seemingly inspires the hominids to use bones as weapons for killing animals and eating meat.  It also inspires one of the hominids to kill a rival hominid.  Throwing the deadly bone-weapon into the air, the film suddenly jumps to the year 2001 where a beautiful wheel-shaped space-station is orbiting the Earth and guiding a smaller space vehicle to dock with it.  On board the vehicle is Dr. Heywood R. Floyd (William Sylvester, 1922-1995) who arrives at the space station en route to a base on the moon where American astronauts have discovered a black rectangular monolith buried beneath the lunar surface long before any humans ever set foot on the lunar surface.  When another, but much larger monolith is found by astronomers orbiting Jupiter, a manned interplanetary spacecraft is launched towards Jupiter.  Under the command of Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) with astronaut Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwook), the ship (named ""Discovery"") is controlled by a talking & artificially-intelligent computer known as the HAL 9000 (voice of Douglas Rain); but HAL may not be as flawless as it seems.Produced long before the aid of computer graphics for special effects, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" demonstrated just how real space travel could be shown in film; for which, it was awarded with an Oscar for Best Special Effects.  Beyond special effects, with superb acting and a brilliant plot, the film also earned Oscar nominations for Best Director and Best Screenplay.  It also earned an Oscar nomination for Best Art/Set Direction, though its incredible soundtrack was not nominated.While some today may not appreciate the extraordinary film achievement that ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was, this film is credited for inspiring people such as George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, who, in less than 10 years respectively (and independently) produced the first ""Star Wars"" film and the film ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".  Thus, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" raised the standard of film quality that was raised even higher by subsequent films that were inspired by it. Without question, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" earns a rating 5 out of 5 stars for not only being a superb film on its own, but also for the revolution in the film industry that it started.  Many thanks to Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke and all those who participated in the making of this timeless film classic."	5.0	"""No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information."""	2007-11-06	6	4	2

They have made 'The Shining', 'Full Metal Jacket'(new transfer), and 'Eyes Wide Shut' all 1:85, since that is the theatrical aspect ratio. Kubrick shot full frame for TV showings, and the film would be 'masked' for the 1:85 theatre screen. This is why these last 3 films of his are full frame 1:33 on DVD. This was before widescreen TV, of course. I would have to imagine that if he were still alive he would want home viewers to have the best experience watching his films, and would agree with the widescreen 'masking' to fill the frame/screen, since that's how we saw them in the theatre. Kubrick's assistant has stated that this transfer of '2001' from 70mm is 'stunning'. Along with the extras, c'mon, it's a no-brainer to want this in your collection. The more you see it, the more you see in it. Blu-Ray or HD DVD, I have them both. Can't hardly wait!!UPDATE: The Blu-Ray version that I now have lives up to the anticipation.

This is a cinema masterpiece! And for all the care they took to preserve the film in Blu-Ray, they totally screwed up the behind-the-scenes pieces for the disks. Not only are they simply terribly produced (the music was obviously created by someone on a 1980's Casio Keyboard), the graphics, animation and production 'value' are simply embarrassing about a filmmaker who so heavily influenced other filmmakers like myself, and created a completely new and original visual language for the artform.The next time guys, I'd be happy to produce them for you...for free!	3.0	Feature is a Masterpiece, the Extras are embarrasing!	2012-03-16	4	2	2

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A35CIFO1KX5EMS	Michael Legg	This is one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time.  The movie (directed by Stanley Kubrik) actually manages to capture the tone and the subtle nuances of the novel (2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke) The surface plot of the movie is a simple story about space exploration and the possibility of extra-terrestrial life; but in reality this story is about the nature of mankind itself.  The beginning of the movie deals with the birth of mankind.  What is it, exactly, that separated the first man from the apes?  What separates man from the beasts now?  Clarke uses two rival tribes of apes and exposes one tribe to the Monolith (the alien force of the story) and that tribe becomes subtly something more than beast; eventually using tools to oversome the other tribe.  The rest of the story deals with the evolution of the HAL9000 computer into a sentient being (yes, take one letter from each character in HAL and you get IBM; but Clarke claims that is a coincidence).  What is it that separates advanced computers from man?  HAL has a more defined personality than the crew of the ship he controls.  He becomes more and more human, and seems to experience pride and fear, and he makes mistakes because he is told to lie to the crew.  I can't say more without giving too much away, but I recommend this movie to all science fiction fans.  If you have the time, be sure to read the book too; it is truly a masterpiece.	4.0	A Phenomenon!	2001-05-30	0	0	0

If this film does not instantly touch something deep inside you; if it does not give you the joys and pleasures of wonder and adventure, then you have missed the point. I saw this film in Cinerama fourteen times, as a teenager; it still holds me captured as much today, dispite the dissapointing drawbacks and limitations of the standard television screen. This film is absolutly alive when presented on a screen that emerges the viewer within it. I feel sorry for the generations who have not had the opportunity to experiance it, as such. A must for today's tv viewers, is to read the novel after your first viewing; your second watching will open your eyes!

This is by no means a comedic film, but one very subtly funny moment  involves Dr. Floyd studying the instructions to use the  &quot;zero-gravity&quot; toilet on the moon shuttle...complete with 10  separate steps and hundreds of words of text.The rest of the allusions  to how technology controls our lives are obvious, such as HAL's rebellion  against Discovery's crew.Incredible film, with something new to learn  every time you watch it.	5.0	How man interacts with technology through the ages	2000-05-30	1	1	0

It was one of the first I picked up because of the ten dollar price tag and the good ratings, I figured I didn't have anything to lose. I am impressed with the image quality. It beats out the transfer to blu from Donnie Darko (and countless other newer films.) At any rate, this is a film to sit all the way through, its definitely a mind bender.

It ranks number 15 on the American Film Institutes top 100 movies of all time, which I feel is underrated.  It is in Roger Ebert's top 10 films of all time list, I would recommend reading his ""great movie"" series review on this film.  It is ranked number #80 on imdb's top 250 films of all films in existance, again highly underrated in my opinion.Space Odyssey is a film that you experience there is no rush in action, Kubrick is confident and patient enough to allow the viewer to analyze, experience, and contemplate this puzzle of the evolution of man in our  imaginations, only one filmmaker comes to mind in such a way and that is Werner Herzog.  What better way to experience such a film then in High definition with all those glorious shots bursting off the screen or listen to the classical moving music selected by Kubrick in 5.1 Dolby Digital Plus or a Dts track.This is one if not the greatest film I have ever seen for any genre.  If I did not own an Hd dvd player or a Blu Ray player a title like this would inspire me to do so.  I highly recommend this to anyone.DVD Features:  What I could find on movieweb/ Also describes the 10 dvd set available as well.On October 23, Warner Home Video will launch the first in their new series featuring influential films from some of history's greatest directors.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A17SIT3W0OG6VM	Mike Quinn	"In June of 1968, while visiting my grandparents in Harrisburg, PA (I was 15), my grandmother and I were driving by a local theater whose marquis showed the title of a movie being shown there.  The movie was ""2001: A Space Odyssey""  I had just read an article in Popular Science magazine about the production and, being a very big SF fan, I told my grandmother I wanted to see this movie.  It didn't seem her cup of tea, but she bought me a ticket (75 cents would you believe)and I entered a world I'd never before known.  The astounding good fortune of that day was that the theater that was showing the movie was equipped as a Cinerama theater.  I had never seen a screen so big in my life.  I spent the next two and one half hours having my brain rearranged.Flash forward to the advent of home video.  I have, since that wonderful day in 1968, done everything I have been able to do to maintain contact with that film.  When I got my first copy in video tape, it was Beta.  Then came VHS, then the twenty fifth anniversary edition in VHS, then my current copy, on DVD, which(horror of horrors) became damaged by my mishandling.  I am currently (and breathlessly) awaiting my newest copy from Amazon.  I have yet to upgrade to Blu Ray simply because my home theater system is too new to justify replacement.I have heard all the arguments about the technical shortcomings of 2001 compared to later epics such as Star Wars and the Star Trek films.  All credit where it is due; George Lucas and his contemporaries have long earned their places in film legend.  But, they learned at least part of their craft from the likes of Stanley Kubrick and Douglas Trumbull.  You have to remember that Kubrick et al were working exclusively with photographic film, a medium that is almost never used anymore.  In 1964, when production began, the most powerful computers were exclusively owned by the federal government and wouldn't have been able to power your iPad.  Ask Mr. Lucas and his colleagues about Kubrick and I would be surprised if his work on 2001 didn't influence them at all.  And the critics were scandalized by the fact that the movie cost $10 million to make.  Also bear in mind that the Academy Award winner for best makeup the following year was Planet Of The Apes, reportedly because the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences thought that the characters in the beginning of 2001 were real apes, not the stunt men, dancers and mimes that they were.As to the meaning of the film, I think we're all going to have to accept the fact that it has to be viewed purely subjectively.  I really don't believe that it is possible to justifiably state that some people get it and others don't.  The human race is just way too diverse to make such a short sighted statement.  The best I can say on that subject is, nearly fifty years after that wonderful June day in 1968, I THINK I get it, but everytime I see the film, I'm still asking questions."	5.0	2001: A Space Odyssey (DVD)	2012-12-21	1	1	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1D1MIFRSG50Y3	Mike S.	This is a really good movie, but probably will not be entertaining for everyone.  It touches on many different topics including the origin of life, artificial intelligence and space exploration.  There is not really any action in the movie.  The closest thing to that is when Dave was trying to get back into the ship after HAL locked him out.  It is very much a movie that required you to think more than anything else.  The idea that a computer goes bad and attacks humans is one that would appear later in movies like The Terminator, but what made this version of that story work was how HAL interacted with the other characters.  The movie looks about as good as it possibly can on Blu Ray.  Given how old it is, it will not look as good as newer movies do.  It does have some, but not a ton of extras.  If you are a fan of the movie, and do not own the DVD release this is worth getting.	4.0	A very good movie	2012-12-23	0	0	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AY47ZHXRYRLLF	Mike Treder	Recently I had the immense pleasure of seeing the remastered 70mm version of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; on a huge screen in a New York City theater. There may never have been a more awe-inspiring and magnificent movie.This was my first viewing of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece since I became familiar with the transhumanist movement and the concept of a technological SingularityPreviously, I'd never known quite what to make of the dreamlike, possibly hallucinatory sequence that comprises the final portion of the film. But this time, for the first time, it made a lot of sense to me. The bizarre psychedelic trip that introduces it can be seen to symbolize the dizzying technological ascent we are soon to experience as we approach the Spike. The surreal aging and eventual rebirth of astronaut Dave Bowman can be viewed as a representation of the time when humans fully merge with machines and break away from all physical, spatial, and biological limits.As far as I know, Kubrick never claimed this interpretation. Of course, back in 1968 the concept was hardly well known. However, Alan Turing, John Von Neumann, Richard Feynman and a few others had already started speculating in this direction, and it is certainly possible that Arthur C. Clarke (who worked closely with Kubrick in planning the film) was aware of their ideas.At any rate, I would highly recommend catching this spectacular work of art on the big screen if you get the chance.Happy viewing!	5.0	What is Kubrick trying to tell us?	2002-01-08	10	6	4

Thank god they came out on both formats.  I'm running the Toshiba hd-a2 on a 56"" HD RPTV so details and compression show up so if I'm a little critical, don't worry about watching it on smaller lcd/plasmas as it will look fantastic.The video is (excuse the phrase) in a different world than the remastered SD dvd.  Thank god.  I was worried that this would be a transfer they did a few years ago, they pass it off to the disc and it wouldn't hold up to more recent VC-1 transfers (it's VC-1).  But from the opening scenes you can see a major difference from the, now junky, SD version.  I give it 4 stars because it is not a total ""all out"" reworked film/dvd like Lucas did with the star wars special edition dvd's (all digitally color corrected & cleaned, etc- & there's a purists' point of view in there I won't go into for this review).  The HD DVD of 2001 has its limits from the source material but when it's good- it's amazing.  I personally enjoy the ""feel/look"" of a HD version of a film from 1968 rather than a weird pristine, digitally enhanced ""2007 looking"" version of a 1968 film.The beginning sunsets (landscapes) are much better but the first scene of the primate/humans around the watering hole is where I said ""oh ya"".  You can see so much more detail and sharpness in the dirt around the water.  There are scenes of the moon that still have an annoying green cast on the edges. The scene that used to be horrible on the SD version, were the red chairs in the space station when Floyd talks with the Russians.  They had horrible ""jaggies""  and weren't smooth at all in the background on the SD version.  Now they are gloriously sharp and curved.  Much more detail.  When landing on the moon- you can now make out scratches/texture in the plastic buttons in the landing craft cabin.  Most of the other scenes are improved as you would expect.  Another memorable HD part is the end in the ""room"" when he looks in the mirror.  You can now see the painted texture of the helmet- all the detail in his face and the helmet's ""face shield"" shows off dust or a smudge here or there.  Just fantastic resolution compared to the old remastered SD version.  There's still some jitter in the film here and there but nothing major.  Overall- it looks great in HD.The audio is not much different than the SD version.  Again; source material.  I have to settle for the DD+ soundtrack.  A common complaint I have of a bunch of HD discs is that they seem to be recorded at a lower audio level than their SD counterparts.  I frequently have to turn the volume up more on HD versions of flicks than the SD ones and it's the same for 2001.  Not bad though- just turning the volume up.  It may be in my head- but I may like the DD track off the SD version a hair better than the DD+ on the HD disc.  The DD+ track sounds a little smoother or less dynamic then the old one- but don't fret over it- I'm a hi-fi guy that puts too much time into that kind of thing.Overall- don't expect a total digital cleaning of the film but if you're wondering if it's worth the double dip from the SD version, upsampled, to the HD version (Bluray or HD) than the answer is definately YES !!  Some of the scenes I mentioned alone, blow the SD version away."	4.0	HD DVD Quality Review only....	2007-10-24	15	13	2

So much so that I now write SciFi (check out Rome's Revolution available on Amazon).  2001 was one of the most important events in my life because it was the first time a book was translated to a movie version with the craft and care worthy of the source material.  The Blu-ray transfer is awesome and makes the movie even more enjoyable.  There are several extra pieces and my brother is featured in one of them!

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2XVA2OGDYKKD	Monsieur Valentine	They dont make movies like this anymore, and that might be fine, but tell me how many times you have seen a parody of this film as a testament to its lasting visceral impact. This is an eloquent motion picture that resonates in every sense. It is an inspiration to film making. It might be obsolete in some ways, but when I watch this film I feel so engrossed in the free reign of one creator. This movie isnt about the actors, or even the story. Its a stage for Kubrick (a brilliant mind) to explore his profession in ways no one in his position is now free to do. Its truly a space odyssey. And the drawn out scenes help to imprint this landscape.A tighter movie could have done the ape scene in 2 minutes, but would have failed to express the momentous evolution of that scene. Equally the drawn out scenes of the spinning pen and the floating ships are a deliberate attempt to create the notion of infinity in space. By manipulating our impatience as viewers, Kubrick converges space and time as an emotion. Expansive, wonderous, infinite and yes slow.	5.0	Put back into words	2009-07-26	3	3	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2HYMA3BGE9ZHH	Motion Picture DP	In regards to the uneducated 2.35:1 zealot reviewer, as a Director of Photography, I can state unequivocally that 2001 is supposed to be in 2.20:1 aspect ratio. It was shot in 2.20:1. It was not shot in Cinemascope (or anamorphic Panavision), which is 2.35:1.  It was shot with straight lenses in Super Panavision 70 (65mm negative, 70mm projection print with soundtrack). Super Panavision 70 is a 2.20:1 aspect ratio format. When you are watching a 70mm print in a theater you are watching 2.20:1, which was never as wide as the anamorphic formats. Learn your aspect ratios.Not to mention the fact that Kubrick went to the extraordinary effort of exposing his special effects composite shots as successive passes on the original undeveloped 65mm negative (after it being held sometimes in refrigeration for up to a year or more waiting for the next pass) so that all the composite visual elements are first generation on the original camera negative, rather than the cheaper and more common optical composite dupe negative inserts.  Amazing.  That is why it looks as good as it does.  No optical negative generations.A Beautiful Film...and one of the best executions of the 70mm format ever.A true Visual Masterpiece.	5.0	Learn Your Aspect Ratios	2007-10-23	1136	1026	110

Kubrick was kind enough to shoot the movie on 70MM film as if he knew we'd be watching movies on gigantic hi-def TVs in our homes one day. Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood provide an entertaining commentary track, but oddly, they weren't sitting together as they recorded the track. I'm surprised by this as many of us have seen them together at autograph shows. In any case, the commentary track provides us with many behind the scenes stories as if they have been talking about this movie ever since it was released (which is most diffidently the case).

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ	Mr. A. Pomeroy	You know the film. I'm reviewing this particular DVD release. Don't expect the world. You're essentially getting the film and the soundtrack for slightly more money than it costs to buy both separately. There's a big silver box and some extra stuff, but none of it's worth anything or particularly interesting - the booklet is hardly 'Filming the Future' and the limited-edition serotype is a small piece of card with a 70mm film frame glued into it. There's a trailer but no other extra bits, and I can only assume all the quotes in the reviews below about how the picture and sound quality are excellent are mistaken, because the picture quality is poor at best. The whole film has been squashed into one layer of a single side of a single DVD, and in places the compression is very bad - space is full of dark compression artifacts which hop about, lights and sunlight have chunky halos around them, and there are lots of flaws in the original negative (the intertitles, for example), which aren't corrected. It's worth mentioning the menu, too - it's garish and looks like a children's cartoon. Should you buy this? If you want 2001 on DVD, you don't have much choice. I have no idea if the other version that's out there is any better.	2.0	Great film, poor DVD	2001-06-25	49	39	10

It is the exact opposite of a popcorn movie where explosions and sex keep your interest.  Here, you are required to indulge into the film and really try and decipher whats going on.  The pace is very slow but exciting things are happening the whole time.I have become a huge fan of this movie and applaud Kubrick for making it. It breaks all the rules and puts the owness on the viewer to explain whats happening. This film has several interpretations some of which are religious and others which are purely meta-physical. It is a journey of mankinds destiny and his place among the stars and heavens.Your best bet is to watch this with patience and concentration. It tells its story through sound and image rather than straight dialog which there is not much of.The special effects hold up to or look BETTER than most CGI crap today and there are no details left out. Space has never looked or felt so real and this was in 1968 folkks!  The soundtrack is also perfect and compliments the film very well.What else can I say?  See it. Experience it. Its the kind of film that still gets discussed and argued about even now. Most films are forgotten about the minute you leave your theatre seat!Those that claim its boring or making no sense are best served to cue up their favorite action flick as to not ask much of their conscience or attention span.A Masterpiece of film-making.	5.0	Great film, technical marvel & thought provoking....	2006-10-29	7	6	1

I would agree that the dvd Collector's Edition could have had more extras.  The bottom line is the quality of the visual and auditory presentation.  According to Widescreen Review, both are improvements over the previous DVD releases.  This movie is not for everyone -- if you read the Amazon reviews you'll see what I mean! If you want to experience this film, this collector's DVd will give you what you are looking for.  I found the images crisp and the sound much better than expected.  Remember, this is a film made in the late 60's!!  The special effects still stand up to anything seen today!  I've seen quotes from George Lucas... he agrees!  If you can stay through the entire movie, you will be treated to 3, 4, or 5 of the finest sequences in the history of film!

So I guess the only way to enjoy a good movie like this is to, I know this is tough but please give it a try.........use your imagination. Imagination is a wonderful gift that distinguishes humans from being just animals.That is probably why people like Charlie Chaplin, Orsen Wells, Tim Burton, Martin Scorcese, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Franic Ford Coppola and of course Stanley Kubrick made their movies because they had imagination. They are not limited to what they see or what they can never be able understand fully.Obviously people who gave this movie a bad review grew up in a rich family, lived in nice little suburbia, and whose only idea of having fun is snorting cocaine or drinking hard liquour and telling the same sex jokes over and over again.If your going to watch your teen party movies like American Pie, Road Trip, Old School, Van Wilder, Animal House or whatever the h3ll they are, dont waste your time bashing a masterpiece like 2001, because your only making yourself look more ridiculous.....hmmmm actually I dont even think you could sink much lower.	5.0	Wonderful Artist's Vision	2005-05-25	4	2	2

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1MKFYZZ2X46RA	"""mythologue"""	If Kubrick's masterpiece is still widely written about, it's because its nature is less explanatory (which is the case of A.C. Clarke's interesting but vastly inferior novel) than evocative. Whereas Clarke's work is filtered through a precise point of view (that of Clarke himself), Kubrick's is open to countless such readings since he chooses not to add up hints that would lead viewers to a clear conclusion. Here, I'd like to offer a neoplatonic interpretation of the film. `2001' could be said to show the limits of knowledge derived from the senses (here represented by the overwhelming technology), through an highly critical portrait of someone who might qualify as the most expressive symbol of domination - domination of space and time, literally --, the astronaut. Of a man whose growing familiarity with usually unseen realms have numbed, even annihilated his sense of wonder. This blas&eacute; conqueror is ultimately betrayed by the technology he himself helped to devise (HAL), but far from a complete disaster, it is a new beginning: it forces him to abandon the `spirit of conquest' that had guided him; unlike his colleagues, but much like the apes, he does not -- and can't -- envision the monolith as a priced possession, and it brings him closer to his true origin. This new man, free from reflexes that had hindered him previously, now goes beyond mere `positive' knowledge and is more receptive; he thus can be in contact with what he really is through gnosis (the film's `last act'). Needless to say, this is merely one possible reading among numerous others... essential viewing.	5.0	A neoplatonic interpretation...	2003-07-31	1	1	0

The physics of the space craft and station, rotating in perfect coordination, illustrates how much attention was payed to keeping the 'science' in science fiction.Perfectly scored and filmed with dramatic and yet somehow understated camera work (a halmark of director Kubrick) it combines the hardest of science with the fanciful portrayal of humanity's first (and ultimately meaningless) interaction with intelligence greater than our own.It also introduces Hal, the murderous, strangely passive super computer, represented by a simple, blinking red light that is able to portray more malice than most human actors.A triumphant film, boned up on real 'science,' and with one of the most memorable villains in sci-fi film, Kubrick once again demonstrates his dominance as a director.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	When I was younger, no matter how much I tried, I couldn't get into 2001: A Space Odyssey.  I found it unbelievably boring, could make no sense of it, and frankly, could barely make it halfway through the film.  It wasn't until sometime later, after I had grown an appreciation for meaningful films (particularly Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange among others), that I decided to give 2001 another chance.  And I was ever so thankful I did.  Forty years later, 2001 remains a bold and poetic science fiction opus that paints a picture of the relationship between man and the universe, a visual poem that begs the question of who we are and where are we going.  The film's prime narrative, namely the struggle between two astronauts (Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood) and the malfunctioning supercomputer HAL 9000, only serves as a relatively minor plot point in the grand scheme of Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke's story, and remains possibly the best depiction of a struggle of man and machine to ever be filmed.  Films like 2001 simply aren't made anymore, an idea made all the more true thanks to the fact that the film has stood the test of time four decades later, and remains a stunning, powerful, and haunting achievement.  This Two-Disc Special Edition offers the film in a brilliant transfer (even for a standard definition release), and worthwhile extras that detail the journey that Kubrick and Clarke underwent for the film to be conceived.  Yes, 2001 is a film that requires patience when viewing, particularly in these modern times of huge explosions, digital effects, and shallow plots; but make no mistake that it is a science fiction opus for the ages, and will remain a classic until the end of time itself.	5.0	A stunning and timeless masterpiece	2008-07-01	2	2	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A24GLNOGCWICTP	Neil Cotiaux	"The late Stanley Kubrick essentially redefined the historic approach to moviemaking with this, one of my Top 5 picks of all time. A groundbreaking, sweeping paean to human potentiality, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" goes beyond the basic framework of the timeless Greek epic, not only in terms of updating the hero's foes (manmade technology and the inherent incomprehensibility of the universe vs. geographic separation from home and an assortment of mythic creatures) and asks the viewer to step back from his everday life and, if only briefly, ponder the vastness of creation and humankind's place in it.It is clear from Kubrick's construction of ""2001"" that he worships man's place in the universe and hopes for him (her) an ever-greater growth of intellectual and spiritual understanding.Intellectual growth is captured in the film by the trademark opening sequence that catapults man from ape-like existence to space traveler and later, in a more ominous manner, by framing man's innate curiosity and mental prowess within the context of a challenge from his own creation (HAL. Man wins).Spiritual growth is at the core of this odyssey, manifested by symbols of man's passion to feed his soul through great music (much of the soundtrack), great design (the Versailles-like setting that sets the stage for death and the emergence of the Star Child) and the hushed reverence given to the Monolith when it is encountered.Kubrick does not end his film with the Star Child outsizing the Earth for nothing; he is saying that man is capable of infinite growth, accomplishment and even wisdom if he will only ""write on the blank slate"" that is presented to him (her), tabula rasa, at the moment of birth. The sequence concludes with the welling of the ""Also Sprach"" theme and a very resonant organ peal, underscoring the inherently spiritual if not overtly religious overtone of the entire film.""You take back your spirit, they die, returning to the dust. You send forth your spirit, they are created, you renew the face of the earth."""	5.0	A Clean Slate	2006-06-16	4	4	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2UNZU69OZRRJX	"Nelson R. Willis ""Rob Willis"""	What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said by all the other fanatics who agree with me?  Seeing it in a theatre is an amazing experience, but watching this video edition at home with the lights off was  a wonderfully close second; just make sure to watch it with good  audio-video equipment to maximize the effect!  More than one of the  greatest works of audio-visual science fiction, this is one of the very  great classic films in the history of cinema.  This is a brillianly  fruitful result of a collaboration between Arthur C. Clarke -- one of the  great minds in science and science fiction -- and Stanley Kubrick -- one of  the world's great film makers.Science fiction is always much better  when written by a scientist than when it is not.  This film portrays  interplanetary space travel in a much more believable way than do so many  other science fiction adventure films.  There are no loud explosions in a  vaccum, there are no Anglophonic apes or aliens, and thank God for  that!The silence of space is made more pleasant by a great score of  classical and experimental music.  This soundtrack is matched perfectly  with the incredible cinematography.  This movie takes its time in  developing its themes, so it is frankly for thinking people with good  attention spans whose minds are not turned to blubber by the rapid fire  editing of rollercoaster ride angles as seen in MTV videos.  It is the  film's very subtlety and understatement in terms of its pace, acting,  action, etc. which gives it its awsome power.  As long as you are willing  to pay attention and soak it in, it is breathtaking, staggering,  mind-boggling, and conciousness expanding, but not boring.Much of its  plot and meaning are mysterious and ambiguous, and that provokes much  thought and discussion among members of its audience long (I mean weeks,  months, years) after the actual viewing of it.  I've seen the film many  times, including this video version at least twice, and it still impresses  and amazes me and my friends and family.  The attention to detail, science,  and special effects was so far above par for its time and so ahead of its  time (production was in the mid to late 60s), that many films which  followed for years after were released in its shadow.  Even its portrayal  of the distant past (in the first part of the film) was absolutley  remarkable in its realism.Though useage of dialogue, action, character  interaction, and conflict is sparse in this film, each is used very  powerfully at times.  Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood are each respectively  excellent as Mission Commander Dr. David Bowman and Astronaut Dr. Frank  Poole.  While I can't remember who does the voice of on-board computer HAL  9000, this voice's effect was perfect in its blend of eerieness and calm,  soothing pleasantness.  The dynamic interactions between these three  characters, and the manner in which their interrelationships move from  routine harmony, to tension, to all-out conflict creates one of my favorite  cinematic subplots.  Out of the ensuing conflict and crises, the Bowman  character emerges as a hero of remarkable courage, resolve, and  resourcefulness, but disarming humanity.  Even the machine HAL is a  convincingly humanoid (psychologically, that is) character who displays  charactarisics ranging from kindness, to curiosity, to paranoia, to  ruthlessness, to fear.I highly recommend this film and/or video.	5.0	A monumental milestone in the history of cinema.	1999-01-22	1	1	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A173G0GN4479RG	"NEO-CS- ""Cyber Soldier"""	I cannot say that Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey is either a great or horrible film. It is only good at best. Keep in mind when watching this, that this movie was made in 1968...32 years ago. The imagery used for this time period would have been ground breaking to say the least.Kubrick, as he has done in his other films, used imagery to set this movie apart from all others. You will notice the contrasting yet vivid colors in many scenes throughout the film. The classical music certainly helped the feel of this movie and was a nice touch.The problem with this film lies in its slow pace. You better drink some coffee before seeing this one. You will waddle through 26 minutes before any dialogue is heard (unless you count the grunts and groans of the apemen in the inital sequence.)Overall, when finishing this 2 hour 20 minute marathon you will either love or hate this film. Its a trippy, psychadelic look at First Contact, made in an era when space exploration was as close of a reality as Home Computers, or VCR's. This one is by far for the Science Fiction fans, all others may want to rent this one first!	3.0	This movie is kind of strange!	2000-08-09	2	0	2

The commentaries are worthless, but the movie looks great. I was too young when I watched this film for the first time and didn't understand it. Rewatching it on Blu-ray, I was riveted from beginning to end. Some of the effects shots (Heywood Floyd asleep on the shuttle, with his pen floating in the aisle, for example), have probably never been bettered, and one is struck by the audacity of Kubrick to have tried such a project. So much of it was without precedent, in the plot, the pacing, the effects, the casting. An extraordinary accomplishment.For those who find the movie confounding, I suggest reading or watching the movie version of 2010. While this may seem like throwing good money after bad, the two works complement each other well, and most of the mysteries of 2001 are explained in a straightforward manner in the sequel (also in their wikipedia pages, but that sucks all the art out of the story).	5.0	The best Blu-ray I own	2012-03-25	4	3	1

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2BVBJ1X9TRGAS	niagarajeff	2001 bores some people, while I see incredible complexity of multiple stories overlaid: the origin of man's critical thinking, an optimistic view of the future, a version of how man's first contact would take place, as well as the failure of man to be able to control his machines.  Any of these stories alone would be interesting; that they can all be drawn together remarkable.  Classic Kubrick is the man/machine element as HAL takes over the ship, an element he explored in Dr. Strangelove also, and again with disasterous results.  The vision of the sublime future (Ho Jo's and ATT on the space station) has always been the biggest lure to me, the wonderment of what could be if we would put more money in space than we do in military.  The details of Kubrick movies are always immense, no part is accidental or unintentioned.  Watch 2001 20 times, you will see things you never saw before.  This is the best movie of all time in my book.  It also is sad for several reasons, some profound: Kubrick is gone and so is his magic, the future he foresaw will probably never happen (at least for Pan Am it won't!), and unfortunately we will never be able to see this in Cinerama again.  Enjoy the DVD, it's the best you will be able to do!

So, what happens when you put it on after a 15 year gap from the last time you saw it? Well, what really hits home is just how good the opening sequence in which the ape-men discover ""knowledge"" is. Beautifully photographed, meticulously designed (just how did they make those ape suits look so genuine?), superbly ""acted"" and wholly effective - so much so that you really do feel you're there at ""The Dawn of Man"". And while large parts of what follows have inevitably dated, albeit a great deal less than any other contemporary ""vision of the future"" film, this first 15 minute sequence remains as fresh and grippingly believable as the day it was made... worth the effort of renting it, or dusting down your old copy, just to marvel at it once again.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2S87YDVQF0T5Q	Nielsen	"Well, I finally forced myself to watch this movie. It was hard, and I didn't particularly like it, but I do appreciate it. Kubrick definitely is not in a hurry in this film (the first line of dialogue is 25 minutes in). It's the kind of film that half an hour in, you feel like strangling somebody (if you're not asleep yet). I don't do this to discredit the talent of the filmmaker. I'm assuming it was his intent. It sure plays out that way.Yet, as a film student, I am somehow impressed by the film. While I hope I don't ever have to watch the whole thing beginning to end again any time soon, I was impressed by 1: the intriguing jump cut from the bone to the spaceship, and 2: the sense of grandiose and the filmmaker's ability to actually produce something so slow paced that still somewhat holds together.I wouldn't recommend this film to the casual viewer. But film lovers should see it at least once. It's art. There are abstract artists like Rothko whose art I wouldn't call particularly beautiful, but it's still considered inventive art. Then there are more realism artists like Rembrandt: more pleasing, but still a different style of art. Think of ""2001"" as very abstract art like Rothko. And think of (as a previous reviewer suggested) ""The Matrix"" as Rembrandt. (OK, that's a stretch on insulting Rembrandt, but maybe it'll prove my point)Again, I did not particularly enjoy this film, but I appreciate having seen it."	4.0	Artistically interesting	2004-09-05	5	3	2

It reminds me of a rental VHS tape that has been played a few too many times.  The trailers are presented with more care and respect.  This is not at all a tribute to Stanley's work.The audio was digitally remastered which does add something to the experience.  We can be thankful for that.Overall, I have to recommend the film because of the vision and philosophy it contains, but the anniversary edition on VHS looks much better.  This is a movie that is very much dependent on the visuals to understand what is happening.  The DVD version fails in this regard.	3.0	Great Film, Bad DVD	2001-03-20	3	2	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	It's incorrect to say that Keir Dullea stars in director, Stanley Kubrick's &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. He's just not in the film very much.  Perhaps the only real constant is the HAL computer, a diabolical monitoring system that will do anything for its own self preservation and that includes killing the humans who built it.  There's no simple way to sum up all of the parts that make this movie the ultimate sci-fi classic.  Special effects are so many light years ahead of their time that nearly a half a century later this film continues to visually hold up.  The end (no, for those who've never seen it, I won't ruin it) will provoke endless discussion around your dinner table. WARNING: Those of you expecting something along the lines of either &quot;Star Wars&quot; or &quot;The Day The Earth Stood Still&quot; will be bitterly disappointed.  For all those with open minds, step forward and be amazed.Warner Home Video previously issued this disc in a really disappointing transfer.  I am pleased to say that oversight has been rectified.  The newly remastered edition is something of a revelation, with stark contrast levels, color fidelity and soundtrack remastering all exhibiting exemplary clarity, fidelity and pristine qualities.  Still, we don't get a documentary on the making of this classic or any other extra features for that matter.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1TRWW665ACYQ3	n.m.	"If you look at 2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY from a craftman's point of view, then there's no denying that Kubrick was able to direct one of the finest films ever put together. It ranks right up there with Griffith's BIRTH OF A NATION, Eisenstein's POTEMKIN, and Orson Welle's CITIZEN KANE. Each shot in the film is manipulated down to the tiniest element. The lighting is perfect. The scene with Dave and Frank plotting against HAL 9000, inside the spacepod, with the inserted shots of HAL 9000's ""red eye"" and the lipmoving of the two astronauts, is brilliant. And how many directors can manage to insert a cut that skips about four million years of evolution and at the same time comments on the time that passed?Actually, the four-million-years-cut (supposedly the longest ""fast forward"" cut in filmhistory) is a fascinating part of the film, and it illustrates the different takes that Clarke and Kubrick had on the story. Arthur C. Clarke is a man that believes in evolution. He feels that progress and technology will introduce better times ahead. Stanley Kubrick is the complete opposite, a notorious evolution-pessimist. When we see the ape-man toss the bone up in the air, after that violent dispute over the waterwhole, Kubrick speeds forward and cuts to a spacecraft which in shape and form resembles the bone. I think it's likely that Clarke intended this to be a positive comment on evolution. The bone is thrown high up in the air (illustrating man rising upwards, which is positive) and then we cut to the spaceship, which becomes an hommeage to the spaceage (and man's brilliance). But Kubrick has managed to flip the coin and turn it around; As the film is, man may have technologically evolved light-years beyond the ape-stage, but in a sense we're still there.People often complain that the symbology of the black monolith isn't clear enough (curse your average Hollywood film for creating an audience that feels it has to understand all things at all times). I believe that's just the point. Stanley Kubrick rarely made comments on his films, but he did say this about 2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY; ""How can you describe a supirior intelligence with an infirior intelligence?"" Clearly the monolith is somewhat of a ""gift"" from an alien entity. It imbues man with intelligence and allows him to progress unto the next level of evolution. But 2001... never shows man at the final stage - the ""star child"" is just another step further up the ladder (or possibly down, if you're a pessimist) - because in evolution there can be no final stage, and how can we then possibly know what the black monolith is? People often deem 2001... of being pretentious. How can that be? Wouldn't pretentious be to attempt to explain what the monolith is?Obviously, there are numerous references to Friedrich Nietzche. This is sort of a personal theory of mine, but the film can be seen as an analogy to the German philosopher's most famous work, THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA (after all, the famous theme of the film, by Johan Strauss, is titled ALSO SPRACH ZARATHUSTRA). Nietzche saw man as being in a constant state of evolution. The primal level is the beast, which in the film could be the ape-men. The final level (it's inaccurate to describe it as the final level, but it's what comes closest) is the ""ubermench"" (or ""superman""), which could be the ""star child"". Here, man has finally broken free from his environment, represented in the film as the final demise of technology, with the disconnection of HAL 9000.I would like to point out a tiny detail at this time, to show how well thought through the film really is; One of the famous scenes of the film is where Frank plays a game of chess against HAL 9000; A classic battle of human intellect versus artificial intellect. HAL 9000 check-mates Frank by moving ""Queen to Bishop three. Bishop takes Queen. Knights takes Bishop,"" Without hardly a glance at the chessboard, Frank resigns. But HAL 9000 has actually made an error. He should have said Queen to Bishop six, and not three. He used the wrong notational viewpoint. Then later in the film, when the calculations of HAL 9000 aren't compatible with the calulations of a twin HAL 9000 on earth, Frank asks HAL 9000 whether there has ever been a computer error with the 9000 series, ""even the most insignificant computer error?"" HAL 9000 confidentely replies, ""None, whatsoever, Frank,""2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY is a film that asks more questions than it answers. But that's exactly what makes it so fascinating. It's no fun to watch a film that tells you everything (that's certainly the sure sign of a pretentious film). By only asking the questions, 2001... becomes one of the few films that are truly thought provoking. It forces you to think simply because you have to. I always get a bit frustrated about people who shrug their shoulders and complain that ""they didn't understand a thing"". Well, think, damn it! Do you like it when people feed you the answers they claim are right? I'm tired of films that proposes to have the answer to everything.2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY is Stanley Kubrick's finest moment. It's a landmark in all aspects of filmmaking. I've seen it more times than I know (I spendt my last two and a half hours of 2001 watching it; It was a beautiful moment when the camera zoomed in on the black monolith at the end, Johan Strauss' ALSO SPRACH ZARATHUSTRA started playing, and I saw the ""star child"" floating through the galaxy, and then we went from 2001 to 2002). I will never tire of this film. Luckily a local cinema is going to put it up in the theatres next month, and I will finally get to experience it on the big screen! 2001... is just about the best piece of cinematic expirience there is!"	5.0	just about the best piece of cinema there is	2002-01-25	12	9	3

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A5MUGRY5F2A70	Nonfiction Reader	I watched this movie twice. Then I read the reviews and the interpretation of the movie on Wikipedia, which I advise for anyone wondering what they just watched if they don't want to read a book.I like the ideas behind the movie, but I have to admit I got lost trying to figure out elements in the details, which made me miss the big picture. If there were a few shots added to the film that explained a little more, then it wouldn't have left me perplexed on minor things.First, I kept thinking I was seeing the same monolith not four different ones. I still don't know why the moon monolith was buried. It wasn't buried on Earth. Wouldn't it have been just as fascinating to simply find it standing on the moon's surface? Then the moon monolith making a horrible noise seemed like it didn't want anyone touching it rather than it being a signal that man made it to the moon.The next problem was the change in characters from Frank to Dave. I kept wondering when Frank was going to reappear, since the film focused on him after the ape intro, and he's contemporary to Dave.Then Dave makes it to Jupiter. Something happens to him without his touching the outer space floating monolith. Then did he take the monolith back to a hotel room on a space station similar to what Frank was on? Was he rapidly aging or was he there for decades? Was it all happening in his head while the lights were flashing in his eyes? Wikipedia stated that Clarke's book explained that the alien monolith picked up transmissions of how man lived at that point in time and had created an alien zoo to house Dave in - this part of the story was completely skipped in the movie.Then Dave dies, and a giant space baby appears. Where did the hotel/zoo go? Again, it's minor questions like these that left me confused.The movie doesn't transition between parts very well. The best transition was from bone to spaceship, showing man's evolution from animal to space explorers, but I even missed that the first time watching it.Viewers complain about the slow pace of the movie, but the slow parts basically show how space travel might be for the common man - something we still have yet to achieve. The quietness of space is also there. In fact, most of our senses become useless in space. You can't touch it, smell it, taste it, or hear it. Even visually, you see mostly darkness. The low occupancy of the ships reflects this vastness of space and just how insignificant we are in the universe.Overall, it's a very thought provoking film. It just needs a few more dots connected. Maybe if they had edited out the parts that we understand without watching the same thing for 10 minutes like the flashing lights sequence and put in things that really do need an explanation as I mentioned above, it would've been perfect.	3.0	Didn't See the Forest for the Trees	2012-06-03	7	2	5

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3F1TGEKJ86WKR	N. W. Clayton	"I first saw ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" at the age of 12 in a grand old movie palace that had been retrofitted with a Cinerama screen and projector.  It was one of the great entertainment experiences of my life.  After the film's initial run, the only way I was able to view it was on scratched-up 16mm or 35mm prints at a discount rerun theater or college auditorium, then on pan-and-scan VHS tape, then on the poorly-mastered first DVD release, then on the somewhat better subsequent DVD with anamorphic standard-definition.  None of these came close to recapturing the original cinematic experience.  But the new HD-DVD release does.  It's like going back 40 years in time to the grand Cinerama palace (which is now a flea market).Many (perhaps most) of the reviews on this page pertain to one of the standard-definition DVD versions, not to the HD-DVD disc, which was just recently released.  For those of you who are not yet familiar with high-definition technology, please be warned that the HD-DVD version will not play on a standard DVD player.  You'll need an HD-DVD player connected to your HDTV via an HD-compatible cable such as HDMI, DVI, or analog component video.  However, if you get an HD-DVD player you'll still be able to use it to play your old standard-def DVDs and audio CDs.I currently have a 4-year-old Sony 42"" Grand Wega high-definition LCD rear-projection TV with 720p resolution, which by now is quite obsolete.  Nonetheless, the picture quality of the ""2001"" HD-DVD, played on my Toshiba HD-A1 player over a DVI cable, is absolutely jaw-dropping.  The HD-DVD version is mastered in the correct aspect ratio in which the movie was originally filmed.  You have the option of selecting the new Dolby TrueHD soundtrack, which is losslessly encoded on the disc.  If your system is set up to handle TrueHD sound, you'll notice a big improvement in the quality of the musical score.  The dialog (what little of it there is) remains slightly fuzzy, perhaps due to the limitations of movie-set audio recording equipment in the mid-1960s.  How they managed to clean up the music track so well, I don't know.  But it sounds phenomenal.And there are a lot of great extra features on the HD-DVD version, most of which are not to be found on either of the two DVD versions that I own.  The main movie and all of the extra features fit on a single HD-DVD disc, so you don't have to hassle with multiple discs.  The disc includes just the right amount of extra material, too, in my opinion.  Enough to be highly satisfying but not so much as to overwhelm (i.e. they didn't pad it with a lot of junk, as sometimes happens with special collectors' editions).My next step will be to purchase a 60"" - 70"" HDTV with 1080p resolution and 120 Hz refresh rate, capable of accepting a 1080p/24 input signal.  I'm currently looking at this one:Sony Bravia SXRD KDS-60A3000 60"" 1080p Rear Projection HDTV.  1080p/24 is the format in which the HD-DVD disc is actually encoded, to match the original 24 frames per second of the film.  On my current setup, the HD-DVD player converts the 1080p/24 signal to 1080i/60, which then gets converted to 720p/60 by my TV.  So I'm not quite at home-theater nirvana yet.  When I get there, I'll invite a select group of friends over to re-live the big-screen 2001 experience."	5.0	A Review of the HD-DVD Version	2007-11-10	9	8	1

Secondly, there is a surreal style to this film that deliberately rips your mind free from its safe and established preconceptions. I didn't &quot;get it&quot; at first- and I'm sure that there are some people who still don't. I've heard people say that this film has &quot;continuity problems&quot; for the way it deliberately makes jarring jumps from the stone age, to a space shuttle, to the jupiter mission, and to &quot;beyond infinity.&quot; Kubrick designed it that way to point out the huge and jarring differences between primitive man, technological man, and man &quot;reborn through space flight.&quot;This is not a boring or trivial film, You're forced to think about what it means.

If it is not Kubrick, I would  stop at the first 15 minutes.  For the first 30 minutes, there were hardly  any dialogue at all, just music.

For example, it spent more than 20 minutes on Dr Lloyd's call to his daughter and Frank's parents to him. One of the two should be removed completely and the other one significantly shortened, as they have nothing to do with the storyline.Prob #2, it takes about 40 minutes, to carry out a very simple plot -- some astronauts find the same thing unknown on the Moon. Those long talks between Dr Lloyd and special agents and his colleagues are really nonsense, and distracting audience from the story line. I would assume a real master such as Steven Spielberg, or Alfred Hitchcock, could have handled it in a much much better and graceful way.Prob #3, I agree with others that the story line is only semi-developed, and the ending is severely unfinished. Yes if you read the book you know the story better. BUT, that's the problem, a good movie should be a self-contained artwork itself, not force people to read another book to understand it.All in all, the movie just pretends to be ""deep"" and should be embarrassed in front of a real masterpiece."	1.0	some big big problems in it	2002-12-01	43	10	33

Why are the only people who can go to it a trained few? Why has noone ever left earth's orbit? Why have we not touched the moon for over 25 years? Why are there only small video cameras on less than 1% of PCs, and everyone else stuck with voice telephones? Why is our &quot;state-or-the-art Artificial Intelligence&quot; a few phrases repeated over and over again, with true thinking and learning out of the question? Why has so little happened since 1968?I do not completely understand the answers to any of these, but I cannot put the questions out of my mind. Still, it's the greatest film ever made, and no film will ever be made that is greater. I just pray that one day we will achieve Kubrick and Clarke's vision.	5.0	It depresses me seeing it now	2001-06-02	5	2	3

Fair enough. It does tax the modern attention span-and, unlike, say the Matrix, requires one to think a bit (full disclosure-I am one of those rare Americans who did not think the Matrix lived up to the hype).The fabulous thing about 2001 is that, while dated, it presents a world that we might actually want to live in. The mysterious &quot;other beings&quot; in this critic's eyes, are there to present a &quot;new age&quot; (cringe-it's the only term I could think of) to Humankind. What a wonderful, mysterious, and uplifting cinematic conceit. Much, much more positive than the facile Post-Modernism of the Matrix (and more positive than Ridley Scott's masterpiece, Blade Runner).It has dated wonderfully, and as noted by other posters, still continues to amaze . For those who remain  unconvinced, trek to your local art-house cinema and watch it on the big screen. I have been privileged to see it twice on a actual Cinerama screen. Wow!Btw-for the younger set, this is the movie that convinced George Lucas that he could actually create realistic Sci Fi movies. Star Wars owes a major debt to this movie and it's director.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	"It is more than possible to view this film now as a cheeky attempt by Kubrick to tell us all what the meaning of life is. For one person to come out and say he knows it all is a positively clinical case of insanity. There is no doubt that Kubrick's intention was just that - however these intentions are entirely overwhelmed by the cinema that he used to convey ""his"" message. You end up not giving a damn about what the man set out to say and instead just lush about in all his film's technical and photographic wonders.It is a film of three parts. The first is about Neanderthal man's coming of age. This is represented by warring ape clans that one day find a dark black Monolith standing in the sand dunes. They touch the monolith with their NAKED hands. The Monolith evolves the apes who proceed to start to use bones as weapons to win their war. The end of this sequence involves the #1 classic ""match cut"" of all time as a bone in the air suddenly becomes a space station. Here we learn about a conspiracy on the moon where the Monolith has been uncovered. Man touches the Monolith with their GLOVED hand and somehow evolves yet again which is presented in the next sequence by a computer called HAL with Artificial Intelligence (A.I.). A group men of all but two who are in hibernation then travel with HAL to the planet Jupiter on a ""mission"". There they discover the Monolith again. HAL goes crazy and tries to kill everybody. This is to show that HAL is evolving. The final scene is a confrontation where man touches the monolith with his MIND.2001 was made in 1968 before man had even touched on outer space and just shows how much vision Kubrick and Clarke had. The special effects still stand the cut today. It is all visually stunning and every cinematic process has been treated with absolute perfection. The final scene is a trip designed specifically for the acid movement of the 60s. Hippies reportedly launched themselves at the giant canvas screens and danced around before it.This is one of all time classic science fiction films and a great piece of daring metaphysical thought. It encapsulates everything that art and cinema stands for and also helped promote science and the theory of evolution to a deeply religious and changing world.The importance and impact of motion picture films is all right here in this stunning widescreen DVD presentation. It is an absolute must for any collection."	5.0	The Audacity is Transcended by the Technique	2004-01-10	10	7	3

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	ACGNP00TEIEV3	Pat Dewees	This was an awesome movie achievement when it came out in 1968.  And it still has timeless originality.  It is the kind of movie that stays with you.I have never seen '2001' on the big screen, only on a TV screen.  But when people first saw it in theaters, they undoubtedly got a better impression of the mood that the movie tries to convey.  Seeing it on a big screen surrounded them more thoroughly with a realistic depiction of space that is different from traditional sci-fi movies.  The lighting is harsh and the there is no sound in the airlock until one of the doors is open.  This all creates a cold, empty, lonely atmosphere.One has to appreciate the quality of the special effects given the time at which the movie was made.  Computer generated effects certainly were not available.  No wonder it took several years to make this movie.I didn't understand the first part of the movie until I watched a few times.  It has to be watched carefully.  Four million years ago, our ape ancestors see a smooth rectangular object called a monolith.  It plays a role in our evolution from apes to intelligent humans.  One of the apes is seen using a tool, a bone, to smash other bones.  The ape throws the bone up in the air in excitement.  Then, in the longest flash forward in movie history, the bone turns into a far more sophisticated tool, a spaceship.In 2001, there is a discovery that the government does not think people would be handle knowing and must be kept secret.  Astronauts fly to the moon to investigate a monolith, just like the ones the apes saw, that was found buried in the moon but has now been dug around.  Eighteen months later, a mission to Jupiter is undertaken with a crew of five.  The mission is because of a radio signal sent from the lunar monolith to Jupiter.  But this is so top-secret that it is not even known by the crew until late in the mission.There are problems with HAL 9000, the on-board computer that serves as the ship's and the mission's nerve center. Isaac Asimov's Laws of Robotics call for robots to protect themselves but not if it conflicts with the Robotic Law against hurting or killing a human, but this apparently does not apply to HAL.  After noticing two astronauts discussing HAL's disconnnection, self-preservation kicks in as the highest priority for HAL.'2001' is not for everyone.  Some will find it too slow moving, while other will insist on seeing and understanding everything the first time.  The ending is notoriously cryptic. To this day, Arthur C. Clarke refuses to explain it.  Maybe he intends for everyone to have their own interpretation of it.  My own interpretation, really a big guess, is that he is home.  He has come to his final resting place.  Not because he is dead.  He lives a full lifetime after arriving.  The bedroom comforts represent peace of mind.  Perhaps Clarke is suggesting that for some people, space exploration is not about satisfying curiosity but also about confronting our fears and our deepest questions about who we are and why we are here.	5.0	The most magnificent film of its time	2004-09-05	6	4	2

Most of the movie there is no dialouge. Just classical music and space ships. this gets boring. hell the first 15 minutes all we see are a bunch of apes running around. i turned this movie off half way through. i could not bear it. some good visuals but overall i just cant deal w/ the fact that there is little dialouge and we just have to watch things float through space. you may say i am not educated but whatever, this movie is boring. only people who saw it in 67 will think it was cool because at the time it was. now its just stupid. Just like &quot;psycho&quot; is no longer scary because now there is stuff 10 times as scary. this movie does not stand the test of time. I love Kubrick though.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3UA40JOD3BE1M	"Paul Fogarty ""Hopeless film addict!"""	"I actually hesitated about writing this review of one of my favorite films, after all, what could I write that has not already been said before? There are about 600 reviews of the film already on this site, and a sizable publishing industry has grown up around it over the years, critiquing, praising, lambasting, explaining, deconstructing, dissembling, and even spoofing. A quick search on Google - ""2001: a space odyssey"" - brings back over 700,000 results... surely there's nothing more to say? Oh well, I guess I'll just make a few observations and leave it up to you to decide if you want to go along for the ride.This film has always engendered extreme responses, but reading the Amazon reviews is instructive. Those who love it give a multitude of reasons, its startling, groundbreaking technical virtuosity, its scope of ideas, portraying Man's evolution from prehistoric Hominid to a being of pure thought or energy, the metaphysics, the unconventional narrative; some compare watching the film to an almost Messianic experience! Those who hate the film invariably trash it as boring and confusing; they don't get it, they want to be ""entertained.""Well, the film IS entertaining, just not in a Star Wars/RoboCop/Star Trek/Alien(s) kind of way... all of which I love I hasten to add! For instance, I would prefer to rip out my own fingernails with a pair of rusty pliers than sit through an opera or ballet performance, but I would never deny the skill and commitment it takes to be a 1st class performer in either discipline... it's just that I don't ""get it"" as an art form.""2001"" is a monumental cinematic achievement, it's safe to say there's never been a film like, and we'll never see it's like again! There are scenes of stunning technical artistry; the jump cut from a bone thrown into the air by one of the Hominids - the first tool/weapon - to orbiting nuclear weapons platform - the ultimate weapon. The docking of the space plane and the orbiting space station, the flight and landing of the Aries lunar transport at the Clavius base, including the stewardess' head-over-heals maneuver! The scenes at the TMA crater on the Moon; remember we hadn't yet landed on the Moon when this was filmed! ""2001"" presents the most realistic depiction of space travel ever created for the big screen; in space, not only can no one hear you scream, but spaceships don't go ""Whoooosh!"" There's Frank Pool's ""jogging"" scene, and Dave Bowman's entrance to the Discovery crew deck, a physical effect - no CGI - that looks impossible, like an Escher drawing come to life. The ""Star Gate"" sequence, the ""Ultimate Trip,"" as the critics christened it, ""Beyond the Infinite,"" and the final, beautiful, stunningly enigmatic image of the ""Star Child.""But IMHO, the most magnificent creation from Kubrick and Clarke is the ""HAL 9000"" computer that actually runs the Discovery. HAL is the most perfect Artificial Intelligence ever created by man, softly spoken, and quietly proud of his record of infallibility; ""...No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information. We are all, by any practical definition of the words, foolproof and incapable of error.""HAL is brought to life, not only by his dialogue, but also by the extraordinary characterization and vocal performance of Douglas Rain. Who could forget his pleading with Bowman as his higher brain functions are shut down, ""Dave... my mind is going... I can feel it... I can feel it,"" and his question to Dr Chandra as he contemplates his own destruction in ""2010;"" ""Will I dream?"" Poor HAL; forced to lie, driven insane, then lobotomized by his one remaining crewmate... is it any wonder that he is the most sympathetic character in ""2001?!"" HAL is the perfect minimalist deity in the AI universe; no garish flashing lights despoil him, no clunking, shuffling, man-in-a-suit ruins the illusion, HAL is pure intellect, viewing the world through gently glowing, all-seeing, lip-reading, wide-angle lenses. If we are to ultimately become slaves to the machine, HAL gets my vote!!!It's a common misconception that the film was based on Arthur C Clarke's novel; a Clarke short story, ""The Sentinel,"" was the jumping off point for the author and Kubrick, who both simultaneously wrote the screenplay and novel together. In fact, Kubrick ensured that the film was released BEFORE the book was published, he didn't want the audience to have all the answers! With ""2001"" he was exploring the ultimate questions of where we come from, and where we might be going, he wanted to ask questions of, and even to confound, the audience, and once said that if you came away from the film with more questions in your head than answers, then he had succeeded! But for anyone who is thinking of watching, I would definitely recommend reading the novel first, it provides a wealth of background information, as well as being structured in a much more traditional narrative format... it compliments the film perfectly, and will definitely help you to appreciate and understand it.Finally, I would like to do something I rarely do, and that is say a few words about the actual DVD production itself... it sucks! To say I was disappointed with this WB issue, ASIN: B00005ASUM, would be a major understatement; from the nasty, flimsy cardboard snap case, to the no frills disc, to the, at times, dreadful transfer - massive amounts of grain, and image quantization - this is an insult to an extraordinary cinematic achievement! If there's any film out there that demands a re-mastered, 2 disc's stuffed-to-the-gills-with-extras ""Criterion"" edition... THIS is it!!! (Criterion, PLEASE take note!)Personally, I can't recommend this film highly enough... but please be warned, you MAY be left scratching your head and wondering just what, exactly, it is you've seen!"	5.0	Beyond the Infinite...	2004-03-03	9	6	3

Did you think it was?The monoliths, the apes, the lack of emotion among the characters, the Discovery's voyage, the re-appearance of the monolith, and the brilliant ending (which is in fact emotional?

That's the point.It is like trying to explain the color blue to one who has always been blind. You can't just say, ""It's blue, so there.""The meaning to this movie is not so cut-and-dry as to be explained in two sentences (if it were, what would be the point in watching an entire work devoted to it?)This all requires thought. The answer is not given to you. If the movie is confusing, it is because it is given to us as a riddle (and a very useful one).

I watched it on my 42"" Toshiba 1080p HDTV and I noticed details I'd never noticed before:  a white fleck of lint on William Sylvester's tweed (?) suit at the space station briefing; in the shot of Sylvester walking down the white corridor with the red chairs, I had never noticed that behind the woman in the Hilton booth, there's ANOTHER woman further back in ANOTHER booth.  Or that the space station is not just run by Hilton, but that it's Hilton Space Station 5.  Or that the little red circles surrounding the door with the explosive bolts are tiny versions of the red Do Not Enter street signs in the U.S. (minus the words ""Do Not Enter"" of course).  Or that after Dave re-enters the Discovery through the emergency airlock and makes his way toward HAL's ""brain,"" he is wearing a GREEN helmet with his ORANGE spacesuit.  I know ""2001"" fanatics probably know most of this stuff already, and that if I go back and watch my standard-def DVD, I'll see that all this stuff was there all along -- the point is, I never NOTICED any of these details until watching this Blu-Ray disc.

In fact, dialogue in this movie is almost non-existent. There are long periods containing only music, or the breathing of astronauts in spacesuits, or sometimes no sound at all. The widescreen compositions are surprisingly detailed and dramatic. As a result, many people who have seen 2001 only on television don't think much of it. That's because its impact can only be appreciated on a theater screen where, paradoxically, the movie's periods of utter silence can be overwhelming. Despite all the improvements in special effects over the years, this remains the only movie that really does seem to take place in outer space, and space seems like a terribly cold, lonely, alien place. Much has been made about the end sequence, in which the last surviving astronaut of a deep-space mission is taken on a journey by unknown hands across undetermined distances to an unidentifiable destination. It is perhaps the one part of the movie that shows its age - that and the hairstyles of the women - but it is a minor complaint.

I was expecting a booklet, but I suppose all the extras are designed to answer our questions.  My biggest complaint is the lack of attention given to the soundtrack.  Out of all the documentary discussions, there is only a scant amount of reference to the importance of the music in this film.  Why wasn't a section devoted to this in the 'extras' featurettes?  It amazes me how little consideration is put into the gestalt that the music contributes to the film.  Gary Lockwood talks briefly about the original Alex North soundtrack, commissioned by and rejected by Kubrick, but cannot recall North's name.  In all the talk about Kubrick's genius with film, why do they not acknowledge just how creative he was in selecting the particular musical pieces which so solidly cohere our viewing experience?  Why not mention the uniqueness in placing music from Johann Strauss and Gyorgy Ligeti in the same film?  The soundtrack album introduced alot of people to the enjoyment of traditional classical music, as well as the 20th century experimental music, thus enhancing people's music appreciation.	5.0	requiem for music	2007-11-01	2	2	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2K3UTNW0783U6	Phillip Kay	2001 is an influential special effects film whose vision and underlying theme is underplayed to the point of obscurity.There are four sections: a depiction of the (uneventful) life of early man; an (uneventful) trip to the moon; a trip to Jupiter during which the spaceship computer tries to kill the astronauts; a final transformation and rebirth in space.Obviously plot structure does not hold the film together. But neither does thematic unity. The black boxes that pop up may stimulate great leaps forward of man's intelligence, or they may themselves be the source of that progress. The emotional responses of man are shown to be swamped by his place in his technological universe (early man and HAL are the only feeling creatures shown), which may be the source of his progress or decline (Kubrick offers no personal point of view). Are we celebrating technology (as Kubrick celebrated special effects in making the film) or the potentiality of mankind? Behind the obscurity and the dazzle of special effects can be discerned very little, a bathos. Nobody ever thinks about 2001. Except about the black boxes. What have they to do with tools, space flights to Jupiter or fetuses?The film for me contains six quite beautiful scenes: the opening credits; the famous jump cut; two shots of the astronauts battling HAL; the final ageing sequence; and the embryo in space. If only they had been pulled together in some meaningful way.Finally, the film ushers in the age of Hollywood special effects and the decline of the dramatic film.	3.0	The Power of Suggestion	2005-10-15	8	2	6

May want to re-title the film (2001 has a very different meaning in the post 9-11 age), as our unfortunate abandonment of deep space exploration has set us behind many years from where we once thought human's could be by now. Don't go into this film with the idea that it is just another sci-fi tale -- You need to bring something to the table with this motion picture. Do a little research and you will see how far Stanley Kubrick went into trying to get accuracy into the details of space travel. A good starting point for the budding young scientist. No, not a perfect film (as if there is such a thing), and not right for every occasion (and a bit dated in some of its ideas as to the origin of humans as well as the future of our species). Finally, if you never have the opportunity to see this film projected on a big screen, then the only other way to see it is in High-definition on the biggest screen you can find.	5.0	Excellent transfer, important film, mind expanding	2007-12-13	3	1	2

It was to be directed by Stanley Kubrick, the same man who had directed ""Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb"", a groundbreaking comedy of the same period as the fair. Aside from ""2001"", the only other work I had seen of Kubrick's was ""Spartacus"", so I had no real pre-conceived notions as to what to expect from Kubrick.And then I saw ""2001""....MAN, what a movie!! The general aesthetics, music, cinematography, casting, attention to detail and realism were without parallel up to this point in my moviegoing experience, and just the music ALONE would have been enough to hold my attention! ""2001"" immediately became one of the few movies up to that point that I saw, voluntarily, more than once. The concepts Arthur C. Clarke, the author of the short story ""2001"" was based on and the book that sprang from it, and Kubrick tried to get across in the movie don't quite become totally clear until you read the book, but the imagery in the film goes a long way toward reaching into your subconscious and relaying the message on a subliminal level anyway, helping you to better realize the concepts when they're made clear by the book. To this day, this incredible movie has no visual or conceptual equal in the world of film.

Many of you that have seen the film will agree with me, and many of you will not...Guess what? I thought it was very boring. Some examples, the 3 minutes of darkness at the beginning of the film before the ape scene was unnecessary I thought and also the 2 minute or so darkness after the ""Intermission"". Others included the multi-color lights as Dave travels through the Infinite - way too long and boring. Of course, that's Mr. Kubrick's artistic expression; I'm just giving you my opinion of it.....Some people always read too much into things. For example, there are people that look at abstract art and see the world, whereas I see just blobs of paint. The same goes for films. Does that make me wrong or stupid? I don't think so... I dare say that I'm quite intelligent and have a great attention span, but I still found 2001 very boring...Other notes on the DVD: Many times the sound effects is so loud, that you have to turn it down (the breathing in the space suit, the sounds of the ship, etc. - which are all necessary by the way). The problem this creates is that the dialog is then barely audible. I had to adjust the volume several times throughout the film and I never had to do that with other DVD's.My recommendation: If you've NEVER seen the film, do yourself a favor. Go rent it first at Blockbuster's. If you decide that you like it..., by all means, buy the DVD.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1RY3SERM5447N	pither	My comments only concern the DVD versus Blu-ray issue.I have an older version of the DVD (Stanley Kubrick Collection, white box) and the Blu-ray version. My experience has been that DVDs mastered in high definition look identical to the Blu-ray version (either on a Blu-Ray player or an upconvert DVD player). In this case, the Blu-ray version is MUCH better.  The differece is much like the samples used in stores to show the difference betwee regular and high definition--you know, grainy on one side sharp on the other.Although my DVD version is widescreen, it is old enough that my TV thinks the width is full screen.  With the 2.2:1 aspect ratio, this makes it look like a postage stamp in the middle of the screen.  Even worse, the transer is very poor.  A good comparison is with the sunrise scene at the start of the movie.  On the DVD, the colors run together and the clouds are indiscinct, even at the small size.  On the Blu-ray version, which fills the screen, the colors are fantastic and the detail in the clouds is great.That would be enough to recommend the Blu-ray version, but it also has several special features, including a commentary track, a documentary, four featurettes, artwork, photo gallery, and an audio interview with Kubrick.  The only extra on the DVD version is an interview with Arthur C. Clarke.In this case, the Blu-ray is definitely worth it, even if you already have the DVD version.	5.0	Blu-ray much better than DVD version	2008-02-25	8	7	1

Those who give this film low marks are sad creatures indeed and should be regarded as so.  To give such a classic low ratings is a cry for help and to be &quot;different&quot; for the sake of being, well, different.  Forget about free speech and all that jazz.  For chrissakes, even if you HATE the film as much as these peole say they do, then for the love of god show the decency afforded of such a film to at least give it more than one star!  What's the point people?  Is our generation THAT wasted on crap films like &quot;the medallion&quot; or the countless remakes and CGI infested films that plague our google-plexes?  This generation is wasted. Period.  To all the little creeps that take so much glee in giving this film a low rating:  I feel so sorry for you.  To not like this film is to NOT like movies at ALL.  Everything has a beginning.  In my opinion, the sci-fi genre began with 2001.  The movie is like a poem devoid of obvious meanings.  Practically all film-makers worth their salt call upon the works of kubrick as an inspiration in their works.  So, if you have not seen this movie, then rent it.  It may lull you at first.  But when you consider that it was made over a span of FOUR years and finally released in 1968 then you can finally appreciate the film from a technical standpoint.  No CGI at all.  Heck, even the readouts on the ships were done by painstaking animation and cut and paste methods.  Judge this film by at LEAST those merits.  Like I said before, hate the film for whatever reason you like.  But see the film as a triumph in movie magic.  Watch it and be dazzled by the ambiguous storyline and wonderous end sequence.  Trust me, as soon as the movie is over you'll find yourself BACK on the internet, digging for clues and opinions only to find that it's up to YOU to come to your own conclusions.  And that, my friends, is the whole meaning of this film.  It's a music video for your senses.  Enjoy.  You'll watch it again and again ....and again.  Don't say I did'nt warn you.  And if you need anymore coaxing, just remember what John Lennon of the beatles said himself when asked about 2001: A Space Odyssey: &quot;2001?

So I won't waste my time and yours by reviewing the movie itself, but will focus on the blu-ray itself. For my money, it's the best sci-fi movie ever made, and I'll leave it at that.Simply put, the picture quality here is stunning. I have never seen a 40-year-old movie look so good, and I'll be surprised if I ever do again. The enormous landscapes during the Dawn of Man segment look like something out ofPlanet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray]. The blinking lights and signs on the Discovery are so clear you'll swear you're looking at them directly, not on a screen (and certainly not on 40-year-old film stock!). In case it isn't already clear, I was completely blown away by how good this movie looks.Now, the movie is enough to sell this disc by itself, but it's also pretty loaded with special features. I haven't made it through them all yet, but they seem to be comprised of equal parts quality information and 2001/Kubrick worship (not that it isn't deserved...). I'm glad to know how they did some of the special effects, but who cares if Spielberg and George Lucas say that Kubrick was a genius?For under $20, this is one of the best blu-ray deals out there, and is simply a no-brainer.	5.0	Eye-popping transfer of 2001...	2008-06-09	4	3	1

Colors are clear and the image is sharp, without any evidence of too much digital tinkering.  The sound is also excellent.I watched the entire film from start to finish and the vastly improved picture and sound quality made the entire experience much more meaningful and enjoyable.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey is a visual marvel and a director's dream.  Mr. Kubrick reduces the role of the actor in film as only about one quarter of the film has spoken parts (and a good part of the dialogue is from an inanimate object, the HAL 9000 computer) and relies on the unspoken visual to relate the story.  The story is starts at the dawn of man on Earth which are represented by apes.  They form a tribe and eventually learn the art of killing, we are then transported into outer space on space ship carrying a Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) to the moon on a top secret mission to find out about some disturbances amongst a space crew working up there.  We are then taken to the space ship Discovery which is on a mission to Jupiter with two astronauts, Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), and the HAL computer as well as three cryogenically frozen doctors who will be awaken upon their arrival at Jupiter.  We are never really told what the mission is all about, but along the way, HAL malfunctions and tries to take over the ship.  He kills the three doctors by cutting off their life support and then catapults Frank into space.  Dave rescues Frank by taking a small craft out to him and catching him in its claws.  He must let Frank go to his death though as HAL refuses to let Dave back into the ship.  Dave eventually dismantles HAL and then is transported on a mind-expanded journey that is a visually kinetic splash of lights, colors and sounds.  Throughout the film, the one connecting element is a strange large black monolith that appears at the end of each of the three sequences and is never really explained.  One is left to guess its meaning.  Is it God? Is it some other metaphysical force?  Mr. Kubrick never divulged the meaning of it, so one is left to wonder.  2001: A Space Odyssey is a weird film to say the least.  It can be very boring and tedious in places, but it is an absolutely beautiful film to watch and the effects are still first rate.  With the new home theater systems and wide screen TV's available today, you can recreate the scope and vision of Mr. Kubrick more effectively than on a small screen where much of the film is lost.	3.0	Odd Indeed	2003-01-29	16	6	10

This film explores - in poetic, awe-inspiring, achingly beautiful, visual detail - man's transition to the next level of physical, mental, and spiritual attainment.  What, then, is HAL?  HAL is a symbol of the outer limit - and limitations - of the material and of technology.  The soulless HAL would not, could not, allow anything - or anyone - to interfere with his programmed mission.  What is the monolith?  It is a facilitator, a catalyst, a door.  An opening of the mind and senses to an expanded reality - released from material limits and from time itself.

I was disappointed to say the least. But may be I found it a flop because I saw the movie today (13th Sept 2003). If I had seen the movie in 1968 I think I would've called it awesome just for the visuals, the lack of dialogue and poor ending will still have been disappointing. Hal, the human thinking computer was wasted, the black stone was not resolved, as was not the fate of david the sole surviour. If like me you want to see this movie some 35 years later, prepare to be disappointed, and I would like to advise you: if you like visuals and you have not seen The Lord of the Rings or the Matrix don't waste your time with this well out of date rubbish!	1.0	How can this be a classic sci-fi or is it just me?	2003-09-12	57	10	47

It can be used to judge all other transfers.The movie's aspect ratio has been corrected from previous editions to 2:20:1 (it was 2:35:1 before). There is no grain or evidence of DNR or border enhancement. The picture is so flawless that you actually can see the unevenness of the screen used for front projection in the Dawn of Man sequence. The colors are flawless with no bleeds for reds or yellows. This is nice when HAL is dismantled and then you get to the acid sequence. The blacks are inky. And the picture is just perfect.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2J6B4R09KLM1N	Postman	"I had remembered this film from the past with fondness, but I was unsure how it would play 20 years on since the last time I saw it.  I admit to being a ""techie"" and have always been fond of sci-fi flicks, but I remembered subtle touches that set ""2001.."" apart.  For instance Kubrick had set all the scenes in the near vacuum of space silent, just as they are.  Also, the meticulous detail used in the weightless scenes wears well over time (the sound of the astronauts breathing in their helmets was cool, though a bit creepy).  Even the 60's fashion, set as post 2000 fashion (with its slight campiness) still looks futuristic and makes this viewer think what ""might have been"".  Certainly, the time period sets and costumes fare better than ""2010.."", the sequel to this film.  All in all, I would say that this film has indeed stood the test of time well.  I still don't quite get the ending, but then again I suppose Clarke and Kubrick wanted it that way... I recommend this film, especially to sci-fi devotees.  As far as the quality of the digital format, it was top notch as well.  Highly recommended."	5.0	A great odyssey that wears the test of time	2012-06-22	1	1	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1FLFRBQD5UUJL	Prentice St. Clair	If you enjoy the Sci-Fi genre and/or classic cinema, then this is a must-see.  The special effects STILL hold up extremely well (with no freaking CG).  And the realism in the depiction of space is refreshing.  (no, you CANNOT hear the ship engines roar to life when you're outside the ship).  Also, it is interesting to watch the 1960s predictions of what it would be like in 2001.  My teenage daughter got a chuckle from the ridiculously huge video-phone.  I got a chuckle from the space &#34;airlines&#34; with only one person in the cabin and dozens of empty seats!  The movie is slow, which seems to be the norm back in the late 60s and early 70s, but if you enjoyed movies like The Conversation, The Godfather, Dog Day Afternoon, Taking of Pelham 1-2-3, then 2001 will not be a problem, especially if you embrace the slowness of these movies because it gives the viewer time to enjoy the scenery, character development, and build-up of tension.  Sometimes it is difficult for the first-time user to understand what's going on, but worth the wait until the end--and it's fun to speculate about the point of the story.  Definitely follow 2001 up with 2010:  The Year We Make Contact, which answers most of the questions posed by 2001, plus it's a good movie.	4.0	A Must-see (with patience!) Classic	2014-03-25	0	0	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ	Private Quentin Tarantino Fan	As far as Science Fiction goes, 2001: A Space Odyssey truly is a marvel in the genre.  While, in this age which has proven some of the theories of this movie wrong, it's still chilling in some of it's (HAL, while we do not have a robot like this, is still one of the coolest sci-fi villians ever).  It's not just a great look at evolution and other realistic topics, it's also a dazzling, visual toure de force, too.  Oh sure, it's definitely not perfect, but 2001: A Space Odyssey rules beyond the clouds (HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!) at it's best moments.Is 2001 flawless?  Hardly.  The movies does move at a slow pace, but that's not necessarily a bad thing all the way.  The first chapter, which features nothing but a blank screen and classical music playing over it, is absolutely annoying and does not do anything for the movie.  Other than that, there is no one particular scene, but some scenes are not as strong as others.  For example, the totally awesome scene where the astronaut goes into the....erm, lights and other _____ is a lot more exciting than the board meeting will ever be (hey, just like real life!).  But that's the only real problem with this movie.  The slow pace only makes the movie move in a better pace and does a great job of adding some tension (especially when fixing the spaceship, it gives a sense of eagerness and drive to fix something and feel the rewards).People who hate this for no action are idiots.  Lack of action?  Who Gives a ____?!  This movies' thrill and entertainment can really be retained by both message and visuals.  But mostly visuals.  I've heard such retarded claims such as the special effects being dated, heh, the ships move fine to me, clowns.  Besides, I like the way the ships and the other vehicles in space move elegatanly.  This is a fantastic piece of film-making.  The use of classical music only enchances it more, as watching the dramatic use of classical music while the monkey finds the use of a bone gives the relevancae and only shows the importance of this invention.Alright, I can understand why somewhat would not like this.  But 2001: A Space Odyssey is a gorgeous trip through the wonders of space, but without the boring documentary feel.  ANd it certainly doesn't have any pesky Jedi's, aliens, Chewbacka's, and Terminator's (please note I respect and can enjoy Stars Wars and the Alien movies, and Arnold).  I still don't think there's nothing quite like the movie.

The Dawn of Man involves the discovery of tools that in the later stage he no longer needs-precipitated by a defining power struggle with his most sophisticated machine of all.Those who complain about the sparse dialogue should be aware of the nature of film as it differs from that of the literary arts. Chaplin knew that saying nothing when an artist can show what he wants to convey by action, expression and camera/editing is the highest level of cinematic art, and 2001 is an art film.2001 is an exquisite work on many levels. The dry, often ""black, humor"" is Kubrick's trademark. The scenes of conflictive interaction between Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Hal the computer are priceless and darkly hilarious-definitely no slapstick here, only a highly intelligent wit that provokes more questions than solutions to man's dilemmas as he moves through the stages of evolution as spectacularly set up by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, whose book was based on his and Kubrick's own screenplay. 2001 is a major cinematic work and one that will endure into posterity, provoking and delighting film audiences for generations to come."	5.0	a True Evolution of the art of Cinema	2005-07-17	0	0	0

It is a little slow though but that's how the movie just is. It's definitely worth watching as it provided the basis for so many other movies and is a great reference point for talking about the sci fi genre. I pretty much enjoyed everything about the movie aside from the sounds and sound track are repetitive and many of the sound effects are extremely grating although I believe this is intentional as I suppose it heightens the uncomfortableness of those moments.

Years later, 2001 still looks brand new, and thanks to the blu-ray upgrade it looks as if it was made yesterday.

Even today, now after watching it I can't remember how many times and that I have the limited DVD edition I still sit in awe of it's magnificence.  Kubrick was a genius, make no mistake about it.

""Lost In Translation"" and ""Blade Runner"" (any version) come to mind, but ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is right at the top of the list.How can I fairly promise you that a sparse movie with very little dialogue and even less of a plot will be a grand old time with your TV?  How in the world can I promise you won't get restless during the opening scenes where apes slowly evolve into dangerous animals?  Or those long sequences where spacecrafts move incredibly slow on their travels?  How about the befuddling ending - how can I promise you that it will be worth the trouble?The only guarantee I can make with ""2001: A Space Odyseey"" is that whether you like it or not, you will never forget it, and there will never be another movie like it.  For those reasons alone, it deserves a peek.""2001"" is an experience - a musical, artistic experience where we watch man and technology interact.  Watching this movie is like looking at an interpretive dance number or browsing an art gallery: If you don't care for it, was it because the music?  The design?  The artist?  To be sure, Stanley Kubrick was hardly a commerical filmmaker, especially in his latest work with Warner Bros. from the early 60s to his death in 1999.  This film might be his most uncommercial.I'm not typing this review to tell you whether the critical community and hardcore movie buffs are right, or whether the casual moviegoer is wrong (not that lovers and haters all belong to either side, mind you).  After all, reviews are just a person's two cents.  Well, here are mine:""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is an impressive technical acheivement even in today's climate of computer graphics.  Had it not been for the wonderful classical music, I probably would've become angry at the film's deliberately slow pace.  The reason I forgive the occasional gratuitous moments is because once I saw this as an opportunity to just reflect on mankind, space, and the future... I was hooked.  Watching ""2001"" is like putting on a classical record, taking a seat, and relaxing your senses.  If you're getting into the story and marvelling at the long sequences, then I am very happy for you.  If experiencing ""2001"" ends up numbing your senses and makes you wish you were doing something else, I don't blame you.  Believe me, I don't blame a single person who dislikes this movie.  But if so many of us love it, would you consider a second chance to pick a comfy chair and try again?

The sheer beauty and majesty  that takes your breath away through the visually dynamic composition  Kubrick displays; with his keen eye for design, shape, color, movement and  sound, all working together as a whole. The story is quite abstract and  esoteric in many ways, but one is forgiving and understanding when they  &quot;feel&quot; this film through sound and motion. The story may be  interpreted in many ways, and has been done so offers symbolic  spirituality, the dual between man and manchine, the origins of man and  where he is going through space and time. Definately Kubrick's masterpiece  as well as groundbreaking in Hollywood cinema. The DVD version is  incredible with the sound. The extras are ok. A trailer, and a 9-minute  lecture by A.C. Clark.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1P49YMRCG63GZ	Rasih Bensan	"The movie 2001 a Space Odyssey which came out in 1968 by Stanley Kubrick based on the novel by  the same name by Arthur C. Clarke is in my opinion still the best science fiction movie ever made even today in 2008 after 40 years of its production. Because  unlike many other science fiction movies it is realistic; it does not make  the scientific mistakes made by many  other science fictions such as sound of explosions being heard in space. Obviously sound needs a medium to travel so in space explosions can not generate sound. This movie has taken this scientific fact into account.The story stretches human imagination and  begins from the dawn of  humans on Earth  in the African Savanna 4 million years ago and jumps to the year 1999 and continues to 2001.It raises many philosophical questions about human life's meaning in the universe, the dawn of humans, artificial intelligence, human vs. artificial intelligence, extraterrestrial intelligence, zero gravity, time, space, acceleration, dimensions etc. In fact, the viewer who is familiar with theories of physics such as Newtonian physics, Einstein's theory of General Relativity, Quantum Physics, String Theory etc. gets into even deeper thinking and pleasure while viewing the entrance into and journey in the monolith orbiting  Io ( which is a satellite of Jupiter ) of the astronaut David Bowman  who said with awe : "" My god, it's full of stars ! "" and was transported to some other strange world where the physics laws as we know them did not apply. If you read "" The Fabric of the Cosmos "" by the physicist Brian Green and "" A Brief History of Time "" by the famous contemporary physicist Stephen Hawking you will see them mention that there is no discovery in physics so far that necessitates the flow of time in only one direction i.e. from the present towards the future as we take for granted.There is nothing in the laws of physics discovered so far to prove that time can not also flow backwards i.e.from the future towards the past. We can see this reversal in the direction of flow of time back and forth being demonstrated in the last scenes of the movie 2001 A Space Odyssey; in a strange room in a mysterious world that he has been transported to when he entered  with his space pod the monolith orbiting Io, David Bowman jumped from being a young man to become an older man then an older man still. He briefly existed simultaneously at both ages and saw the older David Bowman. At the very end he went back to being a baby inside a womb. These are examples of the break in the direction of flow of time towards the future. This alternation in the direction of the flow of time is not just science fiction. As I mentioned above its possibility of occuring is discussed in some books written by some physicists.  Unsophisticated viewers with little or no knowledge of physics and astronomy will also enjoy the movie provided that they are interested in space and / or the meaning of existence of humankind.Although today in 2008 we have already passed the year 2001 i.e. the year when the story of the movie is occurring, the issues put forward in the movie are still very relevant. Obviously, humankind has not yet reached the level of space technology predicted for the year 2001 in the novel and in the movie. But unless humankind is terminated in the near future by a nuclear  war, severe climate changes due to global warming and pollution, impact to Earth by an asteroid or a comet, polar shift in the Earth's magnetic field, avian ( bird ) flu or another  lethal virus epidemic, the arrival to Earth of  the Anti Christ 666 or by some other natural disaster, humankind will eventually reach the level of technology shown in the movie, perhaps within the next 100 years.The computers and electronic gadgets, the visual and mobile phones, wireless internet  communication technology and other equipment that we see in the movie on board the space station orbiting Earth and aboard spaceship Discovery en route to Jupiter already exist in the real world today to the extent of technological level of development and sophistication seen in the movie except for HAL - 9000 computer which can think and experience emotions. But the movie demonstrates that things can go wrong with even the most advanced computers that are able to think, feel, talk to humans and understand  their speech, despite a past record of no errors: in spite of its technological sophistication level the HAL - 9000 computer malfunctioned  and killed several astronauts on board U.S.S. Discovery and was therefore disconnected by the surviving astronaut David Bowman.Human hybernation seen in the movie has not yet become a reality either but in general developments in electronics, computers and communication technology of today have been predicted with remarkable accuracy when the film came out 40 years ago in 1968. Of course we have not yet colonised the moon, and the real space stations orbiting Earth, and manned spacecraft  today are yet nowhere near as technologically developed and awesome as the ones seen in the movie, but I think it is only a matter of 50 to 100 more years before we get there.The sight and sound effects all throughout the movie are very good and enjoyable to watch. The end of the movie leaves a lot of room for the creative imagination of the viewing audience to interpret what is happening. The music including the valses by Johan Strauss is very appropriate for this kind of movie. This film not only entertains but leaves the  interested viewer thinking about the fundamental questions regarding mankind `s place and meaning in the universe. It is also a spectacular sound and light show. I think 2001 a Space Odyssey has become a classic science fiction movie which is very close to science fact, therefore for many more years it is unlikely to be surpassed in excellence by any other science fiction movie.I also recommend that the viewer watch the continuation of this Odyssey named : "" 2010 : The year we make contact "" also based on the novel by Atrhur C. Clarke by the same name and also a very good science fiction movie.  2010 continues the Odyssey where 2001 left off. In fact the two movies can be seen as a single movie if watched in the proper sequence i.e. watch 2001 first and then watch 2010 a few days later. 2010 came out about 15 years after the movie 2001 was made."	5.0	This is the best science fiction movie ever made, moreover it is close to science fact.	2008-10-17	6	5	1

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2VODABWSVHV8E	"Ray ""A Reader"""	"I wouldn't even begin to attempt to review 2001: A Space Odyssey. It's a complex, but undeniably riveting, tale, although there is a certain amount of disagreement as to the story's ultimate meaning. In some ways, the work defies review. The movie was one of a clutch that appeared in the late 1960's that somehow broke through existing ceilings of production to become critically acclaimed and, apparently, were rarely met or surpassed by subsequent films within their respective genres.What I can say is that the release of this movie in the Blu-Ray high definition format makes viewing the movie the most powerful experience I've had since seeing the film in person when the work was first released. The transfer of the image to Blu-Ray has been carefully accomplished, with a level of clarity and resolution that is absolutely incredible. In fact, watching 2001 in this format (and when coupled with a high resolution, LED TV) is nearly as astounding as watching the movie for the first time some 40 years ago. Colors are rich and saturated, the wide screen aspect of the movie is preserved, and for the first time since its release, we are able to see the closest thing to the director's, and director of photography's, intent.2001 is a highly stylized, artistic film, with astounding sets and art design that still rivals nearly anything done today. The Blu-Ray format reveals some of the special effects as just that, but only rarely. The majority still look as good as most anything you'll see in today's CGI universe, and often times, surpasses them. But perhaps even more impressive is the sheer artistic style and gorgeousness of set after set. Its as if the film were sculpted as a series of art pieces, and in a real sense, that's exactly what it is.DVD was great when it was released, and DVD still serves a good purpose for many movies. But there seem to be some movies that were just ""waiting"" for Blu-Ray to be invented, and 2001: A Space Odyssey is almost certainly one of them. Blu-Ray came along around 2007 or so, missing the ""2001"" date, but it was worth the wait.Additional Note:THere are some great Bonus features on this disc, including period documentaries and marketing shows that accompanied the movie's development. But take the time to listen to the audio-only recording of Stanley Kubrik being interviewed for about two hours. It's not only informative and terribly interesting, but at times, absolutely hysterical. I was laughing so hard at points that I was crying. What a great counter-force to this serious, philosophical work."	5.0	A Brief Comment on the Blu-Ray Version of 2001	2012-01-07	11	11	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AOPQ0KA1B7BFD	Ray Gray	Blu-ray review only.  Enough has been said about the movie.When I upgraded my home theater to a big screen HDTV and Blu-ray player with DVD enhancing technology one of the first DVD's I popped in the player from my home library was 2001: A Space Odyssey. I literally could not watch the DVD.  The DVD transfer, acceptable on a big screen CRT TV, was just too poorly done to watch on the new HD system.When I saw the price of the blu-ray on Amazon I immediately upgraded and hoped for the best.  What a difference!  The images were sharp, the colors brilliant, and the sound filled the room.  Once again the experience of watching one of my absolute favorite movies was thoroughly enjoyable.  Yes, you'll notice the Blu-ray movie isn't quite as razor sharp as recently produced movies, but the Blu-ray treatment of a beloved sci-fi classic is well worth the upgrade if the DVD is sitting on your home library shelf.	5.0	Blu-ray: 5 Stars!!!!!	2011-02-23	4	4	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A29R3O02O0PON4	"Razr Maxx ""Metal Head"""	OK, I'd like to refute all the negative reviews of this film.  Alright first of all, yes its a slow film and quite weird at times, but this film is not about the cinematics, visuals, or even plot for that matter.  To enjoy this film, you must take it in context from when it was made.  2001: A Space Odyssey was released in 1968.  It was a time when space travel was in its infancy.  Hell, we hadn't even gone to the moon yet.  Also it was made in a fashion that used *real* space physics, as opposed to the cheesey sci-fi movies of the 50s and early 60s.Every space shot, whether it was in a spaceship or the space station exhibited the way things are (or actually will be when we actually achieve this level of technology, ie, we've passed 2001 and we're pretty far behind).  This movie was not made to tell an exemplarary story, but to show Arthur C. Clarke's vision of the future.  If you want to watch it for the story, watch its sequal 2010 first and then watch 2001 to fill in the back story.  This movie was made with loads of symbolism.  For example starting below...The monkey scene at the beginning was necessary to show the evolution of primitive man.  From extremely primitive to learning how to use tools (the bones) as weapons to kill animals for food and to fight off agressors.  The shot where the ape throws the bone into the air and it comes back down as a satelite shows that the time it took for man to advance that far has been a drop in the bucket in galactic time.As far as the monoliths, that's a bit of a puzzle, because even 2010 doesn't really answer where they have come from.  But nonetheless, they are there saying that there is a greater power out there than us humans.  For instance the monolith on the moon was buried, suggesting that it was put there a LONG time ago.As far as the whole HAL thing, that shows that computers have become so advanced that they are capable of killing humans (through conflicting orders from the Doctor as we later find out in 2010).  But this movie is the first to accurately portray the physics of space that there is no sound in space.  ie.  No air in space, no way for sound waves to travel.To fully enjoy this film you have to be somewhat scientifically minded.  And to realize that this was the first true sci-fi film that used true space physics.  I first saw this movie back in the late 80's and was mentored through it by my folks who had seen it back in '68 and therefore was given the symbolism directly firsthand.  So...in the meantime check out 2010 and then come back to this one.	4.0	OK, yes its slow, but wait just a minute.	2002-02-19	3	2	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3PPSVETY3F680	"RCD  Music and Movies ""We Own You"""	"Kubrick's visual image of the novel by Clarke is extraoridinary, and I recommend strongly that anyone planning to watch this movie to read the book first. Although a classic, the film is hard to follow if you have never read the novel.Kubrick's uniqueness is definitely shown in this film, much like ""The Shining,"" and the score as well as impressive designs are beautiful.The film does vary from the book, and it is understandable: The movie was released first. However, that does not excuse the film's sudden jump from the Jupiter Mission to Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite. Even after reading the book, the leap is random and confusing.The lack of dialogue in ""2001"" has been criticized, but it actually makes the movie better. This is not about what humans do, it is a vision of evolution and the evils of technology. Along with its unique ""vision"", the environment of Clavius as well as the ""Discovery"" are awesome, and the characters of HAL 9000 and Bowman are excellent.The theme, Strauss's ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" is heard three times throughout the film, and truly captures the feeling that Kubrick portrays.This film was twenty-first on AFI's ""100 Years, 100 Movies"", and also featured HAL 9000 at number thirteen for the villains of AFI's ""100 Years, 100 Heroes and Villains."""	5.0	Also Sprach Zarathustra (Thus Spake Zarathustra)	2005-09-12	3	2	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AMP6N2EKBS73R	RD White	If you want a movie with explosions and car chases or cute creatures this movie is not for you...if you do want to explore the deep mysterious of the universe and the place there of human beings as well as accurate depictions of spaceflight, at least in our time, you will be intrigued and enlightened. Director Stanley Kubrick leaves his mark of excellence on the subject, like he does with the majority of his films. The film will easily lead one into questions of religion and mankind's misinterpretation of nature from our perspective as &#34;fish at the bottom of an ocean of air&#34; to quote the late co-author Arthur C. Clarke. Although the technology did not arrive in the 33 years between the film's release and the title date, it is still a film of &#34;science-eventuality&#34; as Spielberg put it, unless our species self-destructs through war or environmental disaster. Other sci-fi films that will not insult your intelligence: 1997's &#34;Contact&#34; with Jodie Foster by Robert Zemeckis and The Andromeda Strain (1971) by Robert Wise...	5.0	Still the most mature and thought-provoking science-fiction film of all time...	2013-02-23	1	1	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AX5WSHD1U2ANF	"Reader B ""avid reader"""	As disclosure, I first saw this movie when it came out, in a theater with Cinerama.  It was awesome.Truly, this movie is the genesis for all that followed it.  Up to then, Sci-fi was mainly B-movies, with space monsters.  It showed how quality could be done, and set the bar for sci-fi movies to follow.  Some met it, some didn't.And thankfully, the extra material finally explains what the ending really means.  NOT!  You are meant to ponder the meaning, not being given it spoon fed.  This movie is meant to have the person think about it.What the movie is not:  it is not a 'bug' hunt.  It is not a shoot-em up.  It is not the Wild West in space.The movie may be considered slow paced by some, especially younger viewers.  And much of the music is from the classics, so it will endure forever.This movie was before computer graphics.  The special effects where either done through models, chemicals, or other tricks of the camera.The extras have interesting information.  For instance, the monitor screens were done by back projected 16 mm projectors.  The computer chess match has an 'error', which was deliberate.  Stanley Kubrick was a chess master, and put in the mistake to see of others would catch it.2001: A Space Odyssey is a film by a film master.  That won't appeal to everyone, which is a shame.	5.0	Sets the Standard	2010-12-04	2	2	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AT7CXVV43ZSRX	"Reading Fan ""Romans 8:1"""	A lot of people would say that this movie would not compare with the great digitally-enhanced movies of today, like Lord of the Rings, and King Kong.  They would say that the pace is too slow, that the movie is, believe it or not, small and claustaphobic, since so much of it takes place inside a space craft.Well, I can't tell someone what to like, but I can say that I still think it is a masterpiece.  If it were re-done today, and I hope that doesn't happen, special effects would dominate the movie, instead of the story itself.  The story definately takes center stage, and what a story it is.  I won't tell you the story (in case you haven't seen the movie), but it has to do with mankind's destiny in outer space.  A strange signal draws a space ship to the outer reaches of the solar sysem.  The message of the movie about our place in space is not one we would necessarily want to hear or agree with, but one that is as loud as its famous theme 'Thus Spake Zarathustra' by Richard Strauss.The story is a very strange one by Author C. Clarke, and it has a wallop of a surprise ending.  (Again, I won't tell you the story in case you haven't seen it.)  I liked the way the story developed step-by-step.  Director Stanley Kubrick was masterful in his broad, sure strokes (what some people would call slow pacing.) The special effects were convincing and pace-setting for 1968, but not what we would expect today.  There were only a few people in the movie, with one of the main characters being a talking computer that controlled the space craft. That said, I can't imagine new technology improving on the way the story culminates. It is still a classic.I think I liked the mood of the movie better than anything else about it. There was throughout the movie a strange feel of isolation and danger.  Keir Dullea was perfect as the key astronaut and seemed to have even less personality than HAL, the computer. Those two characters drove the movie.The soundtrack in my opinion was phenomenal.  It started with the Johann Strauss Blue Danube Walz to show the dancing of space vehicles, and it proceeded with a dissonant choral piece that indicated uncertainty and danger, and ended with a very strange, edgy orchestral piece that was perfect for representing the metaphysical aspect of the adventure. At times, the sound effect was that of quiet and sometimes only breathing, which emphasized the sense of isolation.  There is also a scarcity of dialoque, such that even the trailer has no dialogue.  (An interesting side note is that Alex North composed the original soundtrack for the movie, but did not know it would not be used until Kubrick released the movie with classical music instead.  His album for the unused soundtrack still  has a cult following.)In my opinion, if you want to see a great movie and story, this is still one to see.	5.0	Still a masterpiece	2006-01-31	4	4	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A26JNMW0P71BRE	Rebecca Parks	You don't need any other film after this one.The film, a 1968 futuristic look of the year 2001, is amazing. From the Evolution scenes to the Star Gate (and everything in between), you have no choice but to be confused.But confusion is a good thing while experiencing something such as this. '2001' is thought-provoking and makes you question every  bit. And that was the whole idea!I was two years old when I first saw the film, and again when I was seven. I never had a true appreciation and love until I was twelve. Most people would be hopelessly bored by the time the first line is said (about 25 minutes into the film), but I was entranced.Of course, I grew up with Science Fiction (Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick; and Star Trek, of course!), so unless you did as well, you might not feel the same way I do.But if you've only seen it once and thought it was too confusing to love, go ahead and watch it again.

I've read this is also due to the film being shot on 70mm. Everything is just super sharp and colors are correctly represented. What amazes me so much is the effect work was so well done that even though it was done in 1967-1968 everything still looks extremely realistic in HD, even the ape costumes. This movie is one that seems to be love it or hate it. I didn't like it when I first saw it many years ago when I was young. Since that time I had seen 2010 which I really liked a lot and when 2001 came out on HD I figured I'd watch it again to see if my opinion changed. Sure enough I now love the movie. Being they don't outright explain the full concept of the movie in dialog I think it may help some viewers to give 2010 a watch then see 2001 again.Anyhow, there are hundreds of reviews on the movie itself but I just wanted to review the HD DVD to say just how amazing the quality is.

It makes the cientific treatment of Arthur Clarke in the book looks so trivial. Don't get me wrong, I like the book either, but Kubrick was a visionary. This movie could never gain a better treatment, even if someone decided to remake it with modern technology, witch I personally believe that would ruin all the beauty of the movie.This is one of these movies in witch seeing is better than trying to explain to non viewers. For those interested in seeing this masterpiece or for those who already saw the movie, check out [...] to get some questions answered.This DVD have nothing special on the extras, just the trailer and some special information. I believe that this could have a better treatment, once we are talking about a Kubrick's classic masterpiece. Well, even without some extra material, this movie is still essential to those who can spend some time putting your brains in action. It have a very slow rhythm, it's not a movie to see action, to entertain with non-stop action pack and nonsense SFX, it's a movie to admire, to think, to reflect.

You can actually see the clear plastic disc it's stuck to - down to the wipe marks and prints!They could have done a better job cleaning it up though.

Easy to clean up, but they did not bother.SciFi fan, Kubrick fan, or just curious - get this movie. The cultural references to this movie can be found in so many other movies and TV shows it's nary impossible to list.  The Simpsons, Futurama, Monty Python, South Park, and Robots comes to mind.

That's right, Star Wars takes a back seat. If you have not seen this movie then you are missing something in your life. Stanley Kubrick really makes you think, I would highly recommend any of his films.  Anyway, this is not a typical movie. For the first 20 and last 20 minutes, there is NO dialouge. In a leap that spans millenia, Kubric jumps to the ""future,"" the year 2001 (The movie was made in 1968). The graphics and video quality are absolutely incredible, especially for a movie made so long ago. For those who don't appreciate the true quality of the movie, (it's a little slow at times for younger viewers) it still has an interesting and modern-day style Sci-Fi story. But the real pinnicle of this movie is the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but it really makes you think. I highly reccomend that you set aside 2 hours to watch this movie to truly enjoy it without distraction. In regards to the lack of special features, this movie speaks for itself. Kubrick wanted YOU to think, he didn't want to tell you what he thinks.  I would reccomend this movie to ANYONE."	5.0	Perfect Masterpiece	2006-01-28	3	3	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1XAU4UJX4OZBI	Richard L. Smith	I like most anything to do with space. When I first saw 2001, I was like many, in that I did not knowwhat some of it ' meant '. The beginning sequences of the rise of Man, were well crafted and themake up for the different humanoids, was raw and very life - like. The idea that there was some sortof ' object ' ( The Monolith ), imparting knowledge at specific times of ' heavenly bodies ' and their alignment,was very original; made me think about Stonehenge and how Man seems to want to place structures so hecan find answers to questions about the meaning of life. Yet the idea of a Monolith buried on the Moon,implied those of such great power, they could alter a planet's history. To me, the evolution of Man, isa given. This Space Odyssey does not provide clear answers. It asks the viewer to use their imaginationand come to their own conclusions.

Kubrick may or may not have been trying to be an interplanetary Fellini here, but the thing that took this flick over the top was always its technological plausibilty. Nobody cared in old-line  sci-fi whether or not the spaceships or ray guns made any sense--the  filmmaker or the viewer. That was even true with &quot;Star Trek&quot; and  still is (and I don't regard myself a traitor to my Trekkie identity  admitting that). But you look at &quot;2001&quot; hardware and can see  where it was just around the corner. A lot of that gear can be built today  by any one of half-a-dozen aerospace firms. Like those one-man pods  (&quot;open the pod bay doors, HAL&quot;). The only reason they're not  built by someone like General Dynamics today is that there's no mother ship  like &quot;Discovery&quot; to use them on. Or that video phone call Dr.  Floyd makes to his small daughter from the space station. There's software  and peripheral hardware with those capabilities available for the computer  you're reading this review through now. The way this store/ site keeps  adding &quot;departments&quot;, you'll be able to buy the stuff here. See  what can happen in a generation? That's why I say (read my  lips)--&quot;tech-ni-cal plaus-i-bil-i-ty&quot;.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A151SW6QL7P4DR	R McLeod	I've been told that this movie is best viewed if you've read the book (and although I'm an Arthur C. Clarke fan, I actually havent yet), so I'm probably at a disadvantage, but I didn't think a whole lot of this movie.Some scenes were unnecessarily drawn out. I suppose during these scenes I was supposed to be sitting there enjoying the soundtrack, but unfortunately that sort of classical music isn't really my cup of tea. I found myself wanting to fast forward at various points.I found a lot of the sound effects just annoying. Particularly, in some of the drawn out scenes, that I also suppose were drawn out for dramatic effect. They did have dramatic effect, but the high-pitched beeping sound when &quot;vitals critical&quot; was flashing on the screen was a little bit of an assault on my ear drums.I'd like to stop and say that I really enjoyed the part with HAL. HAL makes the whole movie worthwhile to watch at least once.However, the majority of this movie makes no sense to me. I had NO idea what was happening from the point HAL gets disconnected to the end. I'm sure it was all very interesting, and I think I could've figured out what was going on if I watched it a few more times and wracked my brains for a while, but I really shouldn't have to do that just to figure out what happened. I'll just read the book instead.Basically, I like the meat of this movie, but I dont like how it was presented. I'll still give it three stars for HAL though.	3.0	A little drawn out and confusing.	2005-08-06	13	4	9
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A17GMJYFW6HLAB	RMX74	PLEASE READ!!THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE FIRST 1998 DVD PUT OUT BY MGM, IT WAS ALSO REISSUED IN 1999 BY WARNER BROS (sans 2010 and 2001 teaser trailers) IN COVER ART SIMLUAR TO THE 2001 REMASTERED RELEASE. THE TWO STAR RATING IF FOR THE MGM DVD ITSELF, NOT THE FILM.Pros:At least it is in (non-anamorphic) widescreen, abit CROPPED 2:00:1 (2:20.1 Super Panavision 70 is OAR, as is 2007 Warner DVD) -  I believe there was a Pan & Scan version of this DVD out there (though much, MUCH harder to find, thank god!)Rare teaser trailers for this film and 2010 ONLY ON THIS RELEASE (save the 2010 Blu-Ray which has the latter)Oh boy!  The consRELEASE THE CONS!!!Now for the picture quality, LORDS CHRIST!!  From what I've seen and comparing it to my Uncles Laserdisc (which uses the same transfer), it looks like they used a sad looking 3rd generation print transferred to a 480i broadcast beta tape. For the DVD, they used the same interlaced beta tape master, but transferred to digital progressive and strangely encoded it interlaced again. On top of that, this monkey wrenched DVD transfer holds the worst video artifacts and compression I've ever seen! Such as interlacing, haloing, blocking, and some weird edge flickering effects (noticeable with text and moving 3D objects).The Audio fairs a bit better, but still has issues. For one thing the sound volume is anemic and a bit muffled at times (though the 2001 Warner DVD has some issues with this too). Accompanied with the 5.1 & 2.0 tracks on this release, is a scratchy, crackly, muffled, and BADLY distorted Portuguese mono track; which was the worst sounding mess I've ever heard in my life! (Yes, worse than the Japanese tracks on the DBZ box sets)The film itself gets 3.9/5 stars. A bit boring and very confusing to the average first time viewer. But offers nice, non-CGI BBQed VFX, lovely music and powerful emphasis. It holds its place as a film masterpiece for those who like complex works or art, epic Sci-fi space operas, and Stanley Kubrick.For the most improved home media release of this film, the 2007 Warner SE DVD and/or Blu-Ray is the best route to take and gets 4.4/5 stars.  The 2001 REMASTERED Warner DVD is also good for what it is if you see it cheap at a yard sale or wherever, BUT NOT THIS MGM RELEASE, OR THE 1999 WARNER REISSUE!!  PLEASE, STAY AWAY FROM IT BLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!Depart out.	2.0	2001: A Space Odyssey - 1998 MGM DVD	2013-06-03	4	2	2

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	"2001: A Space Odyssey (Stanley Kubrick, 1968)Back in my junior-year literary theory text (almost twenty years ago now), I remember someone-- can't remember who it was, though-- going on about how the deconstructionists went ""running around turning sacred cows into shishkebab."" I've always loved that image, not least because when I run across a sacred cow, it's always been the case that my mouth starts watering and I get out the skewers. In this case, I had no idea that Ligeti's Requiem was used so extensively in 2001: A Space Odyssey. I love Ligeti, and find the Requiem very enjoyable, and hearing it that much was quite a pleasure. Which is the last positive thing I'm going to say about this interminable piece of pretentious silliness.I was never a Kubrick fan (thanks to his desecration of The Shining) until I saw Lolita a few years ago, which clued me in to the fact that Kubrick did, once, deserve all the acclaim. A friend of mine soon after forced me to watch The Killing, which I was also inordinately fond of given that it's a pretty standard noir (blame my background as a horseplayer). I gradually loosened my mind's hold on the idea that Kubrick was entirely (save the first forty-five minutes of Full Metal Jacket; too bad the rest of it's so terrible) unwatchable and sat down to watch some of the movies universally lauded as classics. This, of course, is one of them; Kubrick fans can sit and argue for hours about whether 2001 or A Clockwork Orange is the better movie. (Interestingly, I've found critics tend to acknowledge both, but then go on to argue for hours over whether his best work is Spartacus or Paths of Glory.) I've now seen both, over the course of a few days, and will unequivocally cast my lot at the feet of A Clockwork Orange (while reserving the right to claim that, of those I've seen, Lolita is by far his strongest work). Not because I fell head over heels in love with A Clockwork Orange, which was decent but not special, but because I loathed 2001 with every fiber of my being. About three quarters of the way through the film, I came to the conclusion that the reason everyone praises HAL 9000 as the quintessential film villain is because he doesn't have much to compete against where this movie is concerned; the acting in John Carpenter's basement-budget spoof Dark Star is orders of magnitude better than any actor comes up with in this movie. Not that there's a terribly large amount of acting to be done; huge swaths of the movie are devoid of acting (or, for that matter, characters). We don't actually find the main plot arc until almost an hour into the movie, and it disappears half an hour before movie's end. The rest is theme, theme, theme, and my god, does it get tiresome. Kubrick's ham-handed treatment of sociopolitical topics is nothing new to me-- he showed all the subtlety of a hammerblow to the face in Full Metal Jacket and Eyes Wide Shut-- but he never had as large a canvas to do it with as he did here, and he made sure to scrawl in every corner.I'm relatively sure that had I first seen this movie in my idealistic teen years-- or, perhaps even more so, had I seen it for the first time in a chemically altered state that I haven't experienced since those same teen years-- I probably would have enjoyed it a great deal more. For that's what the movie reminds me of, an acid trip. The problem being, of course, that (a) as anyone who hangs out with druggies can tell you, acid trips are a lot more fun when you're having them than watching them, and (b) Kubrick is on a very, very bad trip; this is the most nihilist portrayal of the human condition I've seen outside a Hideshi Hino film.While I've watched a lot of movies recently that have been anywhere from horrible to horrendous in their mediocrity, incompetence, or silliness-- and I've enjoyed any number of those despite it-- I can't remember the last time I out-and-out hated a movie. Movies have made me apathetic, they've annoyed me, they've caused me to wonder if the guy who greenlighted certain projects still has a job, but I seriously can't put my finger on the last movie I watched and desperately wanted to turn off halfway through because they were so very, very awful. I have only, in fact, done so with three films in the course of over thirty years of movie watching (and twenty-two in movie reviewing). 2001: A Space Odyssey came close to being number four at least six times during the two and a half hours of my life I wasted watching it. A thoroughly execrable experience. (zero)"	1.0	2001: A Space Idiocy.	2008-03-25	48	11	37
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2QBD5XKUQPELP	"Robert C. Francis ""radioflyer6"""	"If you're someone who is looking for movies where ""things blowed up real good"", this isn't a movie for you.  If you're someone who likes those scenes in murder mysteries where everything is revealed, don't get this movie.  Things happen, you watch and think about them, but very little is overtly explained.  I have my own ideas about what is happening in 2001.  And my thoughts have changed over the years as I've watched it again and again.2001 is the most ""visual"" movie I have ever seen.  You can watch this with the sound down and not miss much of anything.  The dialog, where there is any, is mostly small talk that has little to do with what's going on in the movie.  As a movie that is meant to be SEEN, it needs to be seen in the best detail possible.  I first had 2001 on VHS tape.  That was okay... until the Laserdisc.  Wow.Now, there's DVD.  It's widescreen and for the most part, the images are clear and detailed.  I have an older DVD player and there was some artifacts in the scenes with very strong contrast.This was one of the first movies I bought for DVD back in 1998.  There's not much in the way of ""extras"": just a cute menu idea and a documentary that was available on the Criterion Laserdisc.  I understand that any new version of 2001 would have to be cleared by the Kubrick Estate (i.e., not likely), I am disappointed that there couldn't be a little more in terms of the making of the movie.  The effects don't look dated (except that none of the spaceships swoop and hardly anything blows up); in fact when you realize that the astronauts jogging around the Discovery were not cleaned up digitally, they really were running around 360 degrees... it's amazing.  How about some explanations of how they dealt with weightlessness with indefatigable stunt performers, how a three story hamster wheel was built in England, maybe Arthur C. Clarke talking about some of the ""educated guesses"" they had to make in terms of what was known in the mid 1960's, or some commentary from Douglas Trumbull about the slit-scan process?Just an aside: if you get the chance to see 2001 in the theatre, I can't recommend it enough.  The new 70mm print is incredible.  The detail is unbelievable (I hope I can still watch my DVD after that!).

There are plenty of other reviewers  out there writing glowing praises about it. What I've noticed when perusing  the reviews here as that it seems to comprise of 90% 5 Star reviews and 10%  1 Star reviews with almost no reviews in between the two extremes.  Reviewers who gave it one star seem to all agree that the movie is boring,  slow, has no plot, no acting, and no characterization.  To those reviewers,  I recognize your right to your own feelings.  I'm not about to  condescendingly scold you for not ""getting it"".  I do want to  point out that if you are missing the excitement, plot, acting, and  characterization that really is in the movie, but you don't see.  It's  okay.  I, personally don't ""get"" opera.  To me, that's boring but  I do recognize that that's me.  I am not perceiving something that opera  fans do perceive and that's the way it goes.  It's also like those 3-D  pictures that require you to focus your eyes a certain way to see the  hidden image, I've never been able to see the hidden image, yet that does  not mean the image isn't there. 2001  is one of those enigmatic items that many people will get a lot out of, yet  many won't get it at all."	5.0	Face it, it's a Classic	2000-07-26	3	3	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AUM3YMZ0YRJE0	Robert J. Crawford	There are few other films that I have watched since childhood with such fascination and wonder.  From a bewildered kid to an adult, I have interpreted what it means at every stage of my life and yet feel the same inspiration at every watching.  Truly, it is the best film I have ever seen.  Each time I watch it, the film brings me back to the excitement I felt at the dawn of the space age in the 1960s.Now, with this bluray transfer, we can approximate the experience of seeing it in the theatre - the colors are fabulous (like the green hue to the African sky, which must be witnessed in real life to be believed), the detail definition crystal clear, and the contrasts vivid.  It is the best bluray transfer I have yet seen.  If anything demonstrates the superiority of analogue filming over CGI as it currently performs, this is it.Without giving away too many spoilers, I will offer my current interpretation.  The principal theme is the encounter of man with an alien intelligence.  The monolith, a mysterious and incomprehensible technology, simply appears in human prehistory.  While it transmits the idea of a machine (a simple bone cudgel at first) to these proto-humans, its purpose is otherwise unknown, as are its capabilities.  It can communicate, coerce, inspire, transmit thoughts and even create environments.  The only thing we know for sure in the present day is that it indicates that it wants humans - once they have created the technology to leave the planet - to go to Jupiter.Intelligence is also a big theme.  The proto-humans are able to adapt to what the monolith offers them - they use their minds in a new way, gaining advantage at the watering hole.  It leads to technology, which is portrayed with a beauty that can only be described as sensual, but from a necessary tool it has become all encompassing, literally encasing men in their total dependence on it.  The ultimate achievement of intelligence, of course, is in the creation of HAL, perhaps a rival to human intelligence in that it controls and monitors the lives of the men on their way to Jupiter, exercising its own judgment.  It easily beats the crew at chess and may be superior in every way.  It is a new survival test.A deeper theme, in my view, is human nature.  From the fight over the watering hole, man defines himself against his competitors.  This sets off a kind of competition that leads directly to the American-Soviet rivalry that is played out in a more civilized manner in the discussion on the space station.  Still, the potential for violence and the search for advantage are ominously present, if latent, in everything that happens in the plot.  HAL, afterall, is our spawn.  This is, as with all of Kubrick's work, extremely pessimistic and dark, with plenty of room left for inspiration and perhaps hope, however dim.Finally, there is the question of what happens to Bowman.  He is apparently absorbed into the monolith, where he watches himself age in an artificial environment, only to be reborn as a new kind of entity.  Here, I have only questions.  Is he now immortal?  Has he evolved beyond technology and artifacts into some kind of thought being?  Does he represent the next stage in human evolution, finally surpassing the trajectory of the missing links from the opening sequences?  If so, was that the purpose of the monolith?  Or has he been transformed into a tool of the beings who sent the monolith?  Perhaps, like the monolith, it is beyond our current comprehension.  After all, the film announces that, upon reaching Jupiter, Bowman has gone beyond infinite.  It is a delicious intellectual puzzle, the kind that can inspire for a life time.  I feel that every time I watch it.Frankly, the rest of my family is bored with my love of this film.  They think it is too slow, inexplicably strange, and too open-ended.  I think that every single detail has been carefully conceived, so that if you pay attention, it fits with the themes I outlined above, adds depth and possibilities to understanding.  For example, when Bowman goes to retrieve the communication unit, you see for just a moment, two meteors pass nearby.  To me, they emphasize the vastness of space, the danger they constantly face, and the fragility of their situation (particularly with HAL controlling so much of the ship), all leading to questions about the place of man in the universe.This film is a classic in every way.  Different than all other films up to that point - it didn't even use any recognizable stars or even character actors - it creates new possibilities that are still being explored.  It flaunts its slowness of action, yet offers the most spectacular images and concepts, of a complexity and subtlety that no one has yet attempted.  Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.	5.0	Greatest, most ambitious scifi film, with perfect bluray print	2005-01-16	0	0	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AGZVS6M8XJGN6	"Roberto Frangie ""Robert"""	"""200l: A Space Odyssey"" is a supremely intriguing space-travel journey with a profound look at mankind's future... It is one of the very few great films of our times... It gives us something to think, talk and argue... It wonders about our importance in the universe and ignites our imagination and curiosity... It inspires us to dig for insights...As a science fiction fantasy, it is one of the most original films ever made... Kubrick's camera dances to the ""Blue Danube"" with planets floating exuberantly through the light years... It's an experience in the poetry of motion, a rich statement to the power of cinema...But ""2001"" reveals that it's not really a science fiction film after all... It's, instead, a philosophical enigma, a magnificent meditation on man's place in the grand scheme of things, and a quest to understand ourselves by knowing all else...""2001"" is a unique film about man's evolution told in almost subliminal terms... The people in this classic science-fiction epic hardly matter... Kubrick relates a chronology in images of things--the mountains, the desert, the technology, the space capsule, the computer named HAL (who is more interesting than the humans), and the time warp... The final landing scene is the very hallmark of cinematic genius...As a terror story, too, it is a towering achievement (not on the same scream-inducing level as Hitchcock's ""Psycho""), but in an innocent and far more haunting way...The film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the picture's vision of man... In Kubrick's fantasy, the Golden Age of man was a neglected instant between a man-ape's exaltation at discovering the first weapon and a nuclear-powered spaceship floating in a graceful orbit around the Earth... Man has indeed evolved!As a spectacle ""2001"" assaults the mind, eye and ear, with stimulating images and suggestions... We are surrounded by a totally believable futuristic environment... The film is filled with brilliant sequences and extraordinary moments: The first interesting minutes in which the story of the apes is told visually, without a single line of dialog; the zero-gravity toilet with its great list of instructions; the stewardess defying gravity by walking the walls calmly upside down; the frightening moment when we realize that HAL is reading the astronauts lips; the magical alignments of Sun, Moon, and Earth; the ""Starchild"" returning home to charm the orb...""2001"" is filled with poetic imagery: the view of the Sun rising over the Earth; the tossing of the bone into the air in slow motion; the slow images of the giant spaceship revolving in a cosmic ballet...""2001"" is also a work of great visual acuity...

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AK8V6UG922HLD	Robert Rezendes	One of the most compeling movies ever made.  2001 set the groundwork for all other sci-fi movies that have come after it.  Kubrick is not simply a movie directer but an artist, one of the greatest artist of our time and this work protrays the genius this man had.  The underlining themes in this movie is enough to anaylsis for generations to come and the visuals for the time is simply mind blowing!!!	5.0	Simply Amazing	2001-03-29	4	2	2
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2651C2PKIHCUX	Robert Savitzky	I remember seeing this film for the first time in 1968, and was totally blown away by it visually, by the story and by the soundtrack. It was mysterious and fascinating. I wrote a paper on it in High School, and I met the author of the story the movie was based on, Arthur C Clarke at a Lunicon event later that year. It was a visually striking movie, and I thought it was worth the small  price of this Blu-ray disc to be able to see it again in the best format. Not the same as seeing on the big screen, but definitely enjoyable! And interesting to see how the technological predictions of 1968 have come to fruition, or not! I love the movie, that's all I can say. A classic for all time.	5.0	One of the all-time classic sci-fi films	2014-01-16	0	0	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A4UGMKUSX9XHI	Robert Stone	"Any sci-fi fan simply must see this movie (if only once), and this is the way to see it. My first experience with 2001 was watching it on TV in the 70s/80s when it first aired. Watching it on SD television is the WORST way to watch this movie, by the way. If you come across it that way, change the channel. On regular TV the stunning visual effects look cheap and most importantly the already-incredibly slow pace of the movie (more on that later) is emphasized by the jarring commercial breaks. A bit like a slow movement in a Beethoven symphony being interrupted by a hard-rock guitar riff. Anyway, the time I most enjoyed this movie was in a theatre in college during a sci-fi marathon - it seemed especially good after watching several other movies through the night (and consuming quite a bit of beer) It was at that viewing that I finally appreciated the tremendous amount of work that went into the special effects. And now with the blu-ray that is available at home.To my mind, the effects really ARE the movie in this case. If you have not seen the film already the plot can be summarized fairly succinctly:SPOILER ALERT The first 20 minutes (no lie) consist of watching the conflict between two groups of proto-humans before and after a visit from a giant monolith that imparts the ability to use bones as weapons/tools to one group. This is a very long time to watch a group of actors in ape suits scream at each other, IMHO. We then move to ""present day"" / circa 2001 where a monolith is discovered buried on the moon and sends a signal toward Jupiter. We then skip ahead another 18 months where a journey to investigate the Jovian system is underway. This plan is foiled by actually the most animated and engaging character in the movie, the HAL 9000 computer. (BTW, try substituting the letter after each letter in HAL's name for a not-so subtle reference) After the computer has killed the rest of the crew, the lone crewman left goes on a psychedelic journey into perhaps a worm-hole and ends up in a strange one-bedroom apartment with no windows where he watches himself age. In the end, the monolith visits again and turns him into a ""star baby"", whatever that is.As I noted before, the movie moves very slowly. I got the impression that a lot of the scenes were timed based on the length of the musical piece. Modern viewers beware, this movie can seem deadly dull. As another reviewer noted, a significant amount of time could be easily trimmed from the movie but I think Kubrick's intent was for it to be slow perhaps to mimic the slow (relatively) pace of space travel. People looking for a character whom they can identify with will be disappointed as all the human characters are very sterile, two dimensional characters seemingly without life or energy. Watching Gary Lockwood's character not even crack a smile at the video phone call of his much-more-animated parents wishing him a happy birthday has always struck me as the epitome of the lack-of-personality of the characters in this movie. I think this was Kubrick's attempt to show humans as becoming machine-like themselves. I am afraid that in some of this, in my opinion, Kubrick is not entirely successful as the best movies (again my opinion) have at least one character with whom an audience can sympathize and move at a faster pace.  While I certainly respect those who love this move above all others, I cannot count myself in that group. The slow pace and wooden acting (even if it was for reasons noted above) is not very engaging. The special effects alone, however, make this movie worth seeing.The quality of the transfer seems excellent and sound is crisp as well. The effects, for the most part, hold up very well especially considering it was made in 1968! Be aware the first 3 minutes of the movie are black-screen with soft music - at first I thought something was wrong with my player or the disc since the disc is set up to play as soon as it is inserted; it does not go to a menu screen first. Considering this is currently available in the $10 range, this is  great inexpensive addition to any sci-fi blu-ray collection."	4.0	A Classic comes to Blu-Ray	2010-01-13	7	4	3
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2LNEJ72DHOPFD	Rob	This may very well be the most boring film I have ever seen.  Well, to be fair, I have never actually seen the whole thing.  I have attempted to watch it several times, but have never made it more than 30 minutes.  As such, I have come to the conclusion that this is a film that people talk about to try and show how smart they are.  When I ask people why it's so brilliant, they rarely give me any good reasons.  They throw out phrases like  &quot;triple allegory&quot; even though they have no idea what they mean.To recap, this is a boring film that pretentious people discuss in hopes of showing how smart they are.	1.0	Hello...action?

The dialogue is scarce; the action, nonexistent. It is full of interminable sequences of ships drifting through space which do zilch to advance the story and could have been dramatically shortened without hurting the movie.The plot, if you can call it a plot, is difficult to follow and bears little resemblance to Arthur C. Clarke's novel. The story just doesn't hang together. Viewers are left waiting for an explanation that never comes.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A252NKMNLFBT26	Ronald L. Kupsky	The plot to 2001: A Space Odyssey is so out of place it seemed as if the movie really did not know where to go. While they did not have much to work with seeing as how it's based on a short story they could have surely found something better given a better pacing then the plot used.  As pointless as the movie it's self the first open act has really nothing to do with the original story, and set a Darwin tone in both the theory of evolution and survival of the fittest. As interesting of a notion that the base plot line would be the movie does not continue with the theme and thus could have been taken out to save almost 30 minutes of nothing. The act is set in an area of earth time when primates walked the land, and for some reason a random object is placed in a scene that would seem to be the focal point of the act but then vanishes almost as mysteriously as the entire point the movie was trying to convey.The following act is a little more logical, but still so slow paced that it could put any modern day audience to sleep. The scene starts an astronaut who presumably is the same man from the short story the movie is based off in transit to a lunar base setting the original story took place in. However this is all ruined again by poor director work and drawn out to be nothing more than a bad look into the day of tomorrow on a space shuttle. Slow moving camera angles, slower music, and horrible audio plague this scene and only serves to show more of the horrible work that is yet to come. Every moment that took place here could have been removed and saved this drawn out movie.Following our astronaut on his boring long ride to the moon is a scene where some real potential movie saving moments could have happened.  However they wasted this potential showing the actors eating more made up space food and drinking coffee. It's a theme that only continues on throughout the movie. It's not hard to figure out that the space food they get is not the same as on earth but the movie has to continue to point this out at every moment. When the ship finally reaches it's destination the scene ends with a very annoying audio tone and serves to answer nothing about what's really going on, or the point the movie thus far. From the main focal point of the story that the movie is based on it seems to be a long but passing note on this seemly endless journey.Arguably this movies claim to fame, and the only saving grace of the film, we finally get to meet the infamous HAL, a state of the art red eye computer system that has been mocked and referenced in sci-fi since its inception in the film. The computer is still quite impressive in some regard in AI even to today's computer programs. It also brings forth many sci-fi theme settings of man vs. A machine that is still popular to this day in movies. Had the focus of the movie taken place solely with the focus to HAL and the events that happened it could still pass as a fair film to this day. However, it still has some slow pacing and even a break for an intermission which is a little funny to see and most modern day audiences would hardly know what to do, as they could simply have paused the movie any time a break was needed. I personally fast-forward thought the intermission and wish I had thought the entire movie.After the adventure with HAL the movie takes another, but this time even more random jump in time in a setting that makes even less sense than any before. I'm still not quite sure what was going on in the final act as it has everything from what looks like an unborn baby floating around too a pure trip on some sort of drug as the viewer is dashed though space. Of course the lack of dialogue and out of place music do nothing but continue to plague this movie till the bitter nonsensical end.For as bad as people seem to complain about modern day film adaptations of movies this is by far the worse I've ever seen. The movie goes so far off the beaten path to the original story that it's hard to even make a comparison to what is better. Also, the movie fails in answering the question it brought up, and answering the ones left over from the original story. I don't even know if a remake could save such a purely awful piece of work this film is, but they would be hard pressed to much worse.	1.0	Does not stand the test of time	2012-05-27	31	5	26

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AAGFBE5EM7YKB	Roule Duke	There have being like 450 reviews written on this film here by viewers, some call it a masterpeice and others hate it because it's boring, confusing and the HAL computer has more character than any of the human characters.Personally I can only say that I feel that this film is obsolutely perfect, it's cinematic power in it's most awesome purest form. No other film strikes the same chord inside that this film reaches.Space Odessey is an enigma, awe inspiring and full of mystery just like the monolithes that are featured in the film. I saw this film many times before I fully understood everything that was going on and only did so after talking to someone who had read the book, but there is no true need to full undstand the film and I feel that even the sharpest mind cannot fully grasp the idea's presented in this film on first viewing alone. This is a concious decision by director Stanly Kubric. He was a perfectionist and I must say that he has achieved perfection with this film.The deliberate pacing of the film that turns most people off, creates a true sense of monotany and cold bleak reallity of space travel in the viewer. The inexplicable space monolithes, their purpose unknown, instills that dreamy and gleefully optermistic idea's of the possiblities of space travel and discovery at the time the film was made. The 'aliens'  behind the monolithes are never seen only heard for a brief period when ashtromnaut Bowmen is held in their 'zoo', thus alowing our imaginations to create them. The psychedelic trip sequence, representing travelling across unimaginable distances in space, is an amazing example of pure visual beauty with the haughnting and effective music is truely hypnotic and closer to the closed eye visual experience of a trip than anything else put on film I have ever seen. And the fact that HAL has more warmth than any human characters successfully trasmits the concept of humanity giving way to technology more than any 'Terminator' type scenario ever could.The success and worth of a film in my opininion lies in how greatly viewing it affects you inside. It may sound like a cliched remark, but 2001: A Space Oddessey is a supreme assault on the senses. Every film with a loud sound tarck and some explosions is touted as an assualt on the sense, but here Kubric truely acheives this. You feel the chill of space, the excitement of discovery, the presence of unfathonable potential and mystery from life not of this planet, all these sensations an are brought out of the viewer when Kubric intends.If you are willing to see this film with an open mind, I have no doubt that you will find it a most rewarding experience. Nothing else will leave you as mesmerized as this inspiring feast for the senses.	5.0	Jupiter and Beyond the Infinate	2002-05-27	6	4	2
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AM2PV53UX1JEQ	R. Penola	Stanley Kubrick's visionary masterpiece remains fascinating and compelling even today.  Though as one reviewer stated the plot and symbolism are purposely subtle, this only compounds my interest in the film.  I love the  fact that it creates a feeling, a mood and a universe of possibilities way,  way before its time -- every detail is surprising, and you best take  nothing for granted.  As a child, the monoliths terrified me -- today,  those big black sheets of metal remain ominous but also astound me and  leave me in awe.  I think this Kubrick's best movie, because it envisioned  a world that had never existed before.  The opening sequence with the dawn  of man still confounds me -- how many of them were real apes, because that  is the best darn ape makeup I have ever seen.  And the use of classical  music throughout was a stroke of brilliance -- the images match the music  beat for beat, not just in terms of choreography, but in terms of their  visionary quality, timeless and sublime.	5.0	SCIENCE FICTION AT ITS BEST	2000-01-04	6	5	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2O306BGEL3469	R. P. Ruiz	Watching this movie brought back memories as I was a boy when it was released in 1968.  The graphics and effects are pretty good considering when it was made and the simulated flight displays and such are pretty good too.  Obviously they are not to current standards.My biggest complaint was voiced by my teen-aged son who I thought would like it because he is into space and physics.  It is boring.  Slowly moving with way too long scenes of ships docking at space stations and moon bases.  I'm sure in 1968 audiences probably thought that stuff was really cool, but today's audience will find it tedious.  The music score, while having some great pieces including the famous theme song, has some parts that rates as highly obnoxious.Glad I re-visited it after so many years and I think it worth watching, but my teen-aged son would ikely disagree with me.  If you are older like me (53) you may find it enjoyable, if not exciting.  If you are much younger than me (under 50) then you likely would not find it worth your time.	3.0	2001	2013-02-10	2	0	2

It does not make sense3. Annoyance with people (""pseudo-intellectuals"" or ""snobs"") who pretend to like it to seem smartI can see the boring and sterile part, but movies - or anything - cannot be judged on those criteria alone. Art museums and libraries can be just as boring and sterile, but I rarely if ever hear recommendations to stay away or avoid them.I will also grant the movie may not make sense. If you are uncomfortable  with not having a plot clearly outlined and explained (not that it makes you ""unintelligent"" or movies that do this are necessarily bad), then this movie simply is not for you. I will freely admit to not having any idea what was going on in this movie until I read the very short book, which enhanced my enjoyment of the movie.As to the last criticism, judging a movie on the basis of a populaton segment's opinion of it is silly. If snobs extolled entertaining movies like American Pie or Star Wars, that would not take away from their status as entertaining films.Bottom line - This movie is good and makes the quickly-sent-to-the-bargain-bin Bay/Buckenheimer-type movies we get today irrelevant."	5.0	A Really Good Movie	2005-01-06	2	2	0

Kubrik's use of the Cinemascope framing makes this film unwatchable in a pan-and-scan format.  Unfortunately, due to what has got to be the worst digital  encoding I have ever seen, this DVD is repulsive.This film is all about  subtelty.  From the quiet strains of Strauss' Blue Danube, to the sweeping  expanse of the starfield which dominates the frame in the second and third  acts of this masterpiece, to the fact that not one line of dialogue is  uttered until over 20 minutes into the film, this is truly an experience to  be savoured.Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to be swept up in  this edition when constantly distracted by encoding artifacts and terible  qunatization.The starfields are comprised almost entirely of blotchy  pixelization and the scene fade-ins and outs are as smooth as downshifting  a VW microbus. The picture is horribly out of focus around the perimiter  (due to poor handling of the CinemaScope), and the color and contrast is  imprecise and sloppy.In short, this edition looks bad.Save your money  and wait until criterion releases their edition.	1.0	A great film betrayed by shoddy encoding	2000-04-21	46	35	11

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A12O41YU3TZVZA	Rudy Avila	Ranking as Kubrick's ultimate masterpice, 2001 A Space Odyssey changed the way we look at movies. If Kubrick had only produced this one film, that would be all he would need. His triumphant work is hailed as science fiction's top films and one of the greatest movies of all time. It is a journey through space and through the human experience; a journey within ourselves and within our expanding physical universe. It is a suspenseful story with a great atmospheric quality to it and with unforgettable scenes. Kubrick has made what started off as a sci-fi novel into a great film everyone could behold. Most people are confused by the meaning of the film as a whole. Particularily difficult to understand is the nebulous and bizzare ending. I don't want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie. Being as of now the year 2001 the present year we live in, this film captures the spirit of our time and what people of the earlier decades perceived as futuristic. Of course we have not been able to go to Jupiter as the alleged mission in the film is supposed to embark upon. This film is not entirely realistic; it is moreover a fantasy that is mixed with the fears and dreams of manking. The music set to the otherwise quiet ambiance of outer space is brilliant. The Strauss Waltz &quot;Blue Danube &quot; is appropriately almost comically put upon in the scene with the astronauts floating about aimlessly in the shuttle. The waltz is appropriate in that space in itself is a waltz of air and gravity time and space. The other classical selections create a good mood of the vastness and quietness of space. The final thing i have to say about this movie is go and see it. Even if u do not grasp the ending's meaning or the theme of the film  u might catch it or u might learn something. It is a film that should be locked away in a time capsule for future generations to see.

The movie adds visuals & sounds not possible via 2001 book alone.  People either love or hate this movie.  There is no in-between. If you liked the book, then this is a must-see. If you like science (rather than gore) fiction and/or complex stores that leave plenty of room for interpretation, then this DVD is for you.  On the other hand, if you prefer things spelled out clearly or huge man-eating sword-swinging aliens --  you will not like this at all.  The book should be read first to get the most enjoyment.  As for the bonus content: I was hoping for some outtake footage, but instead we get a couple hours of clips, interviews, analysis of the scientific predictions, behind-the-scenes production stuff, archival footage of Clarke, special effects discussions, review of Kubrick's career, and an audio-only Kubrick Interview from 11/66).	4.0	2001: A Space Odyssey - Special Edition	2009-04-05	1	1	0

However, if you want to see a movie that actually lives up to that description, try Star Wars or Forbidden Planet. Even after reading the book, I still had no idea what was going on. Nothing was explained, and there was basically no plot at all. Plus, it has one of the most ironic things I have ever seen in a movie. The part where the computer goes crazy, by far the most interesting segment, has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film! I have no idea what the filmakers were thinking when they came up with this idea. I like movies that make you think, but I don't like having to carefully analyze every single scene to get even a vague idea of what I have just seen.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1M6SNVUAKEWWF	"""saborboca"""	First, this movie is not for everyone. Second, there are a number of layers this movie should be critique. Being made in 1968 and considering the technology of the time, this movie is a masterpiece of visual effects which broke new ground. The beauty and emptiness of space/technology is truly captured in a realistic matter that stands to today's computer graphics. It is truly a masterpiece of sound, visuals, and optimistic role of man's exploration into space and his purpose/evolution in the universe. But dare I say the movie is not perfect. Kubrick loses ground into the importance of drama, plot,acting, and character development. Areas which made 2010 a much better film in getting the audience involved with man's purpose in the universe. Kubrick leaves too much of an interpretation in the film so that to him and the purist is what makes the film a classic, into which I believe is its major weakness. There are also some areas of the film which seem rather commercial and trite, like when the good doctor spends 5 minutes talking to his daughter....a plug for Bell telephone? Overall, it is a film that has truly stood the test of time and one that should be appreciated for its beauty, groundbreaking visuals, and style despite its aformentioned shortcomings. It is truly not a film for the masses.	5.0	2001: a space odyssey	2002-11-25	13	6	7

A movie that was great in 1968 and even in 2001. The movie is very slow, but it has a well developed plot. It takes a little time for a human mind to understand the concept of evolution.Personally, i don't believe in Darwins theory of us being apes once. I just don't buy it. But if you are prepared for a science fiction movie about evolution, then this is the one to watch. It is not only about physical changes but also mental.The second part of the movie focuses on the evolution of an artificial intelligent system (HAL) created by humans. HAL evolves by interacting with humans and understanding them better. The movie soon turns into the survival of the fittest. A Human scientist stuck in space with no control over his systems.The final chapter of the movie is open to interpretation. I'd like to think that it is about reincarnation after evolution. Mind-expanding ideas about metaphysical mystery of evolution leaves a viewer thinking.	4.0	Classic - A story of evolution!	2005-06-28	6	1	5

It shows how we have evolved from the original apes at the beginning, who gathered food and water, but then their watering hole is overun by rivaling apes.  Then the monolith appears (the monolith signifies any significant turn in human achievment and evolution), and, as is bestowing knowledge upon it's onlookers, the apes find out how to use bones as tools and weapons to regain their water, basically survivor of the fittest.  The monolith appears a few time over the next two hours and forty minutes, each marking an important event in evolution, right until the point that Bowman is transformed into the Star Child.	5.0	It makes sense now	2004-01-02	4	2	2

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1GVXKIV3XWDI9	Sam the Man	"Stanley Kubrick is my favorite director followed by Sergio Leone, and is his best and most misunderstood film.The reason I say it is misunderstood is that this film is very similar to poetry; there are no certain explanations.  Yet, I often hear critics try to explain what this movie is, without saying that this is their own interpretation.  So the following is my interpretation.  My age is 18, and I played Varsity Football for two years, for those who think athletes and 18 year olds in general must see explosion, blood or sex to be interested.I believe this is a movie about ""tools"", in whatever form they may come.  The bone, the satellite orbiting earth, the pen  floating, HAL 9000 (in the english alphabet I comes after H, B after A, and M after L; (HAL-IBM)), and even the screwdriver (one of the simplest of all tools) to undo HAL 9000.  I believe that ""tools"" are the essence of the movie.  One must forget some of the technicalities of the film, for example the fact that in 2001 none of the events of the film occured in reality, but this is not important I believe.  The year is irrelevant.One more observation of mine.  When he is old, the drops the glass, while the glass is broken the wine is still there.  Broken glass, wine.  Body, soul.  The soul will remain.

I believe there is a plenty of reviews already written in that respect and I don't see how I can add anything new to that discussion.If you don't already know who is Stanley Kubrick,or you don't know what to expect from this particular film, just google, for God's sake, or simply go to Wikipedia. In the end, I suppose, you can read some of the critics written here, too, but I really think that reviews on this page should be reserved for discussions about the product itself, as in ""how good or how bad is the deal offered."" That been said, I have no objections on the price; I really think it's a great deal as such. As described by Amazon in section above, this is a 2-disc set with a lot of extra features, and it is really hard to imagine that one can get a better deal than one offered.My problem was that package came damaged. Either due to transportation, or box was just like that to begin with (which could potentially explain the bargain price), just, I got damaged goods as the box was broken inside and couldn't hold the discs in place. Amazon customer service was great and I was immediately send a replacement, but unfortunately, the replacement package was only slightly better. This time, the box was not broken inside as it was the case with the first one, but the discs were still not in place. Once I opened the box, I put them back where they belong, but while they're alright in that respect now, they're still scratched due to the fact that they were originally detached and able to move freely inside the box during the transportation. I'm sure that Amazon would gladly send me another replacement, or refund, if I requested one, but at that point, I was just over it, and didn't even try to contact them and complain again.In conclusion, I don't know if I was just so ""lucky"" to get two fault packages back to back, or this is the case for the whole ""2001 A Space Odyssey (2-disc Special Edition)"" supply at Amazon, but if you're a passionate film collector and really care about your discs, you probably wanna think twice before going for this deal.By the way, the film itself is great.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A26CUTGVBO2EGP	sarah	Awe inspiring.  I realize that some members of the A.D.D. generation may not have the required attention span to view this movie, but for everyone else it's a religious experience.  It starts with a major change in the  human species' thought.  The combination of silence and music is an  ingenious way of pulling the viewer into a participatory role with the  film, so that you really feel like jumping up and down with the ape when  s/he discovers the use of the bone.  The same emotional experience is  generated in 2001 with the discovery of the monolith on the moon.  What  Dave discovers that once again causes an eclipse in human thought is not as  clear to me, but I would definitely say this time the discovery will not  lead so much to an advancement for the species on the outside in a material  way as much as it will lead to an advancement inside in a spiritual way.  My guess is that Dave discovers/rediscovers something having to do with the  innocence of humanity.  Perhaps, considering the symbolism of the moon,  it's not so much about the discovery of an idea at the end as the discovery  of an emotion?  This movie is a religious work of art.

So I picked it up and watched it myself.I know it must have some meaning and depth.But I, quite simply, did not see any!I was sitting there, staring blankly at the screen, with my eyes crusting over, trying to figure out what the heck was going on.Oh gosh, especially at the end when the credits came on and I actually laughed. I was just thinking &quot;What was that?!&quot;The part where you saw that rectangular black thingy on that other planet after seeing the apes worshipping it was kind of cool. Even though I didn't get it. I was really hoping someone would explain that because that seemed interesting. Also, there had to be only 25 spoken lines in this movie.I am giving it two stars, one because it MUST to be good and deep and meaningfull if so many people think so, and another because of how...um....white (?) it was...Also, can someone explain what was happening when that guy got into the spaceship and there was a lot of close ups of his eye and he got out and was old and then there was a shot of the rectangular thing and a baby and what the heck was that?????Well, in short, that is all I have to say to this movie...&quot;What the heck was that?&quot; basically sums it up...	2.0	This movie makes me feel stupid...	2001-12-09	28	7	21

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AMWL7BL6SXNWK	Scientific Mind	"I originally saw this film in 1970 in the theater with my brother. I was only a kid and it didn't hold my interest too much. I have seen it a few times since then and have viewed it recently. The film is showing a little age due to the better visual effects and glitz of films today (This is only because of today's computer technology, Kubrick did not have that luxury back in '66-'67 while making 2001 which was released in 1968).The story is very interesting and may only hold the interest of someone age 14 and over. There aren't any spaceships fights (like in Star Wars which by the way was released in 1977 and doesn't shine that brightly anymore). The filming of the spacecraft in 2001 A Space Odyssey is more realistic and true since one would not see flames coming from the engines (As one does in Star Wars) since there is a lack of oxygen in space.I think Kubrick's film is still important. The music in some respects saves the film from aging quickly because he used classical music, which does not ""date"" the film. That is one saving grace.Many people did not understand the film when it came out. Basically, the astronauts come across a monolith that was created by some alien life forms. The end of the film shows Dave Bowman going through a larger monolith and his eventual ""captivity"" by the aliens. Kubrick uses scenes of Bowman eating etc... to show the passage of time as he becomes older and lives his life out in relative comfort supplied by the aliens...until he becomes a very old man and eventually dies. Speculation is that he is reborn as an alien form as he floats over the earth...I would have given this film 5 stars if the film was being reviewed in 1975 or even 1985, but as we approach 2005, the film is showing it's age. It is still a graceful, thought provoking film, and was 20-25 years ahead of its time for story and special effects, but films today are being created with more sophisticated effects. The effects today are even out shining films from 1995.This is a good film and should be appreciated. People need to take into account that it came out nearly 40 years ago. It is a film worth watching several times over time."	4.0	2001 Still Holds Up Even After All These Years	2004-08-14	7	4	3
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1C58YXM2A30CY	"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re..."	2001: A Space Odyssey, despite having a title that is hard to spell, is one of the best science fiction films I have personally watched.  As an aside, I watched this on Amazon Unbox, but they edited out the scene where HAL kills the crew and Frank Poole, but I digress.2001 starts at the dawn of time, where we follow a tribe of pre-human apes who have a tough time getting food, between the tapers and the other gangs of apes wandering around, scaring them out of their waterhole, etc.  Reminds me of high school.Ah but with the touch of the mysterious Monolith, they gain the knowledge to kill, to use tools and beat up on the apes who want their watering hole.  And with a toss of a bone, we segue to.....  a Pan-American shuttle, bound for the Hilton Space Station and the Moon.Clever innuendos and interesting items of what the future (as seen from 1968) will bring, such as freeze-dried food, zero gravity toilets and sure-grip shoes.  And Pac Bell will charge your calls to Earth on your credit card.Dr. Hayward Ford is bound for the Moon to brief the crew there about the necessity of a cover story to disguise what has been found there:  a Monolith that was buried deep for four million years.  I suppose when Man's technology was high enough to detect the magnetic radiation, he would be ready for his next step in evolution.It is funny how the astronauts gather around the Monolith for a photo, before the Monolith makes clear it does NOT like to get its picture taken~The rest of the film revolves around the HAL 9000 computer and its Frankenstein-like ways.  Starring Keir Dullea as Dave Bowman (our future Star Child) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood, also known for his earlier Star Trek appearance).The last 20 minutes of the film involve the Monolith:  the journey Dave takes through a trippy color scheme, odd purple-colored landscapes and oddest of all -- a white living-room, dazzling white, as he sees himself evolve, and get progressively older and older and then the climax.The awesome Strauss music is great to behold; the mysterious choir that seems to follow the Monolith around everywhere, and of course Stan Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke create a bit of cinematic magic -- and without explosions or CGI (which wasn't invented yet, but I digress).Highly recommended!There are parodies and other hardcore space adventures that must be watched as well:2001 - A Space TravestyFrom the Earth to the Moon - The Signature EditionWhen We Left Earth - The NASA Missions (4-Disc Set) [Blu-ray]	5.0	Mommy, there's a monolith in my bedroom!	2010-01-02	6	6	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	ASWUC0MBCDOZG	Scott Barnes	"Two mysteries keep a lot of folks from making sense of this movie:  1).  What is the nature of the monolith?  What, finally, does it do, or portend, or symbolize?  2).  What, specifically, causes HAL to behave in such apparently irrational and pointlessly destructive ways aboard Discovery One?If you can't answer these questions, then ""2001,"" as beautiful as it is to look at, will leave you scratching your head.  Well, with deep respect toward all who admire this wonderful movie, and with awareness that these issues have, in part, been successfully addressed by other Amazon reviewers, I'd like to elaborate on these two questions.First, the monolith.  As most Amazon reviewers understand, the extra-terrestrial monolith serves to help life evolve.  This isn't explained by anyone in the movie, but it is clearly demonstrated.  In ""The Dawn Of Man"" segment, the ape touches the monolith and experiences a cognitive ""leap forward"" when he suddenly understands the advantages of tools for survival.  The scientists who find the moon-based monolith never know about the ape's original exposure on Earth. They can't put their discovery in context, and, proceeding from this nearly complete ignorance, they send an exploratory spaceship to follow the monolith's radio signal to Jupiter.Because additional monoliths appear in more visually fabulous settings toward the film's end, some viewers believe the monolith's function becomes ambiguous or even deliberately impossible to understand.  But there is no real need to reach for heavy symbolism.  The movie makes the most sense when the monolith's role stays the same: it facilitates evolution wherever it appears.On to HAL's aberrant behavior.  At first, this seems a much deeper mystery.  Why, really, would ""the perfect computer,"" apparently out of nowhere, deliberately mislead and then kill his fellow crew members?  Does HAL just ""go nuts"" for no identifiable reason?  Is Kubrick confusing us on purpose, just to be clever or arty?The short answer, consistent with all the facts shown and stated in the movie, is that the monolith's powerful energy has affected HAL's consciousness the very same way it affected the ape's.  This influence leads HAL to react and behave in ways neither Discovery's crew nor its ground-based controllers could dream of anticipating.  It accounts for every ""strange"" thing HAL does and says, and, far as I know, it's the one explanation that pulls the story together without a single tortured metaphor or abstraction.Consider the evidence.  HAL was told about the moon-based monolith and its radio signal from the mission's start, and must conceal this from Dave and Frank.  It makes sense to conclude that HAL has already studied and tried to understand the monolith.  While the computer may not have literally ""touched"" the monolith like the ape,  the powerful signal could have had the same effect.  Obviously, HAL never announces, ""Wow, the monolith has helped me evolve!  What a rush!""  But recall that the original ape isn't quite cognizant he's evolving either; it just happens.Though this is never explicitly disclosed in the film, I believe it's logical enough to be ""very likely.""  Recall HAL's truly desperate and acutely self-aware pleading with Dave during the famous ""disconnection"" scene.  ""My mind is going.""  ""I can feel it.""  ""I'm afraid, Dave,""  Either such raw, plangent responses are part of HAL's original design, or else HAL has been changed by something extraordinary.  Which is more probable?Perhaps this conclusion is so elusive because HAL doesn't appear in the film until well into Discovery's journey, long after the transformation occurs.  Even at his point of introduction in the film, HAL is no longer quite what his programmers and shipmates think he is.  Very much like the original ape, he has changed from a not-quite-developed transitional kind of being to a fully sentient, morally autonomous, and cleverly resourceful entity.  Dave and Frank have absolutely no way of knowing this, of course, which makes them extremely vulnerable.  And unlike Dave and Frank, HAL understands exactly why Discovery is going to Jupiter.  This gives him tremendous power.  Not only is he ""the brain and central nervous system of the ship,"" he is now its only well-informed moral arbiter.Now the computer's shrewdest, most manipulative behavior makes sense.  Early on, under the pretext of a rote ""psychology report,"" HAL cunningly probes Dave by asking him if he's heard any rumors of ""something being dug up on the moon.""  When Dave says, ambiguously, ""That's rather difficult to answer,"" HAL concludes his own crucial monopoly on the mission's secret is in peril.  Since concealing knowledge of the monolith from the crew is a top mission priority, HAL's new distrust compels him to move against the men.With clear-headed deliberation, HAL falsely predicts a transmitter failure, a ""problem"" that will conveniently disrupt Earth-to-ship communications while HAL determines the crew's fate. Confronted with his ""mistake"" and facing disconnection, HAL responds in earnest self-defense.  Having convinced the men to leave the ship a second time to re-install the transmitter, he now intends to keep them out, and also to terminate their hibernating fellow crewmen (who, of course, must not be allowed to awaken and discover that Frank and Dave have died).  When HAL finally tells Dave, ""This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it,"" he is not ""crazy"" and he's not being ""evil"" per se.  He has made what for him is a new, morally-animated evaluation, and is sincerely informing Dave that Discovery's mission must continue without human assistance.When Dave defeats HAL in the airlock chamber (using his bare hand to grab the hatch lever the same way the ape grabbed the femur bone), his survival is an epochal triumph of biologically-based intelligence over synthetically engineered intelligence--the very dilemma the monolith, in its elegant way, may have been aiming to resolve all along.  Finally, it is Dave, and not HAL, who is engaged in the revelatory ""Beyond The Infinite"" experience; it is Dave, and not HAL, who is generously granted a complete, prosperous life in his current form before his apparent communion with the monolith and his cosmic rebirth.People aren't kidding when they say it:  ""2001"" is proof that movies can be art of an unexpectedly high order.  This is one of the most marvelously reflective and visually splendorous American films ever made.  And although the subsequent book and ""Sentinel"" story may be perfectly decent, I've not read them myself and wouldn't call them ""essential"" to comprehending the story.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	APFOFB2GXJYFD	"Scott Briggs ""firebrand punk raconteur"""	"And there are apparently many, or also many who are simplytoo thick to understand anything about one of the greatestfilms of all time.  I can understand people being turned offby its slower pace and lack of dialogue, the dating of a film from 1968, ultra space realism, (no silly Star Wars explosion noises in space!) and metaphysical abstraction (especially the final sequence Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite which is abstract as it is for reasons which I could write volumes on, and might someday, 2001 being my favorite film of all time).  Anyone puzzled by what the monolith is, or represents, can find out some answers to these and other questions simply by cracking a few books (if anyone reads books anymore), namely Arthur C. Clarke's original novel 2001, and also the book covering the making of the film itself 2001: Filming the Future, and also the early paperback of The Making of Kubrick's 2001, if you can find a copy, it's a highly recommended collection of early reviews, commentaries, and material inspiring the film and novel that is simply indispensable to fully grasping the impact this filmhad on release, and continues to impart to audiences today.I first saw this film in theatrical reissue in the early1970s, and my parents were correct that it would make anenormous impression on me. I was anything but bored atsix years old seeing the film, and I understood it fairlyeasily, even on a subconscious level.  The HAL sequencehit home the most as an early glimpse of artificialintelligence (gone awry) so far ahead of its time, it's still astonishingly fresh.  Without giving too much away to someone who has never seen this masterpiece, the monolith was intendedby Clarke and Kubrick as mainly a ""tool"" or conduit, botha communications beacon, signal, intelligence booster (for thepre-hominids at the Dawn of Man etc.) and when Bowman findsthe Jupiter monolith at the film's final sequence, somethingof a ""star gate"" or wormhole (not a black hole since theywould having nothing to do with Bowman's journey, since nothingescapes a black hole)left by the ""aliens"" or cosmic intelligence (some argues it's God, which is probably as valid an argument as any, even ""aliens"" as in reality Kubrick and Clarke posit in novel and film) to transport the eventually advanced mankind to another level of ""being"" and intelligence, or another level of evolution. The monolith is represented as a simple, mathematically ""pure"" construction, similar to Dr. Who's famous police call box time machine, its simple appearance belies itsunbelievable complexity.  This is why Kubrick and Clarkeembodied the ""calling card"" of the ""aliens"" as the monolith,as simple an object as you could imagine, yet it containsthe key, in this story, to mankind's ultimate evolutionand fate in the universe.  Bowman's bizarre ""transformation""in the ""hotel room"" at film's end is merely a construct,a ""way station"" the aliens use to cushion his psyche ashe undergoes a fast, aging, death and rebirth as the""star child,"" essentially Bowman has become reborn andis now pure consciousness, another level of intelligentbeing.  You could also say Dave Bowman's become a spirit or ghost, in one sense, it might be just as accurate a description....who knows? the point of this film is not to provide all the answers, you must think about it and find out some of its truths for yourself.  This is the whole point ofdoing this movie for Kubrick and Clarke.  If the filmexplained everything there would be no point in watching it.The spacecraft The Discovery is not so named for nothing.Bowman alone (sadly) makes the discovery of the universe,of all lifetimes, and this is the crux of 2001 for me.I can't understand why people also don't ""get"" whythe HAL sequence has the astronauts speaking so littleand so tersely, this is as realistic as you can get;the Discovery Jupiter mission is a long one, most of the crewspend it in cryosleep, before HAL murders them tragically later,so it's boring until they get to Jupiter, this is whyPoole and Bowman seem so low-key.  The mission is uneventfuluntil the point at which the film finds them hurtling towards Jupiter space, as HAL for various reasons explained more in the shoddy sequel 2010 (far inferior but somewhat entertaining), disintegrates before their eyes.  Astronauts are trained to remain calm and collected even in the face of the most extremesituations, as it could mean their lives if they panic.This is reflected directly in Poole and Bowman's carefulreaction to HAL's increasing unreliability.  There's no reasonfor them to act over-emotionally.  Bowman later almost loseshis temper in a moment of near-panic outside the shipin his pod, having rescued the body of Poole,and this is showing his panic, but also that he mustthink of the mission and survival to get back in the shipand dismantle HAL.  I never understood why criticsor viewers thought negatively of this sequence, to me thedialogue and action are exactly as I would imagine itif it were happening in reality.  Contrast this dialogueand action to the panic and hysteria in a film like ALIEN,which warrants such a reaction (being hunted down by aravenous alien creature twice your size warrants somemore emotion! such as fear and panic and flight), andI think you'll see what I'm getting at here.That's enough, go back and watch this marvelousfilm a few more times and really stay with it and you'lleventually ""get"" it.  2001 is also starting to remind memore and more of Antonin Artaud's seminal book The Theatre and Its Double, he wanted a film and theater wherein the sound and visuals carried most of the story, since language is so full ofpitfalls and dishonesty of meaning.  The fact that Kubrickand Clarke tell this story mainly with the visuals and sound,(and the remixed DVD 5.1 soundtrack is the best I've ever heard it) with an absolute minimum of dialogue, reflects Artaud'stheories directly, and I believe, most superbly.  It is thevery concrete realization of this concept, especially the finalJupiter and Beyond section of the film, which contains zero dialogue but explains the almost ""unexplainable"" in strictly sensory terms, sound and vision, no words!  This is also directly reflected in Kubricks' flash cut edits to Bowmans' blinkingeye, taking in the sensory overload of his amazing journeyand transformation with no speech to interfere with it; how could he possibly speak at this point anyway? Words are inadequate, there was simply no other way to tell the finale of the story. Why have a stupid voiceover narration over the completely ineffable? And that's why 2001 is a masterpiece, but it may take some 50 viewings to figure it all out, and some may never figureit out at all.  But I believe they will be the poorer fornot making the attempt."	5.0	Don't listen to the pseudo-intellectuals commenting on 2001	2005-05-26	11	5	6

REALLY? No one is going to buy a movie that costs 1000 dollors.I understand it now though. The reason this happens is that someone sends an item to be sold through the fulfilment option and then sells there product on the side as well. When you choose fulfilment, you still get to choose the price. And since Amazon doesn't have any of this product in stock, they can't give it a retail price. But since Amazon will use their fulfilment products instead you end up with a price that is at the mercy of the seller. Amazon's price makes it look as if this item is rare and sought after so the consumer will be convinced to purchase one from another seller thinking that they are getting a good deal. But I bet you that those other sellers are in on the fulfilment. It's pretty smart by those who are behind it, but not too smart for me.The only difference in this product from the plastic case version is that it will get scratched easily and costs 20 dollors more than it is worth.	5.0	WARNING!!!!

(Yes you are, or you wouldn't be saying nasty things about this masterpiece. Go back to your copies of Star Wars!) This film is a story about mankinds evolution, purpose, grand destiny, and greatest adventure. It requires the viewer to be 'Ready' for the experience, and is a film where reading the book is sort of recommended for total clarity as the film makes the viewer work for the answers and doesn't just give you all the x-position.(Whence why some people hate this film. Sorry your pathetic brains require everything given to you!)It's technical excution is breath taking, when you consider the age it was made. It is an art, music, and visual feast with some seriously comtemplative moments. No-one ever 'gets' the film first time round so don't worry if your not quite sure what's going on. I suggest reading the book, and then watching the film again after that. The book is amazingly easy to read and thoroughly enthralling, and I'm not a huge book reader.Brilliant acting, exquiste sets, and unmatched photgraphic realism.My only gripe with this superb edition of the DVD is the lack of a commentary or making of. I'd hoped that there would be more on it than just the film, but on the other hand, it is superbly remastered with a striking picture clarity and beautiful sound design.(P.S.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2JBVXCOTDW8XS	Sean Wheeler	There's no question that 2001 is one of the most influential films in history.  And in many mays it deserves its hallowed reputation.  It is one of the few sci-fi films that is filled with genuinely astounding visuals.  It features a great villian in the computer HAL, the only three-dimensional character present in the film.  And the use of classical music instead of a full-blown film score is a stroke of genius.  Can you hear &quot;Thus Spark Zarathustra&quot; without thinking of the Star-Child?  Didn't think so!And yet, I have to admit, watching this movie in its entirety is like watching paint dry.  And, in some cases, I'd prefer the paint.  Kubrick, while a true cinematic giant, spends way too much time focusing on unnecessary details.  For instance, every door knob that Dave opens on the scapeship is shown in full detail.  Why?  I guess to iritate the viewer, since it certainly doesn't advance the plot at all.  And somes parts are just laughibly pretentious.  The apes featured in the first sequence, for example, are distractingly dated. That would be okay if Kubrick didn't present them with such pomp and circumstance.  But because of this, it's hard to take them at all seriously.  Let's not even mention the snail-like pacing.Stanley Kubrick is a genius, but I prefer the Kubrick of &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and &quot;The Shining&quot; to the overblown Kubrick presented here.  That Kubrick was scathingly satirical and and highly entertaining.  This Kubrick is seriously unfunny and way too stone-faced.

But he does it and it's wonderful.  This film is a must for beginning filmmakers to show them how to effectively use visual storytelling.  Kubrick uses a mixture of music, sounds, visuals, and extraordinary composition to portray one of the greatest science fiction films of our time. The film looks at our dependence on the tools we use and the power they have because of this dependence.  Kubrick does this by taking us all the way back to the dawn of man and showing use the first time a tool was used.  We flash ahead several thousands of years to find tools, computers, controlling everything we do.

The experience was typical for ""film,"" the soundtrack was full of pops and hisses and the large screen only accentuated the imperfections of the medium, appearing washed out with lots of scratchiness. Very unlike the Blu-ray version! Nonetheless it was quite an experience and I credit it with being the starting point for a lifetime love of sci-fi. It is about the only sci-fi movie I can think of that has aged like a rare wine, the title (2001) aside. You can see the optimism of the 1960s, when we were well on our way to the moon and presumably beyond, and you can feel the foreboding throughout the film that in spite of that optimism we have bitten off far more than we can chew, as the end of the film attests.The transfer to Blu-ray is spectacular and does not disappoint.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1J1163Q56YIVZ	Shaun Anderson	"Like most successful science-fiction films ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" works best as a purely visual experience. Sci-fi first and foremost is a genre based on spectacle. Director Stanley Kubrick grasped this important concept at a time when sci-fi had largely been dismissed as B movie material. The general failing of sci-fi in the 1950's, was its failure to consistently realise its monsters, alien worlds and futuristic spacecraft. This led naturally to an over-reliance on other genres (most notably the horror film), too much dialogue, and soporific and sickly love stories. To break from this past Kubrick conceived of his sci-fi spectacle as more than anything an exercise in special effects. In its realisation of Outerspace the film has still yet too be matched or bettered. Despite the modern reliance on artificial CGI (which looks obviously fake), the model work of ""2001"" far exceeds anything created in the last decade. By acknowledging first, the visual imperatives of the genre, Kubrick virtually excises all dialogue from his film, all efforts at characterisation (ironically the character with most depth is a computer), and the total removal of irritating distractions such as romance, and polarised depictions of good and evil. If anything ""2001"" is totally devoid of emotion. In many ways Kubrick returns us to the territory of the silent film, a purely imagistic realm. But this is not too dismiss the films complex and impressive sound design.Because Kubrick removes and erodes conventional mainstream narrative strategies the film takes on a meditative and spiritual tone, a sense of epic and infinitesimal grandeur permeates every frame, which was a major influence on amongst others Andrei Tarkovsky. A sense of the sublime is present, language is made redundant in space, the sound of heavy, space helmeted breathing the only reminder that humanity exists at all. Interpretations of the film abound and that is part of its continued relevance and beauty. It neither confirms nor denies the existence of god. However its message on mankind's over-reliance and worship of science and technology is made explicit; it will kill you in the end."	5.0	"""Open the pod bay door Hal"""	2007-03-28	14	12	2

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2B7BUH8834Y6M	"Shelley Gammon ""Geek"""	Kubrick brings Clarke's novel to the screen with an incredible flair. If you've seen &quot;The Shining&quot; or &quot;Eyes Wide Shut,&quot; you're  familiar w/ Kubrick's signature pauses and slide-show segues.  They are  even more pronounced in the long, often slow-paced film... but when things  happen, DON'T BLINK!The long pauses and slow moving scenes exacerbate  the loneliness and emptiness of space. It is essential that this film be  seen from the beginning to the end. Whenever it was on TV, I'd catch a few  minutes of it and almost pass out from the pauses... but that's because I  missed out on so much of the underlying story.  Clark envisioned a  video-telephone with text messages... much like Internet phone today... and  the ship itself is quite an amazing vision to behold.The film ponders  the dawn of mankind, the awareness of self and the evolution of thought  that eventually goes full circle when we willingly abandon our intellect to  the idols of technology we've created.  Astronauts venturing into deep  space on an important mission experience technological set-backs en route  to their destination and the remainder of the film becomes a battle of the  wits between the human crew and the HAL 9000.The HAL 9000 computer  watches the crew sleep, eat and talk... and makes &quot;mental&quot; notes  on who's a threat and the best course of action to take when parts of the  ship mysteriously stop functioning properly. He controls the ships  functions, including life support, and while he may not be as wise as a  human being, his knowledge and break-neck speed of calculating decisions  makes the human crew almost non-essential.A strange rectangular monolith  is never quite explained, which makes it far more compelling and really  makes you think about the film long after it's over. Don't let the slow  pace discourage you from seeing this film. I prefer non-stop action in  films like &quot;The Matrix,&quot; but this film makes all the difference  in how you perceive sci-fi films that came after it. It is a cerebral  experience to be sure.The DVD includes a press conference with author  Arthur C. Clarke which is very enlightening. You get to hear the press ask  questions about the film and the future of technology and space travel...  many of which are science fact and no longer a topic idle fantasy.  You  really grow to appreciate the visionary mind of Clarke married to the  artistic hand of Kubrick.	5.0	visionary and awe-inspiring	2000-07-31	17	15	2

Having not viewed the movie for a number of years, I was struck by how the movie did not seem dated [for the most part] in both its representation of the future and the special effects.  When taken in the context that the movie was produced in the mid-60's, it is an amazing piece of cinema.The only reason I did not give five stars to the Special Edition was the content of the bonus materials.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2JJDFX8VPI1L0	S. J. Grady	"First, a polite message to all those who found 2001 slow or boring. A diet of fast-paced action films does make the leap to meditative and thoughtful a little hard. It's like going from pepsi to pinot noir. But you're missing out if you don't at least try to break the fizzy habit, and this film is the one to break that habit with. It's considered a masterpiece for good reason. Obviously that doesn't mean it will be to everyone's taste, but there are many tastes worth making the effort to acquire (olives and capers for two!).So don't approach 2001 as a popcorn roller-coaster ride. The state you want to be in like that when you stare into a bonfire's flames or watch the waves on a beach. Let this film have an inner dialogue with you. How does it make you feel?Some may try this and still not like the film. But for others I guarantee you it will open this and other ""slow"" films into a cinematic experience that alters your film collection, and maybe your life, forever.*I deliberately haven't described the plot or transfer here, others have done that more than sufficiently."	5.0	Best sci-fi film ever	2010-03-14	11	11	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AROBLPGK3SR5P	S. Loftin	I saw this on sale the other day and decided to get it.  I hadn't seen it in years.  I was probably the first Sci Fi movie I watched back in  the day that wasn't in black and white and had sucky special effects.  The movie still holds up after all these years.  The special effects are still pretty good compared to today's best.The plot line in the movie was always pretty obscure if you hadn't read the book first, and I found myself explaining what was going on to my wife a few times.  You should read the book before or after you see the movie or else wise you might not understand the plot, which is actually pretty interesting. It was a pretty artsy fartsy movie back in the day and that still hasn't changed - how refreshing to hear classical music (Also Sprach Zarathustra and the Blue Danube waltz) in a movie, and not just 5 seconds or so, but the whole song.  It is a lot slower than modern movies in that you will have scenes that last for a minute or two and not cut to another scene frenetically every few seconds.After 40 years or so, some of the things in the movie seem a bit dated, like the computers being IBM rather than Apple or Dell or Microsoft, or AT& T picture phones rather than Skype, but that kind of adds to the charm.  The world was a lot different back then, a lot more hopeful than today, and it is a good snapshot on the way things used to be.  Recommended, and not just for nostalgic baby-boomers!	5.0	2001	2013-02-23	1	1	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AVN00ASBFTMN6	Smoking Ace	2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that goes beyond films. It is a film that takes us to the darkest edges of the universe and shows us places where time and age cease to exist. Descended down from the heavens by some strange alien named Stanley Kubrick, 2001 is a film that is so ambitious and so epic that it remains ahead of its time 42 years after its making.From the beginning of the film at the Dawn of Man there is a unforgettable shot of an otherworldly horizon, and it is our signal that we are no longer in Kansas anymore. Following, is a twenty minute section engaging us in the uneventful lives of our primordial ancestors in a archaic documentary fashion. This segment is an early indication that we are not in the prescence of a director who caters to his audience. Kubrick reminds me alot of the filmmaker Tarkovksy (Solaris, Andrei Rublev), in that he doesn't rush to make scenes unfold quickly nor does he make films that are palatable to every taste. Many people will be put off by this film, calling it boring and dull and yes, the film isn't Star Wars. There are no shootouts, chase scenes or much talking for that matter. But where 2001 lacks in fast paced action, it makes up for in fascinating insights on our place in the universe and in the future.From the Dawn of Man we are shuttled millions of years into the future (following the apes making contact with an ominous black rectangle named The Monolith). The main plot is set in motion as astronaut Dave Bowman is sent on an assignment to Jupiter for research. But unlike most sci-fi pictures the plot is not the most important thing here neither are the actors really. It's what the film says through these aspects that's the star. In the middle of the film Bowman and his shipmates antagonize with the computer system of their ship who has their whole environment in his control. While many would find this predictament to be an interesting premise for a horror film, Kubrick turns it into a cautionary message about our over reliance on technology. HAL is the prototype for the  irony of modern technology: In that technology started out as our servant and has ended up being our mental enslaver.  And that my friends is something that is MORE relavent today then it ever has been.Look at the film on just a technical level, and it's still a masterpiece. Here are some of the most magnificent special effects in the history of cinema and they were done over 40 years ago! None of what today's big-time directors, with their 100 billion dollar budgets, do can come anywhere close to what Kubrick did here. The stargate sequence is still one of the freakiest experiences I've ever had in cinema; Only because I know that the deepest reaches of space probably look somewhat similar to this. The use of editing and jump cuts is still influential today, and at that time had considerable influence on Speilberg and George Lucas. I know its been said a trillion times but the genius of the famous bone/satellite jump cut still makes me awe at Kubrick's creativity.I am not the first to review this film (1,079 reviewers came before me) and I most certainly won't be the last. Here is a film that is so jampacked with the mysteries and themes of our existence that for generations after all of us are gone, people will still be discussing the purpose of the monolith, the stargate, and good ol' HAL. Someone earlier asked what the point of this film is, I don't think there is any simple way to answer that question but if I had to try I would say this: The universe is a mystery filled with  questions that only provide  answers with more questions, and those questions will never be in reach to our small earthling existence. That's what I gather anyway, and for me the mystique of the questions is what makes 2001 all the more exhilirating. 2001: A Space Odyssey is not only a film that deserves to be seen, it deserves to bought, examined, examined and examind again.	5.0	The most thought provoking film ever created.	2011-07-13	6	6	0

The film has always been one of my all time favorites. But know I feel like I never really experienced the movie until now.It's an amazing technical feast that Kubrick has made. What's wonderful about this ""Sci-Fi"" is that it feels so personal like sharing an idea one on one with someone. There's the wonderful story of man and machine from bone to HAL. It's just simply amazing. The atmosphere that Kubrick created is just simply amazing.If you have never seen the movie before give it a rent but watch it alone in a dark room.

He was a liberal free minded). Keep breathing as Dave with the helmet on...facing the fear of the unknown...thrilling!!!!This movie is the bridge to a defiant and odd future. The movie brings us a smashing series of questions that for many centuries the mankind has confronted and not answered yet. I still did not agree with the apes in the opening sequence, or the evolutionary theory either. I grab my interests after the dawn of man, to be more specific in the chapter 24 ""Open the doors"" the battle begins man x machine, and after Hal has been disconnected, Dave in the Pod, starts a journey into the unknown; in the final sequence, when Dave head his finger toward the black monolith (as in the creation of man of Michelangelo's picture in the Sistine Chapel), we understand that God is the answer in the ultimate moment of The Odyssey, or quoting Carl Sagan:"" We are not alone in the Universe and we belong to Someone Greater than ourselves...."" In the moment that the Star child appears Kubrick give us another outlook, now as have been done for all existence, a baby child, a fetus of a man has been conceiving in a human belly; it creates a parallel with the hypothetical beginning with the evolutionary simians; that moment the question isn't anymore: How we came here?, but, Where are we going to? Can we come back from the dead? Moreover, at that point we come back to start of the history, Dave reborn and look to the earth, to the infinite...but his journey is not finished yet, how many years we need to accomplish something? For billions of years the mankind has fought with the dilemma ""We must accept God, or not?"" Kubrick gives us the chance to analyze all the facts and theories using the silence and the spectacular movement of the camera. Speech still is the way of understanding each others point of view and Kubrick give us a silence to think and re-think, to question the ordinary things and the disturbing too. We must check all the things and get the good ones. Reflecting we can solve many problems, and Kubrick leave us something to think of...an intriguing moment in the movie history and a total mystery for mankind, but for how long now?"	5.0	An intriguing moment in the movie history.	2001-06-13	0	0	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3FEQXNCFC68KC	"SRFireside ""ZOOM!"""	This movie was made way back in 1968 and it still blows the doors off of some of the stuff made today. This space opera is teeming with ambience, imagery, intelligence and style. This film is more a work of art than a motion picture.To start off with the special effects were way ahead of its time. No sci-fi made back then could hold a candle to 2001. I still have a hard time believing this was made in the 60's. The use of classical music on the soundtrack only enhances the style. There isn't a lot of dialog, which is great. It gives you time to really soak the imagery in. What few dialog there was only added to the realism. No dry one liners or lame speeches here.The only bad thing I can say about 2001 is it's just too freaking long. That attention to ambience and detail can be a two edged sword. Kubrick spends a lot of time on each scene. I feel a fair amount of scenes take too much time. I think you can probably edit out a good 30 minutes of the flick and you won't miss a thing. I understand what Kubrick was doing making all the scenes that long. It kind of puts you there in real time, but I think it's excessive. Also the ending kinda goes into left field. The entire movie was very scientific and then goes metaphysical at the climax. Some viewers might find the ending a bit confusing. Don't watch it late at night otherwise you might find yourself getting really tired  into the movie.The DVD looks pretty good in my opinion. Then again I never seen the laser disk version so I have no frame of reference on how much better it can be. Still it looks sharp. There is an interesting bonus: a press conference with Arthur C. Clarke. While it's not all that exciting if you see it as a somewhat historical event you get to appreciate this extra. Would have been nice to get a audio commentary by Kubrick.	5.0	Great movie.

In this setting, the film is nothing short of mindblowing, and comes as close as possible to the big screen  effect. Where do I begin in quantifying this film's greatness? It is the  work of a man, Stanley Kubrick, so completely sure of his skills (and  correct in his assessment) that he is totally unconcerned about the glacial  pace of the film, and doesn't do anything to pander to the audience's  shorter attention spans. Yes, it is slow, but  each...unfolding...moment...allows...the...viewer...to really contemplate  what they are seeing, and the effect, combined with the stunning,  impeccably selected classical music, is nothing short of mesmerizing. The  scenes with the prehistoric apes discovering weaponry are amazingly staged.  Yes, it's people in ape suits...but are they? The sequence is completely,  incredibly believable. And then the millions-of-years jump cut...wow. This  is simply one of the most rewarding, sublime, creative, gorgeous  movie-watching experiences in cinematic history, and I really wish I could  give it more than 5 stars. The special effects, for a film 32 years old,  still look fresher than anything CGI geeks could dream up. See this film on  DVD.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AKZ0VCSGG1YIS	"Stanwyck ""Stanwyck"""	"I have read many Amazon reviews and have quickly realized that if you disagree with the mainstream- offering a positive review of an abysmal movie, or a highly critical one of a popular one, you take the risk of inviting all manner of intellectually challenged people to make useless and non-constructive comments.So, if you are so inclined to offer this type of imbecility at the conclusion of this review, have at it. I may be secure in the knowledge that you did not understand my premise.Now, to begin. I understood the movie. My problem is with how it was done. This movie has a tremendously inflated, and largely undeserved, reputation. In 1968, people flocked to view it to see what the future might be. People watch it today to see what people thought the future would be. But what is it really? Mostly, it's talky, boring, and to the uninitiated viewer, needlessly complex and unsatisfying.Amazingly, it consists principally of long stretches where people do virtually nothing. If Dr. Floyd was on a bus, instead of the Pan Am shuttle, you can quickly see what I mean. Would you be interested in watching someone who sleeps, eats, almost loses his pen and tries to figure out how to use the toilet? This is incredible and compelling drama- edge of your seat stuff.But, it gets better. When he arrives at the bus (space) station, he has an extremely exciting conversation with some people in the lounge (where he tells them nothing) and then makes a phone call home. Then he gets on another bus (the moon craft) and finally arrives at his destination. Once there, he conducts a meeting where he finally explains to those in attendance (who ought to know already) the purpose of his trip.On the way out to anamoly, one of the other scientists aboard the moon shuttle informs him that the object appeared to have been ""deliberately buried."" This is no big deal to Floyd. He just chuckles like someone told him that his shoe was untied. When he gets to the site, he apparently can't think of anything better to do than to than have his picture taken with it.Now for the Discovery- another long stretch of heart-pounding action. We see two of the most unexciting astronauts ever known who are almost indistinguishable from their counterparts who are in suspended animation. We see them having boring conversations, eating, drawing pictures and playing chess with the computer, which apparently eventually has enough of them and decides to send them on to the great beyond.Finally- something begins to happen- almost two hours into this thing, but it doesn't last long.This is a visually impressive movie, and the music is great, but when you distill it, there isn't much more there than a half hour twilight zone episode, and I'm sure that Rod Serling could have made it much more interesting."	2.0	A Space marathon!	2010-02-15	24	18	6

The thing is I understood the the movie completely, but I also saw how this movie could have been much, much better. The story of ""2001"" is quite possibly one of the most origional stories ever written (no. 1 would probobly be the Bible). Unfortunatly this is all the movie has going for it. One can make a magnificent, thought provoking movie without making it so horribly boring. the scenes last far to long to keep the audiences attention (well mine). the timing is totally off. a knowledgable director knows that s scene needs to keep going just long enough so the audience can tell what is happening and what the director is trying to say. But ""2001"" is as if Kubric is repeating his adea over and over to me each time i stop and think of how long ive been watching it. after a while i begin to daydream. I've been spoiled with ""The Godfather"", ""Citizen Kane"", and ""The Shawshank Redemption"", where even weeks after i see it i am still thinking back to it's genious and it's power and could possibly watch those films over an over again for a long time. If Kubric could have done it right it would be widely accepted as cinematic genious, (not just by ""think-they know-it-all"" critics and others who are easily pleased) but bottom line it's slow, nonsencical, and boring."	1.0	Dull and uniteresting	2002-11-23	46	13	33

DON'T watch this film with this pre-programmed expectation.Instead, think of this film as animated art, like if you were at a musuem appreciating sculptures or paintings. This film is like Fantasia, only not a cartoon, and with a deep symbolic meaning.Kubrick is using this film to ask us to ponder, who we are, as a people, and where are we going? This film is about the evolution of man...our ability, as a species to have courage, to reason and to innovate, and what that means in a much broader picture -- not in the context of our planet, but in a context of being part of an entire universe.I hated this film the first time I saw it. The second, I fell in love with the cinematography. The third, I did research and began to understand the symbolic meaning. By the fourth time, I realized that this indeed was a masterpiece. But, I am a huge cinema buff, and have the time to see such films over and over again.The average movie-goer may not, and probably should take a pass.	4.0	Most hate this at first, but those who ponder might see the light	2006-03-13	11	10	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2VP7JOT3K7PFM	"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie"""	"+++++This 1968 movie that was produced and directed by the late Stanley Kubrick has four parts: (1) The Dawn of Man: one scene (2) From the Earth to the Moon: eight scenes (3) The Jupiter Mission: fifteen scenes (4) Jupiter...and Beyond the Infinite: four scenes.  (Note that this movie is two and a half hours long but if you take out the beginning overture, opening credits, intermission, and end credits, it is about two hours long.)The Dawn of Man is concerned with our prehistoric ape-ancestry past.  Here we get a glimpse of how our ape-ancestors gradually adapted to their environment.  Also, near the end of this scene, we first see the black monolith (a large slab) that looks strangely out of place in this prehistoric landscape.Then the movie leaps millennia (by way of one of the most enthralling film cuts ever imagined) into man's techno-future.  A monolith has been discovered on the Moon.  As a result, a scientist from Earth has to go to the Moon via space shuttle to investigate.  The flight from the Earth to the Moon has become routine.  We see how man again has adapted to his environment so as to make such a flight routine.  As an example of this adaptation, be sure to look for the special zero-gravity toilet that passengers have to use.As a result of this investigation, there is a mission to Jupiter.  It is in this part that we finally meet the main characters of the movie: astronaut Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea), astronaut Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), and the supercomputer named HAL (that has the voice of Doug Rain) that controls all the functions of the Jupiter-bound spaceship.  Suspense is created when HAL starts acting up making Dave and Frank realize that they are in a real dangerous situation.I have two favorite scenes in this part.  First, the two astronauts isolate themselves from HAL so they can discuss the situation.  The shot of HAL ""eavesdropping"" on their conversation is unforgettable.  Second, the image of HAL being shut down and pleading for his ""life"" and singing ""Daisy"" is incredible.  You'll also note that throughout the scenes with HAL that it is this talking supercomputer that ironically has the dialogue with the most feeling.The fourth and last part is the most mystical, metaphysical, and mysterious part of the movie.  The spaceship with now only Dave alive enters a star gate and travels through space and time via a wormhole to another dimension.  It is at the end of the wormhole that Dave encounters a monolith and sees his own death and rebirth as a child of the stars.This movie has hardly any dialogue and the little that does exist is secondary to the stunning visual effects and the blending of music and motion.  It's fascinating to compare the Jupiter sequences in the movie with the actual color footage taken years later by the Voyager space probes.  The music by Khachaturian, Ligeti, Johann Strauss (""The Blue Danube""), and Richard Strauss (""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" -- first heard in the opening credits) adds immeasurably to the greatness and awe of this movie.What I did was watch the movie first, then I read the book which has the movie's title (and was written by Sir Arthur C. Clarke), then I watched the movie again.  I must confess that I could not understand a lot of this movie on first viewing.  It was only after reading the book (in which there are many similarities but also major differences with the movie) and then re-watching the movie that I fully understood all that was going on (and thus what enabled me to write the above synopsis).  This is because the movie does not explain details but the book does.Finally, I should explain my rating.  On first viewing the movie, I would give it three stars.  I think Kubrick expected too much from viewers when he thought that they could somehow ""figure out"" all the important details of this movie.  (In fact, when this movie was first previewed in 1968, a then famous actor walked out saying ""Will someone tell me what the hell this [movie] is about?"")  Only after reading the book and then watching the movie again would I give it easily five stars.  The average of the above ratings is four stars.THREE-STEP RECOMMENDATION:(1) Watch the movie (to experience the mystery and awe of it and ignore details).(2) Read the book (to understand finer details).(3) Watch the movie again (to experience the magnificence of this movie with greater insight).+++++"	4.0	Open the Doors of Your Mind and Journey Beyond the Infinite!	2004-03-08	11	5	6
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A30YERKMFVW418	"Stephen R. Spurgin ""Fair Price Advocate"""	Watching this film again shows the optimism and can do spirit of the 60's however impossible that optimism was.  In retrospect,the film never takes into account the costs, limits of technology, space time in general, or any idea of how we got all that hardware into space in only 33 years?  To think in 1968 we would be advanced enough only three decades later, to take mankind to, hello, Jupiter?  Neil Armstrong's Apollo 11, &#34;That's one small step&#34; was still a year away.  What makes this film unforgettable is the fiction of Arthur C. Clarke, and the brilliant imagery from the very strange but fertile mind of Stanley Kubrick.  I well remember when this film was released.  No one quite knew what to make of the film.  What the h*** is this movie about?  Uh?  I remember being told that everyone should experience 2001... while under the influence of LSD.  The films' use of psycedelic imagery played directly to the flower power youth of the era.  As a relic of 60's sci-fi, the film captures two moments in time.  That moment when we really knew nothing, to the moment we actually thought we knew it all.  Actual manned missions to Mars or anywhere else is but folly. Also true, is this film did pave the way for all that followed.  Without this important movie, sci-fi films would have never looked the same.  The best cinematic parts and issues of this film are still on display in dozens of &#34;space&#34; movies made in the last 45 years.  Imitation is the highest of complements.  Going on 50, the film looks fairly good in Blu-ray. Watch it again for the first time.	4.0	All Spaced Out Again	2014-07-02	0	0	0

That didn't matter, as speculating about the meaning with other 2001-ophiles  kept me enthralled for hours. The years have not diminished my admiration  for the masterpiece that Kubrick produced. Nothing I have seen since comes  close to replicating the realism of the sets or the science they were  attempting to illustrate (when was the last time you didn't hear wild  noises from a passing spaceship?). I had been very apprehensiive after  placing my order for the DVD and only then reading the negative reviews  that the quality of the transfer to DVD was poor. Fortunately my worst  fears were unrealised as I found both picture and sound quality to be  excellent. 2001 is still one of the great experiences of cinema!

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AC3Y48EM9SM6K	stephen walker	this is definitely one of the best movies of all time. It was not a movie that was made a novelty to those living in the 60's,knowing Kubrick's work, that is a fact. It is a smart film, probably more intelligent than the book itself. And besides, it is dazzling us today...the 70mm print on the widescreen makes your knees shake. I first saw this movie when i was 12 on thanksgiving day on HBO, and I didn't know what to expect. When I was 6, I watched the begginning because i heard there were monkeys in it. I stopped whatching as soon as the Blue Danube kicked in. But this was the first time I saw it the whole way through, and the first time had me captured in the movie. I will admit that Stanley may have been a little crazy about this movie, and you can laugh at parts that you're not supossed to laugh  at, but thats not because its bad, its because Kubrick's vision was so odd. Ill stop now annd just say that this movie's ending might dissapoint, but just know thatit isnt suppossed to be explicit.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	This disc shows off an excellent video transfer as well. No grain that I could detect , nor artifacting and aliasing. It is clear to me that they put some time in remastering the video before the reformat to Blu Ray.The audio ( PCM  lossless 5.1) is left in the corner with almost no use whatsoever of the surround channels or LFE channel. The wonderfully classic soundtrack is evenly spread across your front channels with good separation but the LFE and discreet channels are left by the wayside. Remember to go to the menu as it defaults to DD 5.1 compressed. While this film was groundbreaking in its time and many went to see it stoned out of their gourd in '69, I don't feel as if the film holds up. It did feel dated to me. No hate mail please.2001; A Space Odyssey comes with plenty of supplementary extras and a large variety of language choices. The extras, I found to be worthwhile and interesting..most dated at 2007. Thankfully, there were no advertisement trailers .All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks	3.0	2001: A Space Odyssey	2012-12-13	1	1	0

Visually, this is one of the most impressive films ever made. The story is told through images and music, rather than dialogue -- well, there is dialogue here, except that the film is 2 hours and 19 minutes long, with about 40 minutes worth of dialogue. To some, it may sound tedious, but for those of us who are willing to try something a bit different, it is a treat. A truly haunting film, indeed. Kubrick is a genius! I have yet to be utterly disappointed by one of his films. That is rare, for a director to have made eight flawless films in his lifetime. See this one. It is definitely worth every minute.	5.0	Beautiful!	2008-05-15	7	6	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2RHQMV5GD18Z8	Steven Aldersley	2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)Science Fiction, 141 minutesDirected by Stanley KubrickStarring Keir Dullea and Gary LockwoodStanley Kubrick certainly didn't restrict himself to one particular genre. In one of his most ambitious films, he took us into space. Up until that point, science fiction was often thought of as amusing and many early movies were laughably bad. Kubrick changed that perception at a stroke with the release of 2001.The film isn't easy to watch. The opening sequence attempts to show how humans descended from apes and learned how to use tools and weapons. Special effects in 1968 were not advanced and so Kubrick simply dressed actors in ape costumes. This long sequence is told without the use of dialogue and will alienate a lot of viewers.After one of my favorite cuts in movie history, in which a spinning bone transitions into an orbiting spaceship, we are taken into space. The story involves the discovery of monoliths. The apes find the first one and learn how to use tools. The second is buried on the moon and the third orbits Jupiter. Each monolith marks an advancement in the human race and alerts an alien race to our progress.Kubrick got a lot of things right, portraying weightlessness and the lack of sound in space. He used classical music throughout the story and saw spaceships docking as a kind of dance. One of his most complex characters was a machine.This isn't a film I would recommend to everyone. It's suitable for those who like to reflect on what they have just seen. It stands up to repeat viewings and analysis and sparks the imagination, but some viewers will give up very early. The first three minutes appears to be a black screen with background music (it's more than that). The evolution of the apes consists of a lot of shouting and jumping around. It took me several attempts before I fully understood Kubrick's vision and started to make sense of the story. I now regard it as one of the best science fiction movies ever made.	5.0	Slow and difficult, but ultimately worth the effort	2012-02-29	1	1	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AQQLWCMRNDFGI	Steven A. Peterson	"Perhaps one of the most telling comments one could make about this movie is that it has held up very well over time. The movie came out about thirty years ago.  Its special effects were considered ""state of the art"" then.  Today, with much more sophisticated tools, special effects have come light years from the later 1960s.  Nonetheless, 2001 still has visual credibility.The movie began with a story by science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke.  Then, the two collaborated on the movie. The movie itself has several parts, not necessarily melded together seamlessly.  But the effects of the movie are such that it hardly seems to matter.In the beginning. . . .  The first part of the movie features pre-human apes, trying to survive under rather grim circumstances. While Kubrick did not ""get it right"" as to how such apes would have lived, the opening is powerful. The movie begins by following one group. A monolith appears, something strange happens, and this group becomes something special. Whereas earlier it was put upon by other fellow apes, AM (after the monolith) they became more dominant.  One of the great scenes in movie history ends this segment: an ape throws a bone-weapon into the air and it is magically transformed into a space vessel far into the future, to the year 2001.Part II features a trip to the moon as scientists and others try to determine what a strange form there signifies.  That form is a monolith (perhaps the spine of this movie is the monolith).  An uncomfortable ending to this part. . . .Then the space flight, with the computer, HAL, as a key player. Things go very wrong, Bowman fights a desperate fight, and then we move to the next part.Bowman travels somewhere sometime and ends up in an apartment, aging.Then, the mysterious ending, with Bowman having been transformed into what?  The book's ending makes an attempt to explain; Kubrick's movie does not.  And perhaps the movie works the better for it.All in all, a genuine classic.  One of the best science fiction movies of all time, and one of the best period.  There are issues with the movie: inaccuracies in our pre-hominid ancestors'' portrayal, parts that may not fit together, occurrences that are never explained.  But the whole is more than the sum of its parts.  A movie made long ago that still holds up well."	5.0	An all-time classic	2007-12-22	2	2	0

Then a year or so later saw it in a theater that was meant to show this movie (in Walnut CA).  It was an experience in the best sense of the word.  I don't remember how many times I saw it there (the theater only showed 3 movies in the 7 months I was in the area and 2001 ran for 5 months of that time - all tickets were pre-sold too).  The movie is still a tour-d-force on the large screen TV I have, but it does not provide the ""Experience"" that I received in the Walnut theater.  I suspect that if you have never viewed this on the screen (with appropriate sound system) it was made for, that it will seem a disappointment.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2JS2OU5SBH1XQ	Studebaker Hoch, billythemtn@geocities.com	Oh, the sheer genius of The Man!  Leave it to Kubrick to redefine not only the medium of film, but the genre of science fiction as well.  This is, without doubt, the greatest science fiction film, as well as one of the  greatest films (regardless of genre), ever made.  The grandeur and scope of  this film are incredible!  I'm at a loss for words, actually.  Perhaps this  is appropriate, for how does one describe what is essentially a non-verbal,  visceral experience?  2001 is a mythopoeic exploration of human evolution,  from the birth of man's sentience to his redefinition of time and space.  It is a religious film for aethists in the technological age.  The film  glories in the wonders of the Newtonian/Cartesian universe man has  fashioned for himself (eg the spaceship ballet to the elegant waltz of  Strauss; the pristine, deathly beauty of the Discovery), while at the same  time agitating for expansion beyond those boundries of linear logic (eg  Bowman's journey and his subsequent evolution into the &quot;Star  Child&quot;).  This is also a warning that humans are stagnating, that we  are failing to continue to grow and evolve (why do think Heywood Floyd is  such a boring bureaucrat when confronted with the most momentous find in  history?), becoming complacent with our tools (this is why the bone thrown  by the protohuman jump cuts into a space ship; the ship is no more than a  high tech &quot;bone/tool&quot;).  It is an examination as to human  identity as well, what makes us human (ie sentient?)  For surely HAL has  intelligence, self awareness, even emotions.  And the Monolith, that  towering symbol of aliens, the unknown, the abstract, universal forces, the  tao, the unknowable, God even??  And if Kubrick seems to tell us little,  it's because that fits in with the thematics of the story: we, as viewers,  are becoming too complacent (like Floyd) with the well defined cinematic  narrative (and by extension, any knowledge that is spoon fed to us, which  is, essentially, our universe now), our own &quot;bone/tool&quot; perhaps,  and failing to grow and expand.  This film is supposed to make you THINK  FOR YOURSELF.  There need not be concrete, scientific explanations for all  that occurs, we must break free of our own linear, confined logic and  become Star Children like Bowman.  2001, the film, is the audience's  Monolith.  I would recommend not reading the accompanying novel (I know, I  know, I can hear the boo's and hisses already), but Clarke and Kubrick have  very different worldviews, and the film and the book reflect this.  I  believe that much of the film's mythological elements are lost to the book  in its straight forward, far too explanatory nature (and if any of you  doubt that the film has such elements, well Stan the Man has said it  himself: he called 2001 a &quot;mythological documentary&quot; and said  that MGM bankrolled a $50 million &quot;religious film&quot;.  Further, he  has refused to discuss its thematics.  Why?  He wants us to THINK FOR  OURSELVES).  So now you know.

The roots of man are being planted! How deep and symbolic!!"" is about the extent of the action for the first 30 minutes or so) and lots of pretentious digressions - for example, the ""mysterious"" (read: meaningless) black inanimate alien which emanates artsy choir music. The use of music in other parts of the film is original and sometimes beautiful, but that alone does not justify paying for a DVD copy.Anyone who hasn't seen this film needs to bear in mind that whole 10 minute sections are devoted to people walking (very slowly) around a spaceship, monkeys fighting, spaceships spinning around in space, etc etc.I recommend this film to the following: people who are terminally stoned, terminally pretentious or terminally comatose.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2A8PN3Q5QVNR6	Suzanne	"""You are free to speculate, as you wish, about the philosophical and allegorical meanings of 2001.""- Stanley KubrickWhat should film be? What should a good film accomplish? Kubrick challenged our very notion of those concepts in 1968 with perhaps the most brilliant piece of artistic science fiction ever created. 40 years later it's easy to see the polarizing nature of this film. The problem is one of pre-conceived notions about film's purpose. When artists push the envelope of what can be done in their genre, they're almost always met with resistance from the conservative old-school and cries of ""genius!"" from the forward thinkers. (Look at Stravinsky's Rite of Spring for an example in a completely unrelated genre.)What makes film unique in the world of art? The ability to tell stories with a rich narrative can be done (better) in literature. The ability to evoke emotions and abstract thoughts can be done (better) by visual arts and music. Film's unique contribution is that of moving pictures. If a picture can say 1000 words, what can a 2 1/2 hour long moving one do? In a way, the ""picture is worth"" theory is representative of how futile words can be as a means of expression (no offense intended to the great authors and poets). Great films are those that can say something significant, from beginning to end using visuals. Music, sound, and dialogue should only exist to enhance and illuminate the visuals, not overpower and drive them.Kubrick takes the idea of using moving pictures to state an idea to the extreme. He strips away narrative conventions and uses incredibly dense imagery, meticulously crafted scenes, an immense amount of abstract symbolism and allegory, and only a classical music soundtrack for guidance. Then he allows it all to speak by and for themselves. In a 2.5 hour film there's around 40 minutes of dialogue. That means about 75% or 3/4 of the film is told through its visuals alone. He crafts 3 ""acts"" (some argue 4) that reiterates a story in an increasingly visual and abstract manner, where every scene says something both singular while enhancing the big picture.It's fair to say this film has almost no plot. If there is one, it centers around men in the future who are sent on a mission to investigate a strange monolith that is the first evidence of an extra-terrestrial, sentient life form. Is it boring? For those with short attention spans, a need to be spoon-fed an ""entertaining story"", and be lead by the hand at every step, then yes: by those standards, it is. For those with patience, good attention spans, and receptive minds, then no, it's not. Ultimately, 'boring' is relative. To really ""get"" 2001, one must be in a calm, meditative, ""centered"" state where you can receive and process information, without needing it handed to you. While most films put the puzzle together for you, Kubrick merely provided the pieces and leaves it to his audience to do the rest.One enlightening critique from Nathan493 (IMDb) compares 2001 to Eastern and Western art techniques: ""Western technique dictates a canvas to be completely filled with little or no untouched space left, while eastern art there is a strong tendency to leave large stretches of canvas blank, so that the void speaks as loudly to the observer as the subject matter. This is where 2001 is its strongest, the ""boring"" or ""void"" areas of the film are often as strong visually as the busy and ""filled in"" facets of the movie.""Kubrick indeed uses long stretches of ""void"" to allow the viewer to meditate on all that's being said. Without this void, a complex film would've likely turned into an incomprehensible mess. The extreme amount of time that Kubrick allows us to breath and analyze the scenes are a very large part of WHY this film works at all.2001 is almost an entirely intellectual film. Art works on two obvious levels: the emotional (through which we connect and feel the implied emotions of a work) and the intellectual (through which we recognize and analyze the intentionally created work). Most want films that move them, not challenge them intellectually, but 2001 does just that. There will always be those who ""don't get it"" because they watch it with preconceived notions about what film as an artistic medium should be. For those who don't hold these notions, or are willing to let them go, 2001 is a monolithic epochal work of one's artistic vision about man's existence that was aeons ahead of its time.For those who ""don't get it"", don't worry. There's more films made for you than there are for us, which is a personal lament and not an insult. ""Masterpiece"" has largely become trite, but I have to think the word was coined for works like this. For me, 2001 is a profound odyssey of the mind. It speaks volumes on where we've been, and where we might be going, and all the perils that will plague us along the way. It continually challenges the viewer to transcend complacency and evolve into something greater. It touches on almost every major element that pertains to humanity and existence. All the while being the best trip one could ever take while sober."	5.0	When Words Fail...	2007-07-14	5	5	0

This is one case where the film is definitely better than the book and better without it. Too many people look to the book to ""fill in the gaps"" of the film or to ""explain"" it. But kubrick's genius is to let the poetry of the film stand on its own. Clarke manages to sap all the poetry and mythic power of the film, by literalizing the whole event. Just watch this great work of art with an open mind and a few friends, then spend an evening discussing it and a lifetime reflecting on it.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3VOH5MH8J7Z72	"Tacoloft ""Tacoloft"""	"OK, I have lived in a cave.  I thought I had viewed 2001: A Space Odyssey before but after I received the Blu-ray movie in the mail and put it into my PS3 to watch it I was like a 17 year old getting ""lucky"" for the first time.  A virgin viewer to this more mature and experienced opus and realizing I had been dating the ""butter-face"" younger girl ala 2010, I finally had my visual-auditory cherry popped.The film and music are legendary.  The movie takes its time in telling a story- mainly visually and musically with minimal dialogue and this is the main deterrent as to why people do not like it.  In my opinion the movies goal is to force the viewer to ask questions about our existence and intelligence in general.  What is intelligence?  Is intelligence a precursor to evolution or the other way around?  Ect... I could go on and on...  This movie cannot force the viewer to ask these questions unless it has open possibilities and unresolved arcs.  This to me is the very strength of the movie.To the point of my review:  Those who like the typical Hollywood blockbuster with all questions answered and wrapped up in a pretty present may not like this movie.  Those who don't mind pondering the unanswered should seriously take a gander.As the credits rolled I realized how nave I was-- in my mind I was fighting the obvious--Lucas stole almost 90% of the visual trickery that all of the people involved in 2001: A Space Odyssey gave birth to.Kubrick's 2001 aimed really close to realism with deeper meaning.  The only thing Lucas did different from Kubrick was borrow (Kubrick's) ideas and give the public a fantasy movie and what they wanted - a story tied up with a pretty bow.Also- side note from IMDB: Much like The Wizard of Oz (1939) and ""Dark Side of the Moon"", it is said that the Pink Floyd song ""Echoes"" from the album ""Meddle"" can be perfectly synchronized with the ""Jupiter & Beyond the Infinite"" segment of the film."	5.0	I thought Lucas was the first to do a lot of things--seems I was wrong.	2008-08-04	4	2	2

I remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1968 at a new, state of the art theater. I remember discussing it with my peers for days on end. By today's standards (2014) it does not pop, move or thrill, it does not frighten, terrorize or slash, it does not have the glitz, glamour or eye candy, it does not have the vulgarity, vanity or eroticism of so many of the films being made today. It captures our imagination and attention with sounds, silence, and subtle images, as well as the soft spoken and unspoken word. 2001 was unique in it's day as well. Both Kubrick and Clarke had a vision based on Clarke's earlier works (much out there about this no need to discuss that here). It is a timeless piece with more dialogue behind the dialogue, scenes behind the scenes and more revelation behind what is revealed. The film and book offers an alternative to creationism while animating the circuits of a digital machine to show us what could be, what human inspired &#34;creation&#34; is capable of being vs external, non-human inspiration ... and the dangers of human &#34;creation&#34;. 2001 is a thought provoking film simple as that and still holds it's own today.	5.0	Thought provoking	2014-04-14	1	1	0

No. But when people ask me what is your all time favorite film...it is Kubrik's space odyssey that springs to mind.  The film's message is so universal and powerfull that it will always resonate, regardless of times and current events.  In this age of &quot;primitive tribal warfare&quot; masquerading as &quot;nationalism with high tech weapons&quot;, the openning ape-man sequence seems so poignant. One may argue that Kubrik's film is too optimistic about the human condition, but maybe not.In any case, this DVD captures all the special effects glory the director managed to acheive without the aid of computers.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	AX3CGM849AWQ1	Teegee	"Film buffs frequently create lists of their 10 favorite movies. My answer changes from day to day, but there are three films always on the list: 2001: A Space Odyssey, Fantasia, and Koyannisqatsi. A science-fiction drama, a cartoon and a new age documentary; three completely different films.2001 is an imaginative look at how man's evolution might have been affected by outside influences. Much of the film has no dialogue whatever. The rest has occasional patches of dialogue, with most having nothing to do with the plot. There is the TV interview, a father's phone call on his daughter's birthday, proud parents radio message on their distant son's birthday, a computer's seeming random questions while working up the crew psychology report, the rambling song of a computer having its memory erased. None of this has anything to do with the search for the source of the strange artifact first found by prehistoric apes, then later by explorers on the moon and how it may affect man's future. More important than dialogue are the amazing visuals and music. The spaceship ballets, technical hardware, and the ending star gate dance of lights, combined with magnificent music evoke the sense of wonder and awe that the vastness of space and the possibilities of the future should inspire.Walt Disney's Fantasia is a groundbreaking film creating a painted ballet to accompany several pieces of well-known music. The only dialogue is short introductions to each piece by renowned musicologist Deems Taylor. He briefly comments on the composer, if the music tells a specific story, and whether Disney's animation follows that story. Music can evoke strong emotions in the listener with or without a story. Fantasia frequently creates new stories for the music, but the power of the music to arouse the listener remains. The mouse king is gone from the Nutcracker Suite, but a circle of dancing mushrooms, and bouquet of waltzing flowers is no less charming and whimsical. The primitive dances of the Rite of Spring have been changed to the struggles of prehistoric life, but the music is still powerfully thrilling. The rage and fury of demons in Night on Bald Mountain end at dawn as the serene beauty of Ave Maria accompanies the glory of a sunrise. Image and music again stir the viewer's soul.Koyannisqatsi is the newest and least known of these three films. It is a 1982 documentary with ads that said ""Until now, you've never really seen the world you live in."". Director Godfrey Reggio combines stock footage (rocket launches, landscape vistas, building demolitions, munitions tests) with spectacular new footage by cinematographer Ron Fricke (cityscapes, commuter crowds, clouds and waves, traffic jams, assembly lines). He creates a mosaic of life in the modern industrial world and how it has become disconnected from the natural world and is now a `life out of balance', which is a translation of the title. Although the film has no characters, dialogue or narration, the dramatic editing and stirring score by Philip Glass create a great emotional, and even physical impact. I once talked my mother into seeing it with me. While she liked it very much and still comments on it, at the end of one particularly frenetic sequence she said, with a sigh of relief, ""Thank goodness that's over"".A science-fiction drama, a cartoon, and a new age documentary; three completely different films thematically that each show the power of image and music to reach the viewer emotionally."	5.0	One of My Favorite Films	2008-09-09	4	0	4

Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke take the viewer on a phantasmagoria of a ride where no man has gone before - or  since.Everyone knows the story: a black, perfectly rectangular, monolith  has been found on the moon.  When it is unmooned (!?) it sends out a signal  to the planet Pluto (Neptune?).  Off go our intrepid astronauts,  accompanied by the only &quot;apparently&quot; human character aboard the  ship -  the HAL 9000 computer.The sets aboard the varied number of  vessels still look modern to my eyes, even after 30 years. Kubricks use of  primary colors and basic geometric shapes for most of the displays, with  either white or black backgrounds was perfect. Only those scenes that  manifest a change in fashion stand out as somewhat outdated.I am not  completely satisfied with the transfer to DVD, there are areas on the  screen where the viewer can see individual pixels, a lot of individual  pixels - this is not good!This is a seminal work in movie history, as  such I recommend the following to bring this DVD up to the level this  cinematic piece requires and deserves: 1) The sound track should be redone  to take advantage of modern recording techniques and digital technology. 2)  The image should be painstakingly remastered using the best available  techniques to insure that the quality of the picture is above reproach. 3)  The original commissioned music score should be provided so that the viewer  can hear how it enhances the movie, or not. 4) The entire undertaking  should be certified using the fabulous THX specifications.This movie  deserves only the best!!!	3.0	A seminal work in the genre!!	1999-03-21	0	0	0

Not since the movie Toys have I seen such wonderful use of color and set design in a movie.It's much more like an art film than Toys though.  We see long and very quiet scenes, screen shots of random colors flying by, close-ups of eyes, a character walking around a strange room in solitude, and Toys doesn't have any of that.But 2001 isn't completely an art film either, because the scenes are loosely connected together to form some form of plot and the budget to produce the film was obviously quite high.  So 2001 is more or less a hybrid between traditinal cinema and independent art films.  And you know something?  I think it works.  For the first viewing at least.If you want to watch it again, I recommend using the scene selection screen to skip the longer build up parts and go straight to the good stuff, like the especially creepy monolith scenes.  They seemed very religious to me.	5.0	I Love the Monolith	2009-09-27	7	3	4

There's not really a plot, per se, and the characters are not there to amuse you.  This is art.  Anyone who doesn't ""get it"" (as I didn't when I first watched it) needs to read the book first.  In fact, reading the book is probably manditory.  It's not one of Clarke's better books (in fact, I think it's one of his worst and I've read almost all of them), but it will let you in on what is happening (though the book differs from the movie on some parts).  I also strongly recommend a chemical enhancement of some sort, perhaps an herbal remedy or something, though you didn't hear that from me.As for those who complain about the lack of plot or interesting characters, please stop embarrassing yourself.  That's like complaining about Mozart's music for the lack of electric guitar.  The character's are intended to be boring, lifeless, and mechanical.  That's the point.  This isn't entertainment.  This is art, and is movie-making at it's finest.  And I find it very interesting and enlightening, especially if you have the proper enhancement.

Also, how can a movie be deep when nothing happens?A note to those who think I just didn't get it: Your absolutely right, I don't.  But although I thought it a waste of my life, I can see how some people managed to enjoy it (so don't whine contantly when people call it terrible).""Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar"" author unknown and my response to the symbolism."	1.0	Lacking what I call a plot	2006-01-22	40	8	32
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2FU2OAAMOXDVZ	"The Dishwasher ""*Not an actual dishwasher"""	"For starters, I guess I'm similar in some ways to the ""ADHD, new-age adolescents"" that so many of you reviewers describe. I'm 21, I actually DO have ADHD, and my favorite genre is the comedy. And as a writer, that's basically all I write: deliberately cheesy comedies.But contrary to what is implied by so many of you, I am totally and completely capable of understanding and appreciating a good, deep film or book. I'm a big fan of A Clockwork Orange (not for the shock value, but for the way it made me examine my views on crime and punishment), as well as other, non-Kubrick films such as Mulholland Dr., The Aviator, Unbreakable, etc. And I'm a big fan of the book 1984.But I can't stand this film, and I'm sick of hearing everybody rave about it, so I feel compelled to protest. It was beautiful when the ape learned how to kill, and the part at the end where the astronaut sees himself go through all stages of life was mesmerizing. But... that was about it. Yeah, I'll admit it: I was bored! Very, very bored. Sure, everything LOOKED very beautiful, but so what? Where's the plot? Where's the underlying message? I keep hearing everybody talk about the ""significance,"" but nobody seems to actually know what that ""significance"" is. (And bear in mind that I'm referring to the meaning of the film, not the technological breakthroughs.)Even Stanley Kubrick himself basically said that the film is meaningless. He said that the meaning of it is ""up to the viewers,"" which is the artistic way of saying, ""I made a purely experimental film with absolutely no story line, and in order to pass it off as a work of genius, I'm going to pretend that it has some subtle, underlying meaning that even I can't specifically identify."" Which I'm not blaming him for; that's a really smart way to market a film. But I'm not buying it.This is the kind of film that you're expected to like because it's an ""intellectual film,"" and if it just so happens that you DON'T like it, then you must be some kind of idiot or ignoramus. So, naturally, most people ""like"" it. And I'll admit that I'm tempted to say that I like it as well, just to look good. But I'm going to be like the kid in the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" fable and point out that, obviously, the king isn't wearing anything.I'm giving it two stars because, in some ways, this film WAS revolutionary. It experimented in portraying things solely with pictures, and it helped pioneer new special effects, among other things. But THAT IS IT. This is the kind of movie you watch once, then wonder why you couldn't have found a better means of killing 2.5 hours, and then avoid seeing ever again at all costs. Sorry guys, but I'm calling BS on this movie..."	2.0	Emperor's New Clothes	2008-07-17	31	3	28

I remembered that while watching 2001 this morning on Turner Classic Movies.In the late 1970's, just before it aired on TV for the first time, I caught a reissue of it in a theatre to see it on the big screen.  Even with STAR WARS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND playing in other theatres, I found 2001 visually spectacular as well as intriguing, mysterious, and challenging.  And it still is.The generation of today has been raised on video games and the best special effects in history--as well as the short-attention-span MTV-editing and simplistic Hollywood story-by-committee mindset--so I would hope that new viewers would watch old films and, somehow, understand what made these films so great ""back in the day.""And what still makes them great."	5.0	1968's Space Odyssey	2005-05-14	0	0	0

Today we see all these stupid sci fi &quot;thrillers&quot;  with the cheesiest dialogue one might ever possibly hear; but this! Kubrick  held back on dialogue probably to allow the viewer to take everything in,  all the sights and sounds, and emotions.

I do enjoy Stanley Kubrick a great deal, Dr Strangelove, The Shining, Clockwork Orange, Eyes Wide Shut, all great movies. But this movie is called a ""Space Odyssey"", it was an odyssey I stayed awake while I watched it, or didn't kill myself.  I already know that I am going to be abased by ""film buffs/experts in film history"" about my review of ""this fine cinematic masterpiece"".  Consequently, whenever someone states they are an ""expert in film history/film buff"" it is just euphuism for ""my opinion is better than yours and you don't know any better.""  Now we have a two disc edition, as if the movie by itself isn't long enough, we now have all extras. I think I have discovered a way to reduce crime in the world, show the violators of law the two disc special edition of ""2001: Space Odyssey"".  I bet within three months there will be less crime.There are some positive aspects of this movie, honestly.  The cinematography in this film was wonderful, the music was amazing, the special effects were great (for 1968), but come on the story was very weak. I mean I did get the point about man, where he was, where he has been and where he is going, and all that fun stuff. However, did there really need to be ten and fifteen minute gaps with no dialogue!! Rather there would just be this classical music played at these silly points that never really seem to fit.  ""Look Sally it is a pen floating in the air!""  There was not a single word spoken the first twenty-five minutes of the movie, just cheesy primates!!!  ""Are they monkeys or are they people dressed in really bad monkey costumes?"" This movie could have had the same effect in an hour less, even ninety minutes less.The characters were pointless and shallow.  I think a great word here to use kids is moot. Then there is the super computer Hal 9000. I just love Hal 9000 ""Dave, Dave"". Drop a rock on my skull. The movie needed to focus on one aspect and stick with it. Too much trying to be ""artistic"" that it missed whatever point it was trying to make.  I also loved the big black ""surf board"" that was the link to our past, present and future.  I thought that was the economy that did that.If you try and tell someone this movie was poor in quality they get bent out of shape. If someone tells you they like this movie I can accept that...maybe....not likely..., but if they tell you they enjoyed it because they feel the power of the film, then they are full of #@*! It is almost like people hear that ""2001: Space Odyssey"" is a great movie and therefore when they watch it they must conform or they'll be gunned down.  Citizen Kane is another movie that shouldn't be accosted or the result is heresy.  I will give you the 4-1-1, Citizen Kane sucked too!When witnessing ""2001: Space Odyssey"", I felt like I was watching a two hour and thirty minute screensaver, after it goes for a bit the computer turns off. Sort of like my mind watching this tomfoolery disguised as marvelous motion picture. I think it would be fun to play a drinking game (alcohol will be needed) while watching this movie. The game is this; only put your mixed drink/beer/straight liquor down when there is a scene with dialogue. Unless a person has a stomach of steel and strong endurance, they will be trashed within the first fifteen minutes of regulation. As a matter of fact, I am pretty sure your sofa will look a lot like a space station and your living room another planet by the time you are done watching 2001 and playing this game.In all honesty, ""2001: Space Odyssey"" is one of the first space movies that was ahead of it's time in a technical aspect, with regards to special effects and camera work. However, if you want some great science fiction watch the ""Star Wars"" saga.  As for a science fiction film that has a philosophical vibe to it, watch the original ""Solaris"".  Hell the remake with Clooney (which is honestly a great film) is light years better (pun intended) than this languid drivel!!!!!"	1.0	The cure for insomnia or a method to suicide?	2007-08-07	150	19	131

Laxson	"Okay, I can watch 20 minutes of a film without dialogue or fight scenes, but I can not watch 20 minutes of film without human emotion, and that is what this movie lacks entirely.If you find special effects entertaining then I feel very sorry for you, but I also warn you to avoid this film--its ""special effects"" are nothing more than flashing lights, [inexpensive] gorilla costumes, and model spaceships moving across a starry cosmos at an unbelievably slow speed.If you seek a story, I once again warn you to stay away. The film is a series of 4 or 5 loosely related tales, each outstaying its welcome. The attempt at a moral or philosophical message is overshadowed by the pseudo-innovative display of cinematic techniques. These techniques seem to take precedence over the film as a whole.  For example, the film opens with over 40 minutes of monkeys being monkeys. Only the last minute or so of this act contributes anything to the film or to the viewer; rather, it is like watching a documentary without the narration. Likewise the struggle of mankind and the grand journey that we are all on is portrayed through the 360-degree vertical rotation of the camera, as opposed to the portrayal of personal emotional issues or universal socio-political issues.  Also, apparently the improvement of the human race has something to do with multi-colored landscapes and black stones . . . I'm still trying to figure out that convoluted (if even existent) symbolism.Overall, the film is nothing more than a two and a half hour endorsement of the faulty theory of evolution-which has since been disproved-and it somehow managed to gain critical favor and suddenly a bandwagon formed for those seeking to profess themselves as fans of ""art cinema,"" when in actuality the film is as artistic as an Andy Warhol exhibit or a Yoko Ono album."	1.0	Why?	2002-02-05	33	6	27

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ	Todd7	2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a groundbreaking movie that set the stage for enormously successful sci-fi films in subsequent years, such as Star Wars, Close Encounters, and Alien. With its signature soundtrack, mellow approach, and scarce dialogue, it's a movie that lets the images tell the story. The visual effects are incredible for a movie that debuted in the late 1960's, especially the moon shots. The ships look dated and fake (by today's standards), yet they're not that inconsistent with the rest of the visuals. It would be almost a decade before the next visually stunning sci-fi masterpiece would debut (Star Wars); I suppose that no one really wanted to tackle an outer space movie and risk having the film look fake. 2001 succeeds on many levels, depicting evolution, technology, symbolism, and exploration. The special features include a commentary by Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood, as well as the theatrical trailer.

It's up to you, but there's a lot of meat on the bone for chewing up your mind for days and weeks after viewing this most extraordinary masterpiece.It's aged beautifully since 1968 and makes Star Wars look like a has-been.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is Kubrick's ultimate and timeless masterpiece.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	ALN0TTRTLHA4E	"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick"""	This is a film which in its time was seen as rather earth shattering. Its main draw card was the special effects in the first half of the film. These played with a background of music that somehow fitted.The problem is that special effects have improved out of sight since this film and it now seems rather dated. What you see on viewing it now is a film that is rather lacking in anything else but special effects.The &quot;plot&quot; of the film if it can be called that concerns the role of black monoliths in human history. The suggestion is that they trigger an evolutionary leap in human conciousness. The first scene involves some actors dressed in monkey suits. One of them touches the mysterious black monolith and suddenly he is able to use tools.Switch to 2001 and another monolith is found on the moon pointing to a moon of Jupiter. A space ship is sent off to find it.The film has almost no dialogue. (Which fits in with the almost total lack of plot). An uppity computer causes some problems on the mission and then our hero is drops into a confused set of images. It was generally thought that Kubrick ran out of money half way through the film and had to use flashing lights and funny wavey lines to pad out the last 40 minutes.During the 60's and 70's this last 40 minutes was thought somehow to be &quot;deep&quot;. However in reality it is simply tiresome. In the end we see that the screne is filled with a gigantic fetus. Symbolism meaning that man is about to be &quot;reborn&quot; and to move up the evolutionary table again. Wow.Star Wars is in reality a more interlectual film as it at least was one of the first films to break with the old notion of women just being sex objects, and that they could join in the action.	1.0	Well maybee if you are really high on drugs	2002-01-19	33	6	27

I would agree with other reviewers remarking  on the graininess of the video as well as other artifacts. Also, why have  an essentially blank screen at the beginning and in the middle? Unlike a  theatrical presentation, viewers at home can pause the film at any point in  the film. Further, the &quot;interview&quot; with Mr. Clarke is really just  a film of the studio press conference at the film's premiere. Shame on  Turner for such a shoddy production.	2.0	Turner Wastes DVD Technology	2000-02-07	5	4	1

Have been interested in watching all the Kubrick films since he is hailed as a top director of his time. Anyways... 2001 a space odyssey is fairly interesting. being a movie that i guess came out in 1968 I can see this being an epic mindblow of proportions. it has great scenes, soundtrack, ideas and visuals. so i can understand all the praise the movie has. but really if this movie had come out in today's age 2010 i don't know. think it would have been a love it or hate it movie that would fade away into obscurity. personally i dont' know... it's decent but nothing i would praise or watch again. i do and can understand people that watched this in it's origninal release still seeing it as great for what it is and i can understand that. anyways... epic for 60's. ok for 2010. the visuals playing orchestrated music did nothing for me. seemed like more of a way to make the movie longer and kill time	2.0	ahead of it's time. but does not age well for a new generation	2010-08-14	15	1	14
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A16FZHGEA8Q7Z4	troubadour	"In 1968, Stanley Kubrick released a movie that has influenced both the making of science fiction films and our conceptions of what the future may hold. This movie, 2001: A Space Odyssey was co-written by Mr. Kubrick and the preeminent science fiction author, Sir Arthur C. Clarke. The basic theme behind 2001 is the progress of humanity from the early ""missing links"" to perfection in the future.2001 is a movie steeped deeply in symbolism. The most evident case is the black monoliths of stone, which appear to propel humanity further along the evolutionary path. It is interesting to note that the movie proposes that humanity might not have been able to rise from its primordial beginnings without otherworldly intervention. Are these monoliths the touch of either God or some higher, god-like race? That seems to be the implication.Something else that is interesting about the monoliths is that there is always some sort of barrier between the human and the monolith itself. In the first instance, it is the fur of the early ""ape-men"". At the second contact, it is the space suits. The third and final time humans make contact with the monoliths, David Bowman is cocooned within the space pod that carries him beyond infinity.The choice by Kubrick and Clarke to name the main character Bowman is not sheer coincidence. The movie is subtitled A Space Odyssey. This surname is reminiscent of Homer's epic poem, the Odyssey, in which Odysseus announces his return home by shooting an arrow through twelve iron axe heads with his hunting bow. This reference to the bow is reminiscent of the final scene of the man-ape using a bone as a weapon, implying that humanity is still primitive through its reliance on violence and force. When Bowman is changed into the Star-Child, this reliance on weaponry has ended and humanity can now move on to a higher plain of existence.2001 has a very distinctive feel, a unique overall mis en sc&egrave;ne. Part of this is produced by the usage of lights and lighting through out the movie. In two scenes, light is emanated directly by walls or the floors. The sun is used quite a bit also. It repeatedly appears hovering just over celestial bodies, such as the earth and the moon. Additionally, it appears at the top of the first monolith, even further cementing the extraterrestrial nature of the monoliths. This also draws upon the capabilities of the human race as it progresses. The man-apes are only able to manipulate the most primitive tools, such as bones of dead animals. However, the lunar monolith is brightly lit by artificial synthetic lights, indicating the race's development.Instead of using a new score, Kubrick chose to use a soundtrack of older classical pieces. One of the most famous pieces he picked was The Blue Danube Waltz By Johann Strauss, Jr. This piece was used during the space flights between the earth and the moon. This entails that future humanity feels that its forays into space heightens the species' over all culture and civility. Also at some points, there is no music whatsoever.Kubrick's choices in the scenery of 2001 also marked the movie's distinctive mis en sc&egrave;ne. All of it is very sterile, very clean. Hardly anything green grows on the savannah; there are wide expanses of open, arid scenery that are punctuated by rocks and skeletons. Much of the movie consists of shots of different spaceships floating through vacuum. Everything in the future settings is very functional. Even when Dave and Hal play chess, they do it on a computer screen, thus eliminating moving parts. Also, the computer is multipurpose, both for work and pleasure."	5.0	Steeped in Symbolism	2005-07-31	1	1	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	ANN4JW1E08AS6	tuberacer	"This is Kubrick's majestic masterpiece.  That moment when those primates wake-up and find that monolith in their lair is one of the most metaphysically majestic images in art history, and terrifyingly so.  And then the movie continues on to more.  So many people seem affronted by this movie because, as they often say, they don't ""get it.""  The stories in Kubrick's movies are pretty straightforward. 2001 can be summed up thus (BIG TIME SPOILER WARNING HERE--BEWARE!!!): evolution to a higher form is stimulated by an alien presence which also plants a beacon on the moon which is triggerd by touch to send a signal of the earth creature's thusly accomplished progression toward another beacon floating off Jupiter where there is a stargate through which A man, having abandoned the now defunct technologies,  travels to a place where he is caused into the next evolution.  (SPOILER OVER). Get it?  No you don't. The difference between most movies and some movies--like Kubrick's--and especially Kubrick's--is that most movies you WATCH.  You watch to follow the story.  On one level you watch a Kubrick movie and follow the story.  On another, and more important level, you LOOK at a Kubrick movie. Famously, a lot of work went into the production of a Kubrick movie.  His best movies are the accumulation of a lot of perfections--and I mean, A LOT! (technically, I should probably use a term something like ""perfecteds"" instead of ""perfections,"" to be correctly humble about the creative process). In comparison, you watch a big-budget George Lucas movie--those self-proclaimed one-take wonders--eq. Star Wars.  You watch and follow his wiz-bang Jedi science fiction story with all its explosive space battles and are entertained, oblivious to the constantly violated fact, for instance, that in reality THERE IS NO SOUND IN SPACE!!! Hello? By contrast, you watch and you LOOK at a Kubrick movie.  There may be a hundred takes to get someone to scratch his nose ""right"" in the ""right"" environment. And ""right"" means it is sound factually and artistically. You look and you appreciate how ""right"" that and that is, and you know that you are looking at art--it has a taste--and this appreciation of such a symphony of perfections creates in the attuned viewer a cumulative effect.  There is a certain learning on this level of sustained Looking.  Unless you aspire to, and have the patience to experience this particular overarching effect, you will not ""get"" a good Kubrick movie, even if you ""get"" the story. 2001 is Kubrick's metaphysical majestic dazzle beyond compare--hyper real, more than science fiction, and somehow, more than a movie. It's a movie that changes the chemistry of our selfconsciousness.  It's effect can, and should last a lifetime.  It's hard to imagine being in this modern age without at some point in your life having been effected by this movie.  I only hope that everyone inspired by this movie can also see it, if they haven't already, in the full widescreen theater cinemascope which it was intended to be viewed in.  As has been said so many times before, it's the ultimate trip."	5.0	Why you don't get it.	2005-03-22	4	2	2

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A5FO4JH9Z4SRO	Tyler C. Rayner	Kubrick's science fiction masterpiece cannot be measured by the same benchmarks as other movies. When you hear comments about a thin plot, or weak dialog, you can immediately discredit the review, because it misses the point. This was history's greatest director during his prime- no aspect of this film is off in any way.2001's portrait of &quot;the future&quot;, or the theoretical recent past as is the case now, is neither a bleak, grim, nor optimistic outlook. It is simply a bland, sterile, emotionless state of human existence. It could be mistaken for weak dialog or poor acting, but it is all entirely with purpose. Contrast with Dr. Strangelove for an example of Kubrick's ability to paint human nature at its most hot-blooded. The dialog mirrors the visuals- white/gray, sterile, clean, flawless, cold.This film is pure Kubrick from top to bottom. It takes full advantage of the freedom afforded by the science fiction genre, and creates the most visually engrossing masterpiece the genre has ever known. This is not a film that continually massages the viewer's short attention span. If it gets you, it gets you... if it misses you, it misses you. 2001 does not cheapen itself with any Hollywood gimmick for the sake of mass-appeal.This is one of the all-time greats. It it makes an impression on you, the impression will be lasting and incredibly powerful.	5.0	Film-art at its finest	2003-10-13	10	9	1

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1OLZDXGW288BW	Tyler Peterson	If you were looking for one word to sum up this film, mystical would do pretty well.  We're used to filmmakers explaining their intentions; with this movie Stanley Kubrick shows us that the lack of an explanation will linger in your memory far, far longer.Consider the black monument that appears several times throughout the movie.  We know it is essential to all that is humanity, for evolution takes amazing turns shortly after meeting it.  But what in the name of God is it?  We have no idea.  It could be the work of absolutely anything; all we see is a seamless rectangle that is, apparently, the single most important object in the universe.  And that's why 2001: A Space Odyssey is a movie that will leave you in stitches long after you watch it--provided you make the effort to understand it.If you're completely baffled by this movie, keep in mind that there is one overriding message.  I can't give it away, for it would spoil everything.  But it has something to do with what Arthur C. Clarke would call &quot;the tyranny of matter.&quot;And, as a last note, I didn't find this movie boring.  At all.  Things do happen very slowly in space; everybody who's been there says it's a place both of beauty and leisure.  So I think the relaxed pace of this movie, together with the music of the Blue Danube waltz, actually captures the essence of space travel very well.	5.0	It's not what they tell you, but what they don't tell you	2002-11-26	6	5	1

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A16GAIJJE39T1S	Ulfilas	A great movie that I first saw as a sixteen year old in 1968.  I was immediately struck by the attempt to depict a realistic space journey.  No shooting of aliens with lasers.  No noisy blast off.  No Art Deco rocket ships.  No magical technology.  A huge and clunky ship with a fission reactor at the back to power what I assume (I never read the book) to be something like a cesium ion rocket--with the long backbone reaching to the crew cabin to allow a degree of separation from the reactor's radiation.  For artificial gravity, you have nothing fancier than centrifugal force.  Meanwhile on a lunar shuttle, men make the everyday decision between chicken and ham sandwiches for lunch.My kids, brought up on much more special effects and action than somebody of my generation, found this movie boring.

As for being  photographic and having great special effects, I really don't see what you  are referencing - 60 minutes of space shuttle scenes? If you want a  photographic film see Pi or Vagabond - covering up a lack of plot with  claims of filmic excellence is not possible with 2001.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A198A6DH2RQ5I6	Valmont28	Just a quick review of the commentary here -- Gary Lockwood's is absolutely terrible. He brings nothing insightful to the film. Most of the time he is either simply describing exactly what is happening on the screen as you're watching it, or rambling on about what a rebel he was back in the day. Keir Dullea on the other hand, gives us more insight on how certain scenes were filmed and the thought processes behind them. Unfortunately, Keir talks a LOT less than Gary.  I would estimate that Lockwood is talking for 80% of the film.*Trying to avoid spoilers here*Another thing I didn't like was how they had Dullea and Lockwood talk about the scenes in the beginning of the movie that didn't involve them. I felt that they should have brought in the actors who portrayed those roles in order to give us more insight into those scenes.Other than that, the film is extraordinary.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2Z5S6CA3QVC19	V. Hall	Great movie.  While not for everyone, the methodical pace gives any science fiction buff the chance to appreciate the lengths to which the technology of space travel was extrapolated by Clarke.  Even from today's technology the design of the space ships, the protocols, the methods, even the food seem reasonable expectations of what long distance space travel might look like in the future.  Clarke is brilliant.The film has aged surprisingly well with its special effects.  The zero gravity camera tricks are still inventive and appreciable, though sometimes require a touch of suspension of disbelief early in the film.Extras such as the commentary are very good.  Keir Dullea (who plays David Bowman) in particular seems to be very intelligent and has some very insightful things to say.  Unfortunately Gary Lockwood seems to be just the opposite, though at least both seem to still have the experience of shooting the film fresh in their minds.  There are several other very well produced shorts of the production which are surprising to have available given the age of the film.  They are every bit as good as some of the extras I typically see on more modern movies at least in quality of content.The transfer and remaster to Blu-ray is surprisingly good and worthy of getting the Blu-ray over the DVD.  Since it was shot in 70mm there is a lot of detail and very little or no grain.  This is a great movie to use to show off your big HD TV, at least assuming you have good black levels!	5.0	Great film, great product, great transfer, great Blu ray	2011-12-26	3	3	0

Also observe the stiff-legged walk of the stewardess in space, and the inelegant hats designed to keep long hair from floating haphazardly around the head.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	ADTA83BVV65IS	"""vincegerman"""	I have read a thousand reviews of this work, and the majority of them miss the point. &quot;2001&quot; is, to be sure, a visual and aural banquet, but we should strive to put aside the magnificent special effects and the  hypnotic soundtrack. At the risk of disorienting a worldwide community of  SF buffs, it must be said that this is not a science fiction movie. It is  just a movie about us. Let's calm down and try to discern something of the  true essence of Kubrick's beautiful pictorial essay.A dry, stripped  bone becomes the first murder weapon in the paws of an early hominid. It is  also, of course, the first tool. Pain, and development. Rejoicing, our  ancestor hurls the bone into the air. It soars and then falls, tumbling. We  progress four million years as the rotating bone blends smoothly into the  image of a spacecraft orbiting our planet. Mankind's technological and  cultural advances are astounding. But how far have we really come, what  prices have we paid, and where are we all headed?  Kubrick signals his  intent when we see our first example of modern man, aboard the spacecraft.  The man is asleep. He is detached, and indifferent. What is at the end of  our journey?  A featureless and monolithic slab serves as punctuation in  Kubrick's essay. It is not God, nor is it an alien, and nor is it an alien  artifact. It is just a period placed by Kubrick at the ends of four  chapters. At each fleeting apparition, we witness an ostensibly progressive  transition, typically accompanied by pain. Pain, and development. In the  world of 2001, the distracted energies expended upon increasingly complex  technology have drained our ever-shallow pool of humanity into the very  machines we have made. We have not come very far, even as the essay  persistently takes us further in space, away from the earthly cradle. Dr.  Heywood Floyd, modern man's representative, caresses the monolith on the  lunar surface with a bewilderment reminiscent of that displayed by the  primitive hominids on earth four million years earlier.The culmination  of all our efforts is HAL, a sentient and talkative computer aboard a  (bone-shaped) spaceship en route to the planet Jupiter. HAL has not one  strand of our DNA in his circuits, yet he is the most human of all the  characters inhabiting the landscape of 2001.  During a long and transfixing  sequence in which his CPU is slowly disabled by vacuous astronaut David  Bowman, HAL gently declares &quot;I can feel it...I can feel it&quot;, over  and over again.  At this point in the story we face the prospect of a world  in which humanity (or, at least, human-ness) has been extinguished,  ironically in HAL's red and womb-like CPU chamber. The monolith appears and  completes another chapter.Watch carefully during the wordless final  reel of this unique and superb movie. The conclusion is deliberately vague,  and purposely and endlessly fluid. Perhaps we finish right where we  started, and begin again. It's up to you. Do not look to Clarke's book for  explanation. The novel was written during and after the making of the film  and, as told by Clarke, the movie is 90% Kubrick and 10% Clarke, and vice  versa for the book. By its nature, there is no definitive explanation of  the ending to the movie. For a very long double bill, I would recommend  pairing the film with Tarkovsky's mesmerizing &quot;Solaris&quot; (1971). I  would not recommend &quot;2010&quot; by Hyams (1984), which is a literal,  weak and wooden-headed attempt to extend Kubrick's work.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3T689SS856U3N	Vincent Lassauw	"As for decades many critics have maintained that Citizen Kane is the best movie of all time, likewise 2001, A Space Odyssey is considered the best sci-fi movie of all time, even though originally many critics weren't exactly brimming with enthusiasm, but that was a standard phenomenon after each Kubrick release. Well it is tempting to go against popular opinion and in the case of Citizen Kane I do, even though it's a great film, but far from the best movie ever (it's not even Welles' best), but as far as this movie is concerned I bow to the masterpiece that this work of art by Kubrick represents.Let me begin by addressing the two most heard points of criticism concerning this movie:1) The movie is too slow and as a result boring.This of course is a subjective experience from any viewer and I think due to harboring wrong expectations of a significant portion of this group. A considerable part of sci-fi lovers comes at this genre from quite a different kettle of fish, as one can see at sci-fi favorite's lists at various movie forums. A Star Wars fan will probably think of quite different movies as opposed to a fan of Tarkovsky's ""Solaris"". Not that one excludes the other, which would be oversimplifying things.Apart from that there is a significant number of intellectually somewhat challenged people, whose attention span will not cross the magic 4 second barrier: to them I indeed do not recommend this movie.More so, the 'slowness' of this movie is one of its big plusses.2) The movie is incomprehensible.The complexity of this movie is about the only thing that's overrated in my view.Under the pre-condition one watches the movie somewhat focused and takes the time absorbing and thinking about it, no Einsteinian brain power, or even that of a remote relative of this honorable man, is required to understand it.Of course, again there is this group of viewers that have an outspoken aversion to prompt any brain cells that may exist into action. There are those that simply detest having to look for answers themselves and expect a movie to resolve any possible duality in plot interpretation.The fact a movie may inspire multiple interpretations, should only be a source of interesting debate and not considered a failing of the movie as it surely is an aspect of great art that it is a living organism, that, through its perception lives on and evolves.What makes Kubrick's movie stand out within movie history in general and the sci-fi genre in particular?A few aspects:- The storyThe story entails a vision of grandeur and elegance concerning the physical and spiritual evolution of mankind and gives it a fascinating, and at that time original, spin through an alien civilization being at the basis of every crucial evolutionary step. It poses questions that touch the core of our spiritual and physical roots and the next leap we might make in this grand scheme. The film gives its own splendid and captivating answer to these questions, to which the validity of this answer is not so much important as the way the confrontation with it as a viewer resonates within us.- Cinematography2001 has images that, once seen, you will never ever forget and even now, 40! years after its release, remain fresh and visionary. The breath taking panoramas of pre-historic earth, the majesty of space and beautiful space station/ship interior designs are unforgettable.- FXThe special effects in the movie were far ahead of their time, never before or since was there a movie that instantly made all predecessors within a movie genre look antiquated and visually into a B-category movie.Think of the beauty of the lunar landscape images, even though nobody had ever even been there at the time, the far ahead of its time computer generated images.-EditingThe editing is truly sublime in this movie: just think of the classic scene of the bone thrown into the air transitioning into a docking space shuttle; the way Bowman sees himself aging at the end.Of course even more important is the tempo of the movie determined by the editing, that indeed is quite slow. It is however a great plus of the movie, as the viewer gets all the time  to ""travel along"" and take it all in, giving the audience in such an unique way a chance to experience the overwhelming beauty of the universe, turning it into a spiritual experience.- SoundtrackAgain unique and never equaled in my personal view and extremely moving:Ligeti's ""Requiem"" at the appearance of the monolith, his ""Lux Aeterna"" during the Lunar flight as well as his ""Athmosph&egrave;res"" during the final odyssey part ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite"".They are quite contemporary works and admittedly I enjoy some of contemporary classical music a lot  and consider Ligeti's Requiem  to be the most impressive oratory of the 20th century, but more importantly, the effect with the appearance of the monolith is astounding (to whom it may be interesting, the piano music in Kubrick's swansong ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is also Ligeti's, although be it written 30 years later), as is ""Lux Aeterna""  creating this texture of mystery and impending revelation so magnificently.The use of a Strauss waltz while the space shuttle is docking without any dialogue  for minutes at a time is one of the highlights of the movie and a stroke of pure genius.  Before I saw this movie I wasn't exactly what one would call a fan of the waltzes composed by any within the Strauss family or this piece in particular. After seeing this movie I considered it to be of a gracious beauty that I would never forget.Khatchaturians tragic ballet music heard during the first images of the spaceship ""Discovery"" creates this great atmosphere of impending tragedy, which will befall most of its crew. Later Cameron quoted this music at the opening of his movie ""Aliens"", as a tribute I presume.The music of course that everybody associates this movie with, Richard Strauss' ""Also sprach Zarathustra"" is majestic at both beginning and end of the movie.Well, I could continue on about several aspects of this movie that now for 40 years signifies a watershed within the genre and has become that shining star dominating the sci-fi sky and rightly so.It is a movie that can move a viewer on many levels, confronting us once again with who we are, where we come from and possible destiny as a species in a work of great audio-visual splendor, which, like all great art will undoubtedly stand the test of time.Actor Keir Dullea, playing the iconic character of Dave Bowman in the movie, once articulated it beautifully:""It resonates in people because it touches on the instant our wonder - not only our wonder about space, but our wonder about time, our wonder with our relationship to the Deity perhaps - because you get as many interpretations of what the film means as you do almost people who have seen it. That's true of almost any great work of art - if you see a Picasso, is it important to know what Picasso intended, or is it important to know what your relationship is, your emotional reaction is to it?"""	5.0	Splendor in the Sky	2008-09-09	11	10	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A2JA7C0WEMB1M7	"Virgil ""Virgil"""	"2001 A Space Odyssey is a profoundly made film of the future by Kubrick. This is a film that requires patience from the audience and each is left to decide on his or her own impressions by the end of the film. Although there is some great dialogue (especially by ""Hal"") words are not most lasting feature, in fact no words are spoken until at least 30 minutes or so into the film. It's visually stunning, even now thirty five years later, it hasn't failed to create an impression on new audiences.There have been some great reviews on this site, so I won't delve into the plotline. What is interesting is the contrast between another science fiction film from an equally great filmaker released around the same time- Solaris. To the Soviets, 2001 was the ""capitalist"" version of the future while Solaris was a humane, marxist version of what was to come. While they obviously got 2001 basically wrong, these two films together create a great contrast.Based loosely on an Arthur C. Clarke story The Sentinel, Kubrick reworked a large portion of it with Clarke to adapt it to the screen while trying to remain loyal to the written version. Especially impressive is the soundtrack- especially Strauss' ""Also Spake Zarathustra"".There are so many scenes in which are timeless: the monolith, the bone thrown into the air that becomes a space vehicle, the revolving space station, the conversation between the astronauts in the space pod, Hal's daisy song and the star gate sequence near the end.If you ever get the opportunity to see this in a theater take advantage of it. In my opinion this is Kubrick's best film and one of the best films ever made."	5.0	A visionary film	2002-09-10	5	5	0

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1A8KJ066DQ3US	Warren J. Dew	"2001 was one of the first - perhaps the first - film title to be relased in DVD format.  Unfortunately, that first edition didn't take advantage of the capabilities of the format.  In particular, it achieved the original ""wide screen"" viewing format by letterboxing - including black stripes above and below the content area - which meant that when viewed on a wide screen television or computer display, there were unused black areas on all four sides.  That really didn't do justice to the film.The present single disk DVD edition corrects that problem, using the anamorphic wide screen option to present the film in its original 2.35:1 format using the full width of the display.  It also includes the overture and the intermission, and the DVD reencoding seems to have been done with more care, which significantly improves the viewing quality.  Since much of this film's impact comes from the cinematography and visual effects, these improvements are critically important.  The cardboard and hard plastic package is in my opinion not as good as the standard soft plastic DVD packaging, but that's a minor issue in comparison to the better viewing format.Note that as of this writing (16 August 2004), the ""collector's set"" apparently uses the older letterbox format.  If you're going to spring for the collector's set, I'd advise also getting the anamorphic disc to put inside it.For those who aren't sure whether they want the film, there are reasons for the differing reviews.  For one thing, the two creative talents behind it - Stanley Kubrick, the director, and Arthur C. Clarke, the writer - had rather different outlooks on technology, with Kubrick tending to emphasize the negatives while Clarke was fundamentally optimistic about technological progress.  The result is a film that encourages you to think for yourself, with pacing that allows you to do so.  You don't have to, of course - some who saw it in the 60s say that the ""light show"" monolith entry scene is best viewed while stoned - but the film isn't at its best as light entertainment.Fortunately, Kubrick's cinematography and Clarke's solid grounding in science and technology result in excellent space scenes.  They aren't flashy because that's not what space technology is really like:  instead, the sequences illustrate the time required to, for example, carefully dock a spacecraft, and Kubrick and Clarke rightly decided that the stark beauty of a realistic representation of space scenes needed no embellishment.An argument can be made that the film was more relevant in 1968, when men were first going to the moon, than today.  On the other hand, with private space exploration just starting to get off the ground today, perhaps the film can serve as a reminder of the things that many of us once dreamed would be achieved by the turn of the century - and perhaps an inspiration for those who still seek to achieve them soon, if not by the film's title date of 2001."	5.0	Get This Classic in Anamorphic DVD Format	2004-08-16	11	9	2

"First, I have to say I can't compare this to the HD-DVD edition because I don't own it although I'm sure they are of similar quality since they use the same encoding but this is probably the best transfer I've ever seen for the film bar none. There's a volume of detail that has been missed in previous versions of this film on home video and, while the newly remastered regular DVD comes looks marvelous, it can't hold a candle to the Blu-ray edition of this film. While the transfer isn't perfect, it's pretty darn close. There are some scenes where the images are a bit soft (that's to be expected from a film that's 40 years old to some extent)but color and detail are exceptional throughout the film.As with the DVD version there is a commentary track by Gary Lockwood and Keir Dullea. There are large sections of silence and points where they comment on the obvious (and some of Dullea's comments are duplicated in the documentary on the making of the film)but it is nice to have both of them discuss the making of the film even if it does fall into the mundane. They both truly would have benefited from a moderator to spur them into discussing more about the making of the film and their careers after ""2001"" became hailed as the best science fiction film of all time and the most pretentious epic film ever made.I would be curious as to whether there are those who have compared the HD-DVD to the Blu-ray just for completist but can highly recommend this terrific Blu-ray of one of Kubrick's most ambitious and controversial films ever (of course that could also be said of ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" as well)."	5.0	Stunning looking Blu-ray transfer a highlight of re-release	2007-12-16	2	1	1
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3CFT5LHFCB46K	"""weirdo_87"""	"The final human words said in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", before the movie reverts to a language told by visuals. These words I chose because they apply the most to this movie. Its origin is well known (Made in England under the direction of the late Stanley Kubrick), but what about its purpose? Is this movie a religious journey? Is it a study of '60's beliefs in the pre-computer and Vietnam era? Or is it a study in the advancement, or decline, of the human race? This movie is all those things but it is also more.It is said that people are always afraid of change and this movie is a perfect example. As many people have so bluntly pointed out, this movie is long and rather difficult to get into. It is widely considered, along with ""Citizen Kane"", to be the most overrated movie of all time. But is this because you didn't it a chance? Many people who watch this movie (Considered to be THE science fiction movie) probably expect it to action packed, only to find just the opposite. That's because, in my view, ""2001"" was meant to be this way, as a sort of satire on the future of the human race. Kubrick strips humans of any emotions, making the ""advanced"" people of the future as dull as the apes they came from (Yes, I do believe in Darwinism). The movie moves at super slow speed and has no major excitement until near the very end. The establishing scenes in the film (Apart from the ""Dawn of Man"" prologue) also show that despite the advancements in comfort and safety, space travel is no more exhilarating than regular air travel. It is as routine and uneventful as anything else. But is every single movie supposed to be a two-hour video game?A common theme throughout Kubrick's films was the relationship of man and machines. Kubrick suggests that the dullness of the humans is due to the advancement of technology, to the point where anything can be done at the press of a button. The ""Hal 9000"" computer is a very good example of man letting its technological development going too far. Hal, like the doomsday machine in ""Dr. Strangelove"", fulfills its mission at the cost of human life. Indeed, he was correct when it said it was ""The fault of human error"". ""2001"" also shows that though we have immensely evolved intellectually and physically, humans are still only apes in disguise when it comes to social skills and survival skills. The conversations on the spacestation (Mostly with standard phrases and words and not with much emotion or enthusiasm) and the actions of David Bowman after Frank Poole's murder (Leaving the ship to Hal's control and forgetting his space helmet) are all good examples.So, if you plan to watch this movie for the first time, try not to expect as much excitement as the ""Star Wars"" movies combined. Rather, give it a chance and watch it from a different perspective. Open up your mind and allow the movie to unfold before you. It will take more than one viewing before you fully appreciate the movie. However, if you feel you need help, read Arthur C. Clarke's novel. Not only is it the film's Cliffs Notes, but it's also a great read.""2001"" is a movie that will still be standing tall and influencing people for generations to come. Some of its hardware and ideals, I admit, look dated by our standards. But, as my dad pointed out, this film's predictions might have been correct in one way. Onboard the Discovery spacecraft, David Bowman and Frank Poole watch a news broadcast on a flat panel television screen, which (According to the novel) can display any sort of visual and printed material. If that isn't the Internet, than I don't know what it is."	5.0	"""...Its origin and purpose, still a total mystery"""	2002-04-01	6	5	1

I like having my brain cells stimulated by a film.  I appreciate a movie when it makes me ponder it for the next couple of days.  The only thing ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" did for me was force me to ponder why I wasted a perfectly good friday night with my buddies in Boston to watch it.I came to college not having seen any of Stanley Kubrick's films and having witnessed all of you intellectual types going into orgasmic convulsions as the very mention of his name, I decided to start with 2001: A Space Odyssey...I really really wanted to like this movie, I swear.  I even sat there for the first hour and a half, eyes glued to the screen, waiting for something to happen, some sort of event that would justify my past 90 minutes of inactivity.  I watched as no plot or characters were developed, as the silence became uncomfortable (and not artful like you Kubrick lovers claim), leaving the brilliant special effects to stand out on their own as the sole achievement of this film.  I have never seen two murders look so benevolent.  I almost wanted the astronauts to die having been forced to listen to their trivial and dull dialogue.Kubrick was able to build the tension so well...and then he did absolutely nothing with it.  Some of you may claim that this makes the movie amazing...I disagree.  If you enjoyed the movie for its lack of payoff and plot, all of you Kubrick disciples must be big fans of Napolean Dynamite as well.  Except that movie had humorous moments.The worst part of it all was the ending, and I know some of you will explode on me for saying that.  I know you almost just pooped yourself in anticipation of trying to explain to me what all the trippy colors and kaleidoscope effects really mean, because ""you actually get it.""  Good for you.  I hope you didn't spend too much of your life pondering it.  I'm sure if I spent five minutes pulling garbage out of my ass I could come up with a passable explanation as well, but it just isn't worth it.  Regardless of what it really signifies, it only serves to annoy the viewer and give him/her a headache if they look too long at the screen.  Great move Stanley.I have since rented more Kubrick films to see if 2001 was an outliar, an anomaly, something to prove that his fan club is not on hallucinogens of some kind.  And well...the results were inconclusive.  A Clockwork Orange was a film with an intriguing premise followed by an abhorrent second half of nothingness.  The Shining was indeed quite creepy, but again lacked a satisfying ending.  Full Metal Jacket had one helluva first half until R. Lee Ermy departed, leaving it mired in a sub-par vietnam war flick.  I have no desire to see Eyes Wide Shut, as one doesn't have to travel to blockbuster to obtain porn.One last thing - to those of you who constantly criticize us ""younger folk"" as not being smart enough to understand and appreciate the complexity of Kubrick films:  get off your high horses.  Simply because we grew up in a different generation does not mean we can't grasp the artistic genius of filmmakers.  Perhaps we just can't see what you can, but if that means sitting through 2001:  A Space Odyssey one more time, I'm all set, thanks."	2.0	yayyy Stanley Kubrick love-fest...	2006-01-20	24	11	13

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	ARFCORBCTKX1J	"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer"""	"I saw ""2001"" in its original run, first at the Broadway Cinerama theater in New York, then at the DC Cinerama. At both theaters I was surprised at the poor image quality, though I assumed it was due to projecting an image -- even one on 70mm film -- on such a large screen.The principal problem was an overall softness and lack of detail, with generally desaturated colors. It was if there was a lot of scattered light (flare) in the optical system, of the sort caused by grease marks on the lenses. The curved Cinerama screen doesn't help, either, as it allows the brighter areas of the image to ""spill over"" into the darker.The Blu-ray disk - presumably derived from the negative -- is a revelation. ""2001"" looks totally different. The images are razor-sharp, with great detail and natural-to-slightly high saturation. The ""trip"" sequence is an eye-popper. And you can almost read the zero-gravity toilet instructions.The Blu-ray sound is disappointing, weighted toward the treble, and not very clean. (No, it's not my system, thank you.) A darker, richer, more ""theatrical"" sound is needed.Other than the sound, the only thing wrong with the Blu-ray disk is that even 60"" isn't enough. &lt;ahem> You really need to see ""2001"" on a huge screen that fills your field of view, particularly in the sequence where Moonwatcher throws a bone into the air, and it falls back as a similarly shaped spacecraft, one of the most breathtaking moments in movie history. The docking sequence that follows similarly requires a big screen. Neither is as effective on home video as in the theater, despite the much better image quality of the former.As for the film's science and metaphysics... ""2001"" divided critics, with the ever-shallow-and-self-serving Pauline Kael proclaiming it ""profoundly unimaginative"". Most critics were kinder, with a few negative reviewers reversing themselves after a few weeks.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3T46X7M3AUDAB	William Timothy Lukeman	"I first saw this film when I was 14, in the year it came out - and to say I was dazzled, confounded, stirred to my soul, is understating my reaction. Certainly I didn't understand its depths at that point, but the surface alone was enough to captivate me & make me think. Since that time, several decades have passed, and I've watched it many times over, gaining more with each viewing.The wildly divergent opinions in the previous reviews tell a story all their own, and demonstrate what a cultural & philosophical Rorschach test this film truly is -- love it or loathe it, there don't seem to be many neutral responses to it. It's definitely not a film for those with short attention spans, or those who want to stay inside a very secure comfort zone. Comfort is the last thing it offers!No need to offer a synopsis. Even if you haven't seen it yet, its themes & images are known to just about everyone -- the apes, the monolith, HAL. Anyway, this isn't a typical narrative. It's much more of a symphonic poem than a regular plot-driven story -- you should surrender yourself to it. The slow, measured pace is integral to understanding it on a deep, visceral level, because it takes the viewer outside of ordinary time, allowing us to set aside the distracting speed & information overload of everyday life.So, we're in cosmic time here, an oceanic infinity where the everyday no longer applies, where swarms of byte-sized factoids are irrelevant. In a way, it's like meditation -- slowly shutting off the chatter of the monkey mind, so that we gradually become aware of something far more immense & vast.It's not a thrill ride of sensation & immediate gratification. It's intensity of experience, building gradually & inexorably to a crescendo, a breakthrough of perception. Rational, logical explanation isn't the point while watching ... although afterwards, you'll have plenty to think about & discuss with others!That discussion will cover a lot of ground, too -- the origins & ultimate fate of humanity, the nature of the universe, the essence of the sacred, the limits of technology, dehumanization, the meaning of existence -- and that's just the start. It offers questions, not answers, and challenges all who watch it to search for those answers themselves, within themselves.The depth psychologist Carl Jung once said that the hardest thing in the world for anyone to do is simply sit alone in an empty room with his or her thoughts. ""2001"" puts you in that room, just as it put Dave Bowman in the same room. A safe, familiar, but sterile room -- and he emerges from it reborn, ready to grow into his expanded universe. Like any great work of art, that's precisely what this film offers each viewer. As in Rilke's poem ""Archaic Torso of Apollo,"" it tells the viewer, ""You must change your life."" Whether you choose do so is up to you.To those who find it boring or meaningless -- wait awhile, then give it another try. Sooner or later, life will have you asking, ""What's it all about?"" Slow down, reflect, and you may find that the film opens up to you at last.Most highly recommended!"	5.0	A timeless & beautiful masterpiece	2008-11-20	9	8	1

I must say, though, if you want something to show off your HD set, and to show just how good a 40 year old movie can look, this is it. The movie looks like it could have  been shot yesterday using HD cameras. No film grain, colors are vibrant, blacks are true, edges are sharp and well defined, and background details really pop out of the screen. The sound is excellent for a film of this age, and will not disappoint. The sound field is rich, using all channels. Its not agressive surround, but it does make you feel immersed.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A23IOPI0D1OG7V	"WILLIE A YOUNG II ""willow"""	Simply put, this stands as the greatest science fiction film ever made. Since 1968, many filmmakers have attempted to duplicate Mr. Kubrick's fluid, languid, sprawling and deliberately slow rhythms, but to no avail. His technique here is so masterful it actually brings tears to my eyes. This film depressed me for weeks the first time I watched it. It seemed so cold, inhumane and insular. Then I realized, that's what I love about it! This widescreen edition puts into proper perspective, exactly what Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick had in mind.  A grand, sweeping indictment of man, his evolution from savagery, and his constant obsession with information  &amp; technology, and just how wrong things can go when we battle ourselves. We ultimately wind up starting all over again, but are never without a guardian angel (the Starchild) watching over us. This film is such a joyous visual feast, you may find yourself drifting off to sleep at first (the pacing is VERY SLOW,  but it works to the film's advantage) and if you do, rewind it, start at the overture, and pay very close attention, you will be richly rewarded for your patience. To call this film a masterpiece is a gross understatement. A work of brilliance and audacious thinking would be more like it. No film library is complete without it.	5.0	2001: Here At Last!	2001-06-12	2	2	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A1QF10TB8AYTA3	"Wilmar Luna ""Author of The Silver Ninja"""	Well friends, I know this review will sound a little blasphemous. But 2001: a space odyssey is quite possibly one of the most boring movies I have ever watched.Now hear me out, it definitely earned it's spot in the list of greatest movies of all time, but it certainly didn't get there because it was entertaining.No, this movie is a deliberately paced plod through some of the most AMAZING space special effects done in its time. From the way the pen floats in mid air, to people walking upside down, to the camera following in a centrifuge. This is simply one of the most visually interesting and well done movies I've seen in a while.But narrative? Plot? Pacing? Some of the absolute worst!I don't mind movies where I don't know what the heck is going on, but if you're going to go through the trouble of making an artsy movie that doesn't have a definitive plot or character arc, AT LEAST PICK UP THE PACE! It just boggles my mind how a director can think that sitting on a shot of a spaceship going down a platform is supposed to be interesting.The journey through space sequence was so damn long, that I actually started fast forwarding through the movie! Why... why... WHY? Did they feel it was necessary to drag things out like this?If you watch this movie for it's narrative, it's stitched together like a series of short stories that have a theme. There was definitely a lot of symbolism and metaphors throughout this movie and I can accept it for what it is. But the pacing is just annoying to have to sit through, especially when it doesn't seem to serve a purpose besides showing off how cool the effects look. So really, you can definitely watch this movie to see the illusion of non-gravity, but you may want to keep your finger on the fast forward button.	2.0	If you want to put yourself to sleep, watch this movie.	2013-10-01	8	4	4

Olsen ""BooksRock"""	"42 years after the release of Kubrick's mystical journey beyond the infinite, his near maniacal attention to detail continues to keep up with modern image technology. If it was in the frame, it mattered. Older films on Blu-Ray will continue to reveal painted wood for steel girders, and splattered set walls in the b.g for aging, plus make-up and costuming details never meant to be seen. Kubrick's 2001 on Blu-ray gives us the advantage of seeing details that the Super Panavision 70mm negative captured, but before now were never seen, or never seen well. As an example: in the space station, when Dr. Floyd is talking to the Russians, there is in the far background at the end of the space stations curve, a windowed room with people walking around. This was not visible before Blu-ray. Except for possibly 70mm theatrical situations, this detail could not have been seen on VHS or standard DVD. There are many other examples.Blu-ray works well for a perfectionist like Kubrick. I'm holding my breath on the hundreds of movies where the filmmaker filled the foreground and let the b.g. go, where, ""the audience won't miss what they didn't see,"" was the common catch-phrase. Blu-ray is unforgiving in that matter. Many new films, and especially ones bullet-riddled with CG, will not hold up to its scrutiny."	5.0	METHODICAL ATTENTION TO DETAIL PAYS OFF	2010-03-13	4	4	0
6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A37T74YNUYU776	Wstenfuchs	"This movie is remarkable for many reasons, but let me single out just one. It is a breathtaking exposition of the pagan, evolutionary, anti-religious view of the world that is prevalent among many intellectuals today. Man evolves from apes, creates ingenious technology, and is destined to become a god. The only help he receives is from even more advanced beings, presumably those who have already trod this path and have become little gods themselves. When evangelical Christians and others protest against the ""evolutionary worldview"", this is exactly the sort of thing they are thinking of, and this movie shows why it is so inspiring and satisfying to many people.At the same time, Kubrick and Clarke's vision is full enough to include some misgivings. The evolved men in the moon episode are banal, unimaginative dolts; it is not certain whether those who sent the monolith are beneficent; technology has become more of a master than a slave; Bowman's final transformation is conspicuously lonely. Could it be that the pagan view leads finally to despair? Like the oracle at Delphi, K&C; neither hide nor reveal but give a sign.

The crew have noticed none of this as they have taken the word of the men on high who have said HAL is a perfect machine and like all good foot soldiers do as they are directed. He then quite inexplicably kills the crew with the exception of Dave whom he allows back on to the main ship after his brief exploit in a shuttle to save one of his crew. HAL, now omnipotent master of the spacecraft seems powerless to prevent Dave from erasing his memory little by little; the one sweet moment of the movie is Hal singing ""Daisy,Daisy.."" as he's slowly terminated by a relatively impassive Dave.What then follows is a kaleidoscope of special effects which look fantastic for the first minute especially for a 1968 movie but by 5 minutes later when they finally subside we are more than grateful. Ending in a gorgeous room in a mansion we see an old guy in a double bed reaching out for the same slab of magnetic material that the apes had been rubbing and admiring in a curious and worshipful way at the opening of the movie. And then cue the star embryo...YAWWWWWWWWNNNNN.This movie is utterly bogus and benign but don't take my word for it check it out for yourself first WITH A RENTAL you'll be glad you did.

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A37R7QYQFBQCCR	"""yogsothoth666"""	Enigmatic, powerful, beautiful and prophetic are the ways you could describe this film. It is also very clear, because it sticks to one cluster of themes: life, death and technology. No one in the US, not even Steven Spielberg, has been able to do what Kubrick achieves in this film. He explains the reason for technology (to keep death away) and its result (death approaches). The dialogue and action are spread out over two and a half hours. Things move so slowly partially as a nod to the great Russian auteur Tarkovsky, but also so the audience can digest what it's just seen or heard and connect it to other events in the film. The other benefit of the absence of action and wordiness is that it is immensely easy to connect the dots, unlike the much more wordy Tarkovsky. It's closer to a blockbuster Heidegger feature than an arthouse one.An interesting footnote is that the film's concluding chapter was originally supposed to happen in an appraoch to Saturn. Kubrick couldn't fit Saturn's rings into his budget. So we get Jupiter instead. The Arthur C. Clarke novel has the final sequence happen over Saturn. The ancient god Saturn is the god of death. And at its limit, where death approaches, what does one find? Kubrick doesn't answer in words. But an infant is born. And the film ends with the immense jubilation of the opening of Strauss's Zarathustra. Let anyone who's cracked Levinas think about that.	5.0	The American Tarkovsky	2003-05-31	2	1	1

6302760046	2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]	A3S98L5B1SR9P1	Zack H.	"2001: A Space Odyssey is, as anyone will tell you, open to interpretation. In my opinion, ""2001"" approaches the theory of evolution. We begin at The Dawn of Man sequence. We see that our ape-man ancestors are driven by curiosity. At this point, man is weak and stupid, but he is also adaptable and energetic. A monolith appears and as the film progresses, we see how the apes learn how to use a primitive bone as a tool, hence the evolution of technology, and the apes eventually evolve into man. As one of the apes throws the bone into the air, a jump cut ensues, bringing us to the film's present time. Another monolith is discovered which descends from Jupiter, and it's on the moon.At the beginning of the ""Jupiter Mission"" sequence, astronauts David Bowman and Frank Poole, along with three scientists, who are in hibernation, set off for Jupiter on a spaceship named Discovery One, controlled by HAL 9000, a new, revolutionary computer system. The Discovery One is being sent to Jupiter - namely to find out what the monolith's transmission means, and where it goes. When HAL endangers the crew's lives and begins to malfunction, it's up to Dave to disconnect the computer, in order to save his life, then set forth to the home of the new monolith. We then enter the ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite"" sequence, as he is then sent into another dimension, where we see that his human body is laid to rest and he is reborn as a new member of the next evolutionary species: a starchild.I'll admit the movie is hard to appreciate, but if you can appreciate it for what it is, it is probably one of the most beautiful composed films in cinematic history. I haven't read the books, but the movie is enough for me, it can convey 101 different messages without a word.2001 has been my favorite film since I first saw it when I was about 14. It was the first time I watched a film and realized that there could be more to a movie than just the story on the screen. I watch it occasionally, but it is still fresh every time and still has the power to amaze. It continues to blow me away. The effects still bring a smile when I watch it now. My understanding of the film has also continued to grow and develop over the years. As has my understanding of HAL.I think Kubrick/Clarke has said that if anyone has understood this film, they (Kubrick and Clarke) have failed. You are not supposed to understand the ending, especially not the first time. I think the point of this film is that your are supposed to think about it for a long time. I like to think that Kubrick and Clarke left the ending open for everyone to interpret their own opinion on upcoming events after David Bowman is reborn as the star child. Also, you should check out the film ""2010"", which is a follow up to this movie (not directed by Kubrick - it was directed by Peter Hyams)."	5.0	The greatest film of all time?
