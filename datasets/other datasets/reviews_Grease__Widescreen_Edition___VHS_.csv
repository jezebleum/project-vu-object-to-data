0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AJAF1T6Q7XM94	A Customer	This was one of those 5 or 6 movies that my little daughter made me watch with her over and over every day after work for months.  I really didn't mind.  The only part I found painful was when Danny Zuko blew off his  pretty Australian girlfriend in front of his friends.  Her name was Sandy,  right?  But wasn't that the name of the dog in Annie, another of my  daughter's favorites?  I'm getting confused.  After 8 million viewings of  Annie followed by another 8 million of Grease I think it's all starting to  blend together.  And every damn time, Danny Zuko would cave in to male peer  pressure and act like a phony to Olivia Newton-John.  One of the high  points of this movie was in the drive-in theatre when Danny elbowed Olivia  in the arm.  I forget how Miss Hannigan and her brother Rooster fit into  all this.	5.0	Love and pain in a drive-in movie	2000-02-09	2	1	1

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	ADRIENNE MILLER	"Grease is the coolest musical I have ever seen. John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John were the ""thing"" back in the 1970s. Grease has great songs, fabulous choreography, and solid acting. My favorite songs are Summer Nights, Hopelessy Devoted to you, and You're the one that I want. I seen this movie about a million times, never gets old and boring. Defintely get this movie on widescreen, looks better.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3QCYYGURVRKV7	Amazon Customer	I just got my Grease DVD today and I love it!  I'm watching it for the second time today as I write this review.  The widescreen edition is wonderful.  Now you can see all of the dancing and scenery as you watch this classic.  And the picture is wonderful too.  The images are so crisp/sharp and and the colors are so vibrant, you'd swear this movie was just filmed yesterday instead of over 20 years ago.  I can't belive it's been that long!  The sound is amazing especially when hooked up to a great system and the extras are nice.  However, there weren't that many extras on this DVD as I thought there would be. I'd hoped for more such as a commentary, behind the scenes, bloopers, deleted scenes or even cast bios. But who knows, maybe in the future there will be a platinum release or something.  Oh!  And the songbook that comes with it is great.  Reading it as I sang along helped me realize that I didn't know the songs as well as I'd thought I did.  I recommend this DVD for any Grease buff.  You won't be disappointed.	5.0	Grease on DVD is Great!!!	2002-09-25	0	0	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A9EB08OALOZJ8	Amazon Customer	This is an old favorite and for those who like musicals ... or dancing .. or remember in part the 50's ... it's a great glimpse into the past.  The actors are younger (we remember them as we remember ourselves) younger, more agile, a bity nutty and it's all reflected here.My kids enjoy the movie as well - it has a bit of something for everyone.  High school for most of us was a terrifying place and Grease manages to show the lighter - and sometimes the heavier side.  Its a bit flip about many of the issues -- but its a musical remember, and so it gets 4 rather than 5 stars..	4.0	Dancing dancing dancing	2013-10-21	0	0	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1IKOYZVFHO1XP	andy8047	"""'Grease' is the word that you heard,it's got a groove,it's got a meaning."",sings Frankie Valli in the theme song penned by ex-Bee Gee Barry Gibb. I can't tell you how many times in 26 years I saw this film. The first two times I saw it were in 1978,the year it was released. I was obsessed with this film then(I was then 6,nearly 7 years old). I went through 2 LP copies of the soundtrack and don't have either one anymore. A female friend and I would pretend to be Sandy Dombrowski and Danny Zuko,the star characters respectively portrayed by Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta. This film was based on the broadway play of the same title. The play debuted in 1972 and the film was made 5 years later. In the film,set in 1959,Sandy and Danny began their romance before returning for their senior year at Rydell High School. Sandy tells her girlfriends and Danny tells his buddies in song,entitled SUMMER NIGHTS. Sandy and her girlfriends are the Pink Ladies and Danny and his buddies are the T-Birds. Memorable scenes include Danny and Sandy at a drive-in theater,newly reconciled and temporarily parted due to an argument(Travolta sings SANDY). Also Danny and Cha-Cha(sexy and beautiful Annette Charles Cardona) strutting their stuff at a dance in the school gymnasium(that made Sandy jealous). Sha-Na-Na as Johnny Casino & The Gamblers performing at the dance. Frenchy(Didi Conn) being visited by a guardian angel(Frankie Avalon singing BEAUTY SCHOOL DROPOUT). Danny and Kenickie(pre-Taxi Jeff Conaway) racing in their cars. And of course,the Rydell High seniors singing WE GO TOGETHER at the carnival in the last scene. The late Eve Arden is the Rydell High principal,Sid Caesar is the phys. ed. instructor and Stockard Channing is Rizzo,Kenickie's girlfriend. This was one of '78's biggest films. Another film with a pop music soundtrack released the same year was AMERICAN HOT WAX which was a disappointment. This film was a hit largely because Travolta was still a teen idol and ONJ was a big-selling music artist. Travolta had a prior hit,SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER which grossed just as much as this film. Travolta's ABC sitcom Welcome Back,Kotter was still on the air at the time of filming but his role of Vinnie Barbarino was greatly reduced. After SNF,he wanted to focus on his film career. ONJ later starred in 1980's XANADU,a musical also. Travolta and ONJ re-teamed for 1983's TWO OF A KIND which flopped. Director Randal Kleiser subequently directed 1980's THE BLUE LAGOON starring Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins. This film was re-released theatrically in 1998,in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of its original release. The re-release featured previously unseen footage. It also gave those born after 1978 a chance to see it in theatres."	5.0	"""Grease"" is the word!"	2004-06-06	3	3	0

It has indeed stood the test of times, and is one of the few films the 1970s' that has been embraced by younger crowds. With its wonderful cast and classic songs, ""Grease"" is a classic.John Travolta is fantastic as Danny Zuko, the leader of the Greasers, the cool guys of Rydell High. Over the summer, he hooks up with Sandy, a plain jain who wins Zuko's heart..for now. Faith, however has other plans. It turns out that Sandy has enrolled at Rydell High. There, Sandy is looking forward to seeing Danny again. However, she is turned off by his school personality. She is also hated by the Pink Ladies, led by tough girl Rizzo (Stockard Channing). However, Danny soon realizes that he has feelings for Sandy, and tries to impress her. Sandy finally gives him a second chance. For a while, the two seem to be going great. But things soon go wrong, and the two break up.Things wrap up pretty predictably, but overall the film is fantastic.Everything about this film is nearly flawless. I'm at a loss for words.

While I look at it now and realize there were parts that were not appropriate for someone my age, it definitely went over my head then and I was clueless. But my best friend and I had the LP ( yea I'm that old) with The sound track, and we knew each song by heart.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AMICVV9N2U2R4	Atli Hafsteinsson	"Gosh, what can you say about Grease? It's fun, full of spirit and personality. This is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings. This homage to the 50s (homage, not representation) follows the lives of Sandy and Danny during a year at the fictional Rydell High. They fell in love over the summer, and now find themselves in the same high school. Can they overcome the roles they adopt to save their love?Even though there's a distinct 70s charm to the movie, you truly believe in the 50s atmosphere it has. That it's 1950s USA, and no other place or time. The plot of the film may not have that much going for it in the originality department but it's the personality about the movie that makes it such a joy to watch every time.Indeed, if you're looking for morals, well, you're not gonna find them here. Most of the characters are one-dimensional and many are often than not quite unlikeable (take all the T-Birds). The moral of the movie is quite bad as well; give in to peer pressure and you'll win the man of your dreams. Sandy, girl, you were fine just the way you were. True, she chose to undergo her makeover on her own accord, but all the same, it implies that being innocent and upright is a no-no. My favourite character is Rizzo, the most three-dimensional of the bunch. She acts tough on the outside, but has a tangible vulnerability that she tries to hide. ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"" reveals her character in a way that her interaction with her friends doesn't show; she almost upstages Newton-John with this riveting number.Of course, none of this would matter without the music! This is what makes the film so much fun. This movie is chock-full of songs that you just want to get up and dance to, feel sad to, reflect to. Mostly get up and dance to, though. One of my favourite scenes is the dance in the high school gym; a more fun dance extravaganza has hardly ever been caught on film. Just try and sit still when watching. You just want to enter the screen and join in. It's incredible.Okay, it has a pretty bad moral. Yes, the characters don't remotely look like they are really teenagers. But what the hell, I love Grease. It's one of those films that I think every man and woman should see at least once in their life."	4.0	A Feel-Good Hit that Just Loses Some Points for Bad Moral	2009-03-25	2	2	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1CZAMELERRIKR	"Barbra Madejczyk ""state theatre qualifier"""	"For anybody who wants to know what their grandparents (or great-grandparents) did for fun in boring old public high school, watch this film. It was already a period piece when it came out in the late 1970's, and watching it again made me realize how much the life of young people in the United States has changed, and yes, still stayed the same. Based on the hit Broadway musical of the same name, Grease is the story of a group of teenaged friends during their senior year at a California high school; girls yearn after boys, boys look their coolest best to impress the girls, hot rods are super fast (kinda) and there's plenty of jitterbug dancing and rock 'n roll music to fuel it along. Sandy and Danny meet during the summer, part company then find out she's transferred to his school. Shall he admit his love or impress the guys with his machoness? Kinnikie and Rizzo have a hot date ""parking"". Is she pregnant? The whole school thinks so the next day. Frenchie drops out of school to be a beautician. Is it the right move? The rival gang challenges our heros to a race for ""pinks"". (If you've seen the Fast and Furious movies you know what that is, but I bet some of you didn't know that practice was so OLD.) Can this stuff possibly be entertaining? YES. It's not the situations but the carefree, fun cast that make this movie fun to watch, and turned it into a classic. John Travolta as Danny is young, sexy, and can he dance. He's a fine actor, and plays the role with just the right tounge-in-cheek seriousness. Olivia Newton-John is beautiful as Sandy, and what a set of pipes. The hit ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" was written expecially for her to perform in this film, it was not part of the Broadway score. Also written just for her was the great finisher, ""You're The One That I Want"". I've seen the original Broadway musical and there was a lot more great rock 'n roll sounding songs and more dance numbers, but the humor and personality of the characters make this film move. Those of us who watched prime time TV in the 1950's will love the cameos by period TV stars in roles as teachers, principals, angels and DJ's."	4.0	High School Fun in the Fabulous '50's	2012-06-26	0	0	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ	"Barry ""Barrybgb"""	"Grease is an interesting thing. It's one of those movies that stays with you and goes wherever you go. Watching it again or hearing any of the songs on the radio is like opening up your own high school yearbook. A trip back through time. A reunion with friends you feel like you know, or could have known. It's a special thing indeed. The movie, as I'm sure everyone knows, was based on a musical. It was made into this film and was released in 1978. The movie became the highest grossing musical in box office history. Rightfully so. The movies takes place in California in the 1950's. Just as Amazon said, this nostalgia was running rampant in the 1970's. We first meet Danny Zuko and Sandy(John Travolta and Olivia Newton - John) having a romantic time on the beach. It all seemed so perfect. We jump right to the beginning of a new school year. Students are coming to Rydell High for the first day of school. Young, beautiful Sandy is coming for the first time. She immediatley meets and befriends pink haired Frenchie(Didi Conn), and her clique of friends known as the Pink Ladies, headed by Rizzo(Stockard Channing). Rizzo is a tough, feisty thing, and Channing gives the role her all in a great and memorable performance. Sandy runs into her summer love, Danny. Danny is the leader of the cool gang in school known as The T Birds. The rest of the movie is pretty much the love and attraction between the two and how Danny tries to regain his cool and not seem like a whipped, lovestruck little puppy. What makes the movie great and undeniably cool and enjoyable is how it is shamelessly great, cool, and enjoyable. Does that make any sense?. It's a bright, colorful, popcorn movie that wants nothing but to be a good, fun movie. It achieves that goal on every level. While the movie is looked on quite fondly by people and lots of younger kids as a nice movie, you really have to look deeper and pay more attention to certain dialogue and lyrics to see how the movie was actually kinda nasty in some ways. I'm sure there are things that would get edited out if I printed them, so I won't. Be on the lookout if you haven't noticed it already. The supporting cast is chock full of memorable faces. Comedy legend Sid Caesar is the gym teacher; Eve Arden is the principal; Lorenzo Lamas is the jock; Eternal nerd Eddie Deezen as, well, the nerd. And, of course, the cameo by Frankie Avalon. The music. I've saved the best for last. The music in this film is pure kitsch, but a lot of it is actually solid songs. With a movie this campy and fun, you can't really expect the songs to be different. It's just that kind of a movie. Olivia Newton - John could sing from the telephone book and I wouldn't care. She has such a lovely, warm, and beautiful voice, she make anything sound good. Who can deny the pleasures of ""Greased Lightning"", ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"", ""Your The One That I Want"", ""Summer Lovin"", and, of course, ""Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee""?. Pure pop done at it's very best. The writing is corny and sometimes cheesey, but guess what?. That's the movie. That's the era it's in. It isn't meant to be anything else. It is what it is supposed to be, and does it very well. The actors are all great. All well suited for their roles. Was John Travolta any cooler?. Olivia is a sight of pure loveliness. If you ask me, she looks even better today at the age of 54. Just gets better with age. Grease isn't a film that is going to be seen as Oscar material(the songs yes), and it wasn't meant to be. It has survived for the last 24 years because it's a good movie that can reach anyone in any age group or race. It's a film that takes place in a certain time, but the legacy will live on for all times. Grease is the word."	4.0	Hickey From Kenickie....	2002-09-28	6	6	0

Shirley ""Barry 1965"""	Well, like many of you I have waited a long time for &quot;Grease&quot; to be released on DVD and letterboxed to boot!  Although I only viewed this disc once...upon watching it I had the full 5.1 surround going on, I noticed that in some sections of the film the sound would drop off and in some places it sounded muffled.  How sad.  Now, this can probably be explained away in many ways, but I know that my surround system is fine and my DVD player is working great so you can elminate those options.  I have DVDs of foreign B-horror movies that sound better than this.  Could it be the disc? Maybe?  But I've never bought one yet with this problem and I have 280.  Could it be Paramount yet again doing a lack luster job in their production.  They've put so many of their movies out on DVD that aren't 5.1, maybe they really don't know how to encode their films into 5.1 or don't care if they do it properly.  There could be many reasons why this happened, but it is a sight for sore eyes to see Grease with a least a decent anamorphic transfer and on a disc that I won't wear out from too many viewings.  Now, let's hope this doesn't happen to Flashdance.	5.0	Movie 5 stars; DVD 2 stars	2002-09-28	3	3	0

The leather jacket slipcase is awesome, the new special features are great, but nevertheless I am reselling my copy (having only seen it once) because I cannot stand this new, remastered soundtrack.This seems to be a new trend with some studios, where they make a new soundtrack that makes the film completely unwatchable. If I have to stay with VHS or Laserdisc to have Grease with its original soundtrack, then so be it. But I will be damned if I sit through an American cinematic classic listening to this awful, echoey, added sound garbage Paramount wants to call ""remastered"".Shame on everyone involved with the release of this DVD.

But just like now, people got into the current ""IT"" film, so of Course Grease became ""The Word"". But come on, I thought those stupid Doo-Wopp songs were really annoying then... and I Sure don't dig'em any better now!  I didn't grow up in the 50's, but I kinda get the feeling that it was nothing like what they portrayed it to be in this movie.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3MGJVPJBNPSEJ	Blahblahblah	"I am in complete and utter awe of this movie.  I don't believe there is any other film in history that has matched Grease's ability to mess around with its audience's expectations and perceptions.  So many people finish watching this film feeling like they have just gone through a very cheerful and life-affirming experience.  But look at the film's actual plots!1. (The main storyline): Olivia Newton John learns that in order to become popular in highschool and win back the love of the man she had a summer fling with, she must make it obvious to the whole school that she is willing to put out.  Until she does this, John Travolta risks being ostracized and ridiculed by his male friends for dating a woman for purely emotional reasons. Since Travolta is the one that she wants, O.N.J. decides she must cater to his needs and very publically presents herself in her new role as a leather-clad boytoy at a fair (I still can't decide if this storyline is more insulting to males or females); and2. (the main subplot) A girl who gets pregnant because she has unprotected sex in the back seat of a car with one of Travolta's friends (she apparently learned earlier than O.N.J. how to be popular) has to choose between dropping out of school and getting a job (by way of graduating beauty school) so she can take care of her baby, or, alternatively, have an abortion so she can return to highschool.  Meanwhile, the boyfriend who dumped her after she got pregnant is one of guys accusing Travolta of a lapse in judgement for falling in love with O.N.J.Oh yeah.  And there's a dance contest!  (Perhaps if Scorcese had added a hand-jiving scene to ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" he could have avoided the whole controversy.)But because this extremely cynical story is set to catchy bubble-gum music and is filled with colourful images of a 1950s America that has never existed anywhere outside of theme diners of the 1980s, almost everyone misses the point! As a result, this film is widely loved, even by people who would ordinarily refuse to consider going to a depressing, sexist or ""morally questionable"" movie.  Which all goes to prove that in order to have a hit movie, sometimes all that is necessary is an easily forgettable plot wrapped up in distracting spectacle!However, as cynical and unrealistic as Grease may be, it is a fun exploitation film. But it only gets 3 stars because there are many juvenile delinquency films which were actually made in the 1950s that are far superior.  Sure, they're not much more realistic, but they're entertaining, not because of their insincerity, but because they try so hard to be sincere."	3.0	Commercial Exploitation Film	2002-10-13	18	5	13

I love this movie and have watched it a million times. I never get tired of it. Olivia-Newton John is so beautiful and she played the part of Sandy perfectly. I also love Stockard Channing and her role as Rizzo was perfect. I have the Soundtrack from this movie and have listened to it so much. One of my favorite(among many) songs is ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"" and Olivia has such a beautiful voice. If I was to rate this movie from 1 to 10, I would give it a 20!!!

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AWMXF7FDATJC1	Bradley D. Percell	What a great movie.  Ordinarily, I can't tolerate musicals.  There's something about the way that people are just standing there talking and  then all of a sudden break into song.  It's laughable under most  circumstances.  Grease breaks that mold a little bit.  All the musical  numbers-and there are some great ones-never interfere with the flow of the  movie and that's one of the reasons I like this movie so much.  Of course,  having Olivia Newton-John in tight black leather pants at the end doesn't  hurt.  This movie portrays high school life like we would all like it to  be-a special time in our lives that's filled with lots of fun with our  friends, nothing gets taken too seriously, and everything works out in the  end.  I'm reviewing the widescreen version because it, like so many other  movies, is much more impressive in its original state.  I know some people  don't like the little black bands on the top and bottom of their T.V.  screens, but look at it this way-you will be watching it in the way that  the makers of the movie always intended it to be.	5.0	High School Was Never Like This!	2000-08-13	2	1	1

Of course, the really big scene that  stands out in my mind is when Olivia walks up in the skin tight black  jeans.  What a knockout.  The first type of video player I ever owned was  the old SelectaVision videodisks that were popular in the early eighties  and Grease was one of the first movies I ever owned.  I've probably never  watched-with the exception of Star Wars-a movie as many times as I've  watched Grease. I'm guessing that I've probably watched it about 50 to 60  times all the way through.

The chemistry between Olivia and John Trovolta is electric. Aside from the music, which is some of the best around, the acting is very well done.The story of innocent Sandy and Danny who is bound by the image his 'friends' have of him is the same as has played out in high schools throughout the years.Innocent girl, who's very innocence almost gets in the way of a wonderful relationship.And Danny. A street tough(well sort of) who must maintain the bad guy persona for his friends, and almost loses Sandy because of it.Grease is a story of how these two individuals overcome what society believes them to be to become what they want to be.

Let me first start out by saying how much I love this all time classic, absolutely no dispute about that.  But I'm afraid the DVD is an almost unbelievably poor transfer - from virtually the first second you will notice huge levels of grain on the picture.  For me it's just too distracting and made me eject the disc within the first five minutes.  The 5.1 soundtrack, what I heard of it, was OK - but again it didn't have the punch I was expecting.  I guess for movie like this I was expecting Paramount to pull out all the stops, this HAS NOT happened.  I'll stick with my old LaserDisc, very, very disappointing.	1.0	Classic Movie - DVD ...	2002-09-28	5	2	3
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1PJZKEZQGREDY	California Dreaming	"I saw Gabe Kaplan about 10 years ago in a comedy club in Seattle; I believe that it was ""Giggles.""  I think at the time, he was on sabbatical from playing professional poker or something.  But during his act, from what I remember, he hinted that he wasn't the biggest fan of John Travolta.  At the time I was somewhat surprised, but thinking about it, it shouldn't have been too surprising, really, as the two were co-stars in ""Welcome Back Kotter"" at the time.""Saturday Night Fever"" released, making Mr. Travolta a mega-star.  But then, just within the next year or two, ""Grease"" released, and it could only have compounded his stardom.  He was very young, probably in his early-to-mid 20s at that time, and surely while he was more than excited about it, more than likely it gave him a big ego.  (That was what Mr. Kaplan seemed to allude to in his act.)  Hey, it probably happens to anyone at that age that has that level of success, so quickly.  But then of course, ""Urban Cowboy"" released later, and that was a really entertaining film as well.  More success, more than likely.I've been hit-and-miss on Mr. Travolta over the years; I think a lot of the movies that he's made over the last decade have been more than forgettable.  But he sure had magic when he was young, and in ""Grease,"" I actually think that he out sang Olivia Newton John a bit, and she was a very nice singer.  He just had that edge that you're looking for, especially for the 50s genre, and his falsetto on a couple of tunes was fantastic.  And of course, he's always been a very nice actor as well.  But overall, he's probably the most talented as a dancer.  Seems like he's a jack-of-all-trades-master-of-some.I finally watched this movie last night in HD 16 x 9, in it's unedited entirety.  Free HBO will do that for you.  And while this film is surely not perfect, it is perfectly fun, kind of like the film ""Abba"" in a way but surely better.  This is the only way to watch this film.  I saw a bit on ""Siskel and Ebert"" a long time ago where they were discussing cropping in film, showing what happens -- in a negative way -- when film is cropped from 16 x 9 to 4 x 3 for TV (they don't do this much anymore with the advent of HD, thank God).  But I was reminded of that episode while watching; catch a couple of scenes where you know if it were cropped it just wouldn't work as the background characters would be gone, and their expressions would be missed.To Mr. Kaplan I say, ""If I read what you meant correctly, I can understand it.""  But to Mr. Travolta I say, ""If you did have a big ego, I can understand it.""  After all, in the late 70s, Mr. Travolta was almost as big as Al Pacino."	5.0	You're the one that I want	2013-03-31	0	0	0

Luster ""The Rook"""	It doesn't matter if you are a fan of musicals or not, you will have fun with this 1950s High School movie complete with Hot Rod race made in 1978. I don't think it could be cast any better. John Travolta as a loner that has the bad boy look but isn't so bad he mistreats others. Olivia Newton John as the preppy that develops an interest in that bad boy and metamorphs herself. Stockard Channing as a bad girl leading a pink lady gang that looks for trouble and stirs the pot. They all do great jobs along with the rest the cast. The cast, directing, choreography, sets, and music are remarkable compared to other musicals. I highly recommend this one.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1AVC79SISIA7W	Camila Braune	Never in my life will I say that Grease is the best musical I have ever watched to, but it is really cool. I think it is famous just for the great music that it has, because the end of the film is obvious, everybody who saw it knows that in the end Danny will be with Sandy. The actors are not so good either, but they can sing very well and dance too. The plot portrays the life style of teenagers that have a free life, without trouble like school or parents, just doing things that the society thinks that are wrong. On the other hand, everybody knows Grease, it is a classic, ask your parents and friends, everybody knows that wonderful film.	4.0	Tell me more, tell me more	2003-12-03	3	3	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2GLN2XGQ5JNWQ	Carol Abbott	"My DVD collection is small but very select. Grease was one movie I knew I needed to own.  This anniversary edition DVD is great because of the cast interviews AND there is even a little song book included so you can sing along to some of the best music that will bring back the feeling of the 50s and early 60s.It is a little hard to believe that it's been more than 20 years since it first came out until you look at the actors! Travolta and Newton-John look SO YOUNG! But this movie still gets to me every time I watch it. There are great songs (Greased Lightnin', Summer Nights, You're the One that I Want) and memorable performances (Stockard Channing as Rizzo is a classic!).The story brings back a time when teens were ""boys and girls"", not very sophisticated in the ways of the big bad world. It evokes a little bit of the feel of my teen years and those are the clothes (poodle skirts, petticoats, bobby socks and saddle shoes) that I remember. Sure, sexuality simmered just under the surface, but there were more 'Sandra Dees' than there were 'Cha Chas' and the Rebels didn't run the schools and dictate the tastelessness that seems to rule today. Underwear was worn under outerwear and the most anyone saw was a droopy bra strap.The story is sweet, simple and classical. Boy meets Girl, they fall in love, there is a bumpy patch and then Everyone lives happily ever after. In ""Grease"" getting to The End is lots of fun! There are songs for every occasion and some of the most energetic and exciting dance sequences in a contemporary movie. John Travolta is wonderful as Danny Zucko and Olivia Newton-John makes a perfect Sandy.I always have a great time when I see this movie. I bet you will, too."	5.0	Just about the Best Movie I own....	2003-01-02	16	15	1

There are two people in this world, the kind that love musicals and the kind that dont. Within those groups are the people that love Grease or Hate it, the ones that hate it should stear clear of me because at any moment i might just bust out with ""summer nights"" or ""hopelessly devoted"" I have to admit that i always thought Olivia Newton John looked to old to be in high school, and her ""danny"" when she sees him in the parking lot after the game is hilarious. I was always in love with Kinicke not Danny, and I always wanted to be Rizzo not Sandy. My favorite song is ""beauty school dropout"" which is strange because its such a random point in the whole film, but i have many a times with my hairbrush belted out this song. The only song i dont like is ""blue moon"" its boring and ""Tears on my Pillow"" other than that its flawless."	5.0	As Perfect as Olivias Bottom in those pants.	2005-12-02	1	0	1
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2XCXRPM447Y07	Cathy Tiffany	A great fun family movie - even though I watched this as a kid a MILLION times, I'm actually shocked at how much sexual nuances there are - some not so subtle. All the sexual things (save one backseat scene and one drive-in scene) are words only, so little kids won't get it, but older ones have heard far worse (sadly).  All in all, a fun time.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AGOTQ7VEQ5IML	"cdkscully ""cdkscully"""	Grease was the first film that I saw more than once in the theatre (6 times to be exact) in 1978.  It was the largest running musical in theatre history and the film was closely based on the 1972 musical play.  The film featured a '50s theme, cashing in on the nostalgia craze that was going on at that time, containing the fashions, the music and the fads of that era plus [desire] overtones expressed by the teenagers.The story revolves around the seniors of Rydell High School and tells of their boy-girl problems, their lack of interest in School, the importance of having a fast car, the loud chaos of dances, pep rallies and the end of the year carnival.  This film really gave me a false perception of what high school should be.  It shows high school to be fun and games and glamorous.  I was disappointed when I began attending high school and realized that it was not was it was like in the movies. :)Produced by Robert Stigwood (of Saturday Night Fever, Tommy and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band fame) the film featured humorous songs ('Beauty School Dropout'), '50s era inspired music ('Born to Hand Jive'), and songs that were also popular during that era ('Hound Dog' and 'Blue Moon').  Some songs had also been featured in the Broadway musical ('Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee' and 'Summer Nights') and some were written specifically for his movie ('Grease' and 'Hopelessly Devoted to You')...There are two highpoints in the film.  The first once occurs at midpoint in the movie, when Rydell High is featured on National Bandstand and the whole school is dancing to 'Rock and Roll is Here to Stay' and 'Born to Hand Jive.'  The other is when the end of the school year carnival occurs where everybody sings and dances to 'We Go Together.'  These two scenes feature large production numbers involving the entire cast and solo dancing featuring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John...While watching Grease, I found the film to be lively and uplifting that helped people relive the '50s all over again and those who never lived in the '50s wished they had.  Photography, editing and the ages of the cast was completely overlooked once I became engrossed in the plot and the music.The film was a hit not because the film company said it was good.  It was a hit because it appealed to the public, adults and teens and it was a timeless film that will be enjoyed by the public for years to come.	5.0	Hopelessly Devoted to this movie!	2002-03-14	5	3	2
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1SBX1WFOY7AMF	Cecilia Monks	"Of course I had seen this movie previously, but I had a chance to watch it again with my children! What a wonderful way to give them a fun glimpse of a more innocent era. The students at ""Rydell"" had peer pressure, and reputations to protect just like the students today, but fortunately a kind of innocence still existed. I had a chance to point out that the kids smoked,and did things that are now unacceptable, but on the other hand still felt fear of punishment from their principal and had a healthy respect for her. The kids cared about their reputations, but ultimately decided to achieve some of their own individual goals whether it was lettering in track, building a dream car or making the wrong choice, like Beauty School, only to reevaluate and make the mature choice to go back to school and graduate. Not everything in the movie reflected good judgement, but there were real teaching moments in an overall very light hearted manner of delivery.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A24F1UX8ZT5IXY	C.J. Hustwick	I don't know if there is enough talent in the whole of Hollywood right now, in 2004, to produce a film that could sustain this level of energy. And that, I suppose, is what the film is all about -- from the ridiculous comic-book credits which have as little to do with the 50s as the spandex pants and Revlon make-up. My personal feeling, when watching this, was that no studio corporation would be daring enough to go for so such a freeform, expressionistic kind of film like this. And what irony too, because Grease itself is about a bygone era! I mean is it just me people?! As for the film, nearly all of the music numbers are top-notch, the story is thin but fun enough --my only complaint is that after the dance-a-thon it derails. Not that big of a deal -- but the beginning of the film has such promise. Travolta singing about sexual frustration with the hot dog animation in the background is a high point.	5.0	If this came out today....	2004-09-20	5	4	1

We used to listen to it all the time when his mother was taking us places. After being sold on the great music, I finally saw it on TV one time. I was hooked. The music is great, and the story fits the music. I own this movie on laser disc, and can't wait to get a copy on DVD as well.Between the wonderful title song written by the Bee Gees, and a great job by Olivia Newton-John on her songs, the music alone makes this a wonderful movie. It is icing on the cake to have wonderful choreography and acting as well. Stockard Channing makes a great Rizzo, and even Frankie Avalon makes an appearance as the Teen Angel.	5.0	Grease is the word	2002-05-08	0	0	0

Though the actors are a bit old to play high school kids, they can do it very well.  The music is so original and  awesome, and the non-stop comedy is great!  To enjoy Grease the best, I  recommend buying the 20th Aniversary Edition, and if you can't, that's ok,  you'll like it just as much.  I have never seen the Broadway version or any  play version, but this version is really great!  Watch it right away.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2P49WD75WHAG5	Daniel J. Hamlow	"I went to see the 20th anniversary of Grease when it hit the theatres.  I enjoyed it thoroughly, love at first sight!  OK, confession time:  it was also the first time I'd seen it.  Yes, a Gen-X'er like me not seeing Grease is like a Gen-Y'er not seeing American Pie.  However, blame my parents for banning much popular culture during my formative years.The opening scenes of Danny and Sandy carousing and clowning around on the beach ends appropriately, when Danny tells Sandy, ""Of course not, it's only the beginning,"" and then come those crazy animated credits and Frankie Valli singing the immortal title track.There's Danny Zucco and the T-Birds, his inseparable best friend Kenickie, and the ""three stooges,"" Sonny, Doody, and Putzie.  Sandy is befriended by Frenchie, whose compatriots, the Pink Ladies, are Marty, Jan, and the sarcastic Rizzo.  Basically, we see this story from their point of view.  After all, they are the more interesting characters and make no effort to conform, remaining in their clique groups.It's more than just Danny and Sandy finding each other's true selves at school, but that of the T-Birds and Pink Ladies, who discover that things aren't always cut in black and white, but have a way of working out in the end.  All the actors make their characters come alive, love or not love them so much.  And everyone has a favorite few characters that they grow up liking with each viewing.  Mine are Danny, Sandy, Coach Calhoun, and Frenchie.What are the highlights and familiar scenes at high school?  Bonfire night, going to Lover's Lane, hanging out at the diner, the big dance, the drive-in, graduation carnival, it's all here, a 1950's time capsule that was made in 1978. Well, some of these might be passe, but of the traditions that still exist, I was alienated in all these things during my three year sentence.  Maybe because this movie makes it so ideal and magical, and that it's set in 1959.Of the adults, hats off to Eve Arden, the strict but benevolent school principle, except she plays Miss McGee, not Miss Brooks.  And Sid Caesar makes Coach Calhoun a really well-rounded character--patient, kind, helpful, and full of spirit.One interesting subliminal message I noticed from go was the animated cartoons playing at the drive-in screen while Danny is singing ""Sandy.""  As he's winding up his song, notice the antics of the hot dog and the hot dog bun.Outdated themes:  the 50's cars, gas guzzlers and now a threat to the environment, the fashions of course, but also actors in their mid-to-late twenties playing high schoolers.  Heck, Stockard Channing (Rizzo) was in her thirties in 1978!There's magic in this movie as well.  As soon as Frenchy wishes she had a guardian angel a la Tammy And The Bachelor, Frankie Avalon appears and the Frosty Palace comes lit with the ""Beauty School Dropout"" number.  And the ""Greased Lightning"" fantasy number, where Kenickie's beat-up car is transformed into a hot rod with slick paint job, chrome wheels, white-wall tires, and, the most important item of all (ha ha), furry dice, shows Travolta really enjoying himself.Of the musical numbers, ""Summer Nights,"" ""Greased Lightning,"" all of the prom songs, and the celebratory ""We Go Together"" are unforgettable wonders, but the cherry on the icing is the ""Born To Hand Jive"" number, where the dance floor comes alive, topping the ""Rock 'N' Roll Is Here To Stay"" number in energy.This is definitely the last great musical to come out of Hollywood, and remember, Grease is STILL the word!"	5.0	Grease is STILL the word!	2002-07-26	5	3	2

""Grease"" is the very definition of a good time at the movies: light-weight story buoyed by terrific songs and energetic performances.  It may not hold up to critical analysis as well as many other films, but I can't deny that production numbers such as ""Summer Nights"" and ""Sandy"" make me unreasonably happy.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A16J0W1ZX2KX8P	"""david_from_nyc"""	One of my favorites from my youth is finally out on DVD, and while it is a real pleasure to see it with the new medium's visual clarity, I have to wonder who's dumb idea it was to add so much reverb to every musical number that the characters sound like they're singing in the Holland Tunnel.  There's no such reverb on the cast recording - WHY was it deemed necessary for the DVD?  It was only by accident that I discovered that by switching off the VSS mode on my DVD player, the reverb would shut up and I could actually enjoy the musical numbers.  If you're having the same problem, try altering your VSS setting.  Other than that (and seconding everyone else's reservations regarding the DVD's near total lack of special features - for this flick, I would have liked to have seen a sing-along, bouncing-ball version... or even a karaoke track) it's still a great flick.	3.0	Great Flick - Lousy DVD	2002-12-08	3	3	0

When I first took a look at the widescreen dvd version I was blown away. I was seeing actors in scenes that weren't there before! It looked absolutely beautiful, it was breathtaking. It sounds great, looks great, and IS just spectacular still 24 years later. My only problem with this release is a few special features. We get a featurette with most of the actors talking about the film and a trailer but that's about it. I was hoping for some deleted scenes or outtakes and a commentary. I did love the booklet with all the song lyrics, that was so cool. Overall I am happy with this dvd mainly because it was so long in the waiting and it just looks so well done and everytime I view I remember why it such an important piece of the 1970s.	5.0	Grease is STILL the word!	2002-12-22	4	3	1

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1HCHCL86MKX3G	Dean Glass	"I won't go into the plot here, because, let's face it, if you haven't seen Grease by now, you probably won't ever see it.  And you are missing out on a really fun film.  That is the secret to this movie's popularity.  It's just plain fun!  It doesn't have a really great script, none of the performancies (with the exception of Stockard Channing) is anything above run-of-the-mill, but it's got a lot of great, catchy songs, a very likeable cast, and is just a treat to watch again and again.  I was disappointed by this DVD release though, because it's exactly the same as the laser disc, only smaller and you don't have to turn it over.  The cast interviews at the end are four years old, and this is really just a delayed release of the 20th Anniversary Edition on DVD.  And what fan of Grease needs a cheap, paper booklet of song lyrics?  Believe me, we know them all by heart.  Truly the most profitable and one of the most popular musicals ever made deserves a better DVD package.  The fans certainly deserve it too, having waited so long for this.  Boo! to Paramount for, apparently, wanting to wait and pick our pockets again some time down the road when they release the two-disc set with all the extras this movie should have.  At least it's in widescreen, which is a totally different viewing experience for anyone who hasn't seen it letterboxed or on the big screen yet.  The musical numbers have a much larger scope, with dancers and other action on the sides that had previously been cut off.  You will be surprised how many previously unseen guys are on the bleachers with Danny and the gang for ""Summer Nights"".  And to anyone who is planning to buy the full-frame DVD--shame on you!  You are truly missing out."	4.0	5 Star Movie Lowered (Slightly) By Disappointing DVD	2002-10-01	8	8	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AOYTQFRLD8VLP	Deborah Earle	"I well remember the publicity surrounding the premiere of this musical in 1978. As my parents thought I was too young to see it when it first debuted, I wouldn't see it in its entirety until three years after its release, but after I acquired a copy of the soundtrack, I became one of the cool kids at my Elementary School because I was one of two girls who could bring it to be played in my home room class just before the weekends---wonderful days!I also remember the commentary of a few classmates who did see it;namely, ""'Grease' was stupid!"" -- a sentiment I have come to appreciate as I got older because it advocates the idea that a nice girl should give in to the peer pressure of the less desireable element in order to keep her boyfriend.Still, it's never a dull flick to watch.On the 40th anniversary of the debut of the original(and reportedly racier) Broadway version of this story, I dedicate this editorial toast to Jim Jacobs, Warren Casey's and Bronte Woodward's highly significant pop cultural work, here directed by Randal Kleiser and  produced by Alan Carr.We follow young Australian student, Sandy Olsen ( Olivia-Newton John in her definitive role) and her romance with Danny Zuko( John Travolta) on the California Coast sometime in the late 50s. Amid strains of an instrumental version of ""Love is a Many-Splendored Thing"", we see two sweet teenagers frolic on the beach, and then lament Sandy's impending departure to her native Australia.Then, amid the dynamic contemporary sound of the title song, sung by Frankie Valli, and cute cartoon graphics that give viewers an edification of the trends of the 50s,the first day at Rydell High School begins, where we meet the principals in this drama, including tough but vulnerable Betty Rizzo(Stockard Channing), greasers Kenickie( Jeff Conaway), Doody, (Barry Pearl), Sonny (Michael Tucci), and Putzie(Kelly Ward),who comprise the T-Birds, and their female counterparts the Pink Ladies , including the amiable beauty-school student Frenchy (Didi Conn),big-haired Marty Maraschino(Dinah Manoff), and Jan ( Jamie Donnelly).Principal McGee,( Eve Arden) proves herself perfectly capable of holding her own against the resident rowdies, although the nerdy Eugene Felnic(Eddie Deezen) has no such luck.McGee's secretary Blanche( Dody Goodman) has a few issues of incompetency,Alice Ghostley's Mrs. Murdock is the shop teacher with a pivotal role in the story.As Sandy befriends Frenchy and the other girls, Danny's High School alter ego-- a leather jacket-wearing cigarette smoking gang member is revealed.Susan Buckner's high achiever, Patty Simcox proves to be an annoyance for the Pink Ladies during lunch hour, but she invites Sandy to join the cheerleading squad and  Sandy and Danny give differing versions of their summer romance in the song ""Summer Nights"".At an evening bonfire and pep rally, Principal McGee and Coach Calhoun(Sid Caesar) give comically pathetic speeches in an attempt to rally the football players to a long-elusive victory.Aware of the truth about Danny after Sandy reveals the name of her summer paramour, The Pink Ladies reunite her with Danny, who in the company of his gang members has to remain cool and aloof in front of a ""chick"" and therefore represses his excitement at their unexpected reunion, hurting Sandy.A sleepover at Frenchy's house reveals Rizzo's obvious resentment for the well-brought-up Sandy after Frenchy botches her attempt to pierce Sandy's ears.But Marty tries unsuccessfully to help Sandy overcome her heartache by writing to any of her varied swains in other places.The song ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" expresses Sandy's feelings.Rizzo gets bored and leaves the slumber party to go off with they guys when they show up. Tensions increase when Kenickie kicks the others out of his car to be alone with Rizzo, but that encounter will have potentially  dire consequences for Rizzo later on.Sandy starts dating football player Tom Chisolm(Lorenzo Lamas, portraying life in the decade in which his parents were at the height of their fame), and at the local malt shop where screen veteran Joan Blondell as waitress, Vi, serves up the shakes and presides over a thousand adolescent dramas,Danny apologizes to Sandy for his previous behavior, but when he criticizes the accomplished athlete she is dating, she challenges him to see how well he'd fare as an athlete, a challenge Danny accepts.In the meantime Frenchy fails beauty school, ending up with pink hair due to a tinting class snafu. Vi is ill prepared to advise her on what to do next. Frankie Avalon's Teen Angel steps in to do that the in number, ""Beauty School Drop-Out"".Coach Calhoun presides over a comical episode in which Danny tries to find a suitable sport to impress Sandy, but his streetwise persona hinders his ability to get along with others in contact sports.So he ends up as a cross country runner.The story could have ended happily right there, with a street kid trying to be something more, but alas it doesn't.Amid a lively soundtrack, we follow the gang through the National Bandstand Dance, held in the school gym , and presided over by DJ Vince Fontaine( Ed Byrnes), who tries to seduce Marty. Johnny Casino and the Gamblers(Sha-Na-Na) perform as a fight between Kenickie and the leader of the Rival Gang The Scorprions, Crater Face(Dennis Stewart) breaks out on the dance floor as Rizzo, his disgusted date, leaves, the gang reunite Danny with former girlfriend Cha-Cha Di Gregorio( Annette Charles), and rig the dance contest so they end up together, pushing Sandy out of the way, and Putzi, Sonny, and Doody moon the camera on national televison, but manage to avoid trouble.During a night at the drive-in, Rizzo has a pregnancy scare that becomes the talk of the campus. Sandy's reunion with Danny is brief, due to his attempt to come on too strong, The era of guys trying to get reputations and girls trying not to makes itself felt in that scene.Overshadowing the greasers' lives is the upcoming auto race with the Scorpions. A calamity will alter the course of that event unexpectedly.The year-end school carnival is a joyous romp, with loose-ends tied up ,Sandy having made a crucial life decision(for which any girl's parents could disown her) two more great musical numbers, and  the glorious sense that youth may have that come what may they'd always be together.One can faintly hope that Sandy will somehow end up as a more positive influence on her greaser guy. But at least for the moment, they remain the coolest couple, and audiences will be satisfied with that.Whatever the future may hold, the youthful spirit of this story endures."	4.0	"Disquieting as Its Message May Be, Spirited ""Grease"" is Still the Word!"	2012-06-07	2	1	1

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2FRKEXDXDN1KI	Dennis A. Amith (kndy)	"""GREASE"" is the most successful movie musical ever created.  The 1978 film was based on a musical by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey and eventually caught the attention in the early 70's of producer Allan Carr who purchase the rights to adapt the play into a film.With the popularity of ""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"" in 1977 which help boost the career of John Travolta, producer Robert Stigwood joined Allan Carr to create a film based on this play.  Tapping director Randal Kleiser who worked with Travolta in the popular 1976 TV film ""The Boy and his Bubble"", recruiting ""GREASE"" musical choreographer Patricia Birch and hiring Director of Photography Bill Butler (""Jaws"", ""Stripes"" and ""Rocky II & III"", etc.), this team would create a film that would become a musical ingrained into American pop culture.Despite no respect in supporting the film by the major film studios, ""GREASE"" would become the second highest grossing film in 1978 behind ""Superman"" bringing in $96 million in the box office, the ""GREASE"" soundtrack would achieve #1 status around the world during its release and the film received many award nominations.VIDEO & AUDIO:""GREASE"" is featured in 1080p High Definition and I will tell you I was blown away by the picture quality.I've watched this film dozens of times, owned the VHS and both DVD versions and when I started watching the High Definition Blu-ray transfer, I was speechless.  The many colors featured in the film were quite vibrant.  This film is over 30-years-old and Paramount really did a great service in the transfer and remaster of this film.  Closeups, outdoor scenes, you name it, the film looks spectacular!I compared my 25th Anniversary DVD to this Blu-ray and just the opening sequence alone with the two at the beach, the colors are just absolutely stunning on Blu-ray.  I was literally in awe of how beautiful this film looked in High Definition.  The DVD video quality just doesn't compare to the Blu-ray disc and I was quite impressed!As for audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD and also in French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish mono.  Since music is a big part of the film, it was important for me to test this Blu-ray out on my system.  Where the 1977 film ""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"" was just spectacular for its High Definition audio transfer, I was hoping to have an awesome lossless soundtrack for ""GREASE"".Somehow, in the beginning of the film, it seemed as if the audio coming from the center channel was a bit lower than my front speakers. So, dialogue seemed as if it was being overpowered by the music.  I've run a variety of tests and I did have to increase my center channel dB a little bit to compensate for the music coming louder but this may be due to my audio setup for my receiver.  But everything sounded well throughout the film after the adjustment.The dialogue was quite clear but the music really came alive and I did notice certain sounds utilizing my subwoofer during the car and music scenes.  But overall, the music does sound great and clear via Dolby TrueHD 5.1.SPECIAL FEATURES:""GREASE"" comes with a good number of special features.  Included on this Blu-ray disc are:* Commentary: Commentary by Director Randal Kleiser and choreographer Patricia Birch - This commentary is quite interesting as Kleiser talked more about the film side of ""GREASE"" while Patricia Birch talked about the choreography part of the film.  Both give really good insight of bringing the musical to film, talking about the things they had to accomplish and how Kleiser, Birch and DoP Butler really had to work closely with each other and the talent to make this film successful. You learn about the challenge of filming the National Bandstand segment, the finale during 102 degree weather and how Olivia Newton-John had to have her tight clothing sewn on and more.* Introduction by Randal Kleiser - A brief :24 second introduction to the special features.  Kleiser does several introductions throughout various features.* Rydell Sing-Along - This segment is for those who want to watch the musical parts from the film and on the bottom of the screen is a karaoke single along.* Featurette: The Time, The Place, The Motion: Remembering Grease - (22:27) This is the main featurette featuring interviews with the Director, producers, the cast sharing their memories of working on the film, working with John Travolta and more.  How Allan Carr and Robert Sigwood made this musical a film and put money into it despite no studio wanting to back it, having to work with a good number of talents, John Travolta talking about why he wanted Olivia Newton-John to play the role, how Jeff Conaway actually played Danny in Broadway and was understudy for several other roles with the exception of Kinickie.  And many more interesting tidbits on the making of the film.* Additional Scenes: Deleted/Extended/Alternate Scenes with introduction by Randal Kleiser (intro :13 scenes 11:55 - TRT 12:08) - Randal Kleiser explains how footage was recently found in the Paramount vaults.

But I have to be truthful and say how much I was in awe to see the brilliant camerawork but to see how the choreography and just literally everything look quite smooth on film.And surprisingly watching this again 30-years-later and as the Director and even producers have said in the featurette, they were able to pull things off today that probably wouldn't happen now.  Quite a bit of sexual lingo but overall, the lyrics of the songs to the mannerisms of the characters is what made things look genuine.It's interesting to read some of the critical reviews from people who did not grow up with the film but are more familiar with today's musicals and drawing comparisons to ""High School Musical"" and making the comment of how HSM utilized real teenagers for high school life and that ""GREASE"" utilized 20 to 30-something year olds to play teenagers.  I don't think any of us who watched it back then ever thought about the age being an issue for the film.  What we saw were popular talent at that time in a movie musical and the film became a success.  Even today, I have no reservations of the talents playing their roles.  They did a fantastic job!For me, John Travolta was the hottest star coming off with ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" and then doing ""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"" in 1977 and Olivia Newton-John was just one of the most beautiful female solo singers at the time.  Both had unique chemistry and the film was well-cast that I felt everything just went smoothly on the final cut.You really have to give a big applause to Allan Carr and Robert Stigwood for taking the chance of bringing a musical to film but making sure its adapted well for the screen.  Sure we see musicals now but during that time, there was no studio support.  And because the film was enjoyed by audiences, the film is definitely ingrained into America's pop culture.Also, I was just amazed through the featurettes and learning how the choreography was done.  Because there were so many people utilized in the dancing segments, Patricia Birchwood wanted to make things come alive but to alter a talent's own personal dance to make it look right on film.  And of course, Bill Butler, to capture what Birchwood wanted on film, the amount of cutting from scene to scene showing opposing points of view on a song like ""Summer Nights"" to the ending theme, it was indeed ""electrifying""!Overall, this Blu-ray release of ""GREASE"" is just the definitive version to own. To watch this classic film in High Definition and to see the magnificent picture quality really brings out the vibrant colors of the film, the energy and beauty of the beach sunset to showcasing the life of youth of the late 50's.  The DolbyTrueHD 5.1 audio makes the music come alive and last, there are many special features included that will help people remember and celebrate such a wonderful movie musical.Again, this is the true definitive version of ""GREASE"" to own!  I was just stunned by how magnificent this film looked and how much clearer and alive the music sounded in High Definition.  I highly recommend this release!"	5.0	"Blu-ray: ""GREASE"" looks absolutely gorgeous in High Definition!  Highly recommended!"	2009-05-06	84	77	7

Well wade no more, buy this one for your Kindle and wow - great sound and great video, no problems. Mind you, I have a Fire HD so I cannot speak for a regular Kindle but I see no reason why it wold not be the same quality. As for the film itself, its a classic and if you grew up with it you will love it. If you like musicals you will love it, if you fit neither category, run for the hills you will hate it.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A29COAL60SB48B	Donna Di Giacomo	"Let's face it: The 1950's were the most boring time in America (besides the 40's).  It was all about conformity - from the cookie-cutter suburban monstrosities called houses to the goofy clothing, to the music (I have more respect for Buddy Holly, who wrote his own music, as opposed to Elvis Presley) and toeing the right-wing line.  It was a decade when discrimination ran rampant against anyone not white or male (or who didn't fit into and buy the so-called ""American Dream"") and careers continued to be ruined by the witch-hunts of so-called ""reds.""But . . .I actually enjoyed ""Grease"" when I sat down to really watch and digest it.  John Travolta's time on Broadway with this show really paid off in the lead role.  He simply took it and ran with it.  No other actor could take his place as Danny (although didn't he ever get tired of playing the stereotypical dumb Italian guy - even though he's only half-Italian?).  Olivia Newtown-John was tailor-made for her role as Sandy.  She is one of a handful of singers who could actually act.  She was super cute.The DVD extras were informative and added to the good-time feel of the movie.  Apparently, the cast and crew got along so well that, for many of the cast, it really felt like their senior year in high school.  That chemistry came through in the movie and is still apparent nearly 30 years later.I can actually say I enjoyed the movie and the soundtrack.  It's just one of those movies you can never tire of after watching many times.  There is no logical explanation as to why there was a sequel."	4.0	Enjoyable, despite being based on the 1950's	2005-11-13	4	1	3

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A29VKODW4R5U7W	dooby	"I won't go into praising the movie. It's already an American Classic and obviously anyone who's contemplating buying this will already love it. I felt guilty about double-dipping but the cute leather jacket was an irresistable gimmick. The following discusses mainly technical aspects of the new disc.I did a one-to-one comparison with the older disc. The picture has been cleaned up and looks noticeably different, though not necessarily better. The tiny dirt specks and film nicks, few as they were on the first disc, have been almost entirely eliminated. There is less grain. The picture also looks brighter, due to application of higher contrast. This has both positive and negative effects. In the darker scenes; like ONJ's ""Hopelessly Devoted to You,"" the greater contrast (deeper black levels and brighter highlights) makes it appear clearer, and I personally prefer it this way. Some viewers may not like it as the lighting now appears harder and more ""artificial"". In other places, the greater contrast tends to wipe out detail in the brighter parts of the picture; you can see this at the opening beach sequence, where the scene now appears brighter and clearer but the finer detail in the sandstone rocks have been obliterated in the glare. So pluses and minuses, but overall I liked the new transfer.The audio too has been remastered. The bass here is noticeably more prominent than on the previous DVD. It has that very satisfying visceral feel to it but there is also swamping of the underlying instrumentation. However I doubt if many people would notice or bother. What reviewers have referred to as an echoey quality on the first remix is still there. It is actually an over exaggerated reverb added to the vocal track. Most of the tracks in Grease have electronic reverb applied but some are more obvious and artifical than others; especially so in the 1998 remix featured here. The most egregious examples would be at the ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" reprise and Travolta's ""Electrifyin'"" repeats in ""You're The One That I Want."" Again I liked the newer, audio remix, mainly for its richer bass extension. Like previous reviewers have said, the 2.0 Stereo featured here is not the original theatrical Stereo mix but a downmix of the later DD 5.1 remix (made in 1998 for its 20th Anniversary re-release). And purists should note that the DD 5.1 remix (1998) is actually messing about with the music itself - there are additional instrumental and vocal overlays not found on the original theatrical soundtrack. (Eg. additional bass drum in second half of ""Summer Nights,"" background vocals in ""Hopelessly Devoted to You,"" and a clap-track in ""We Go Together."") Perhaps someday the producers will see fit to release Grease with its original unembellished soundtrack.The real delight here are the Extras. My favourite is the 15-minute long ""25th Anniversary DVD Launch Party."" Exerpts from the party concert include full length versions of Olivia Newton John singing ""Hopelessly Devoted to You,"" Olivia and John Travolta singing ""You're The One That I Want,"" and the reassembled cast singing ""Summer Nights."" All fine performances packed with fun-filled nostalgia. The 11 deleted/extended scenes are all in B&W; and last for just 10 minutes. Nothing earth-shattering here but good to have all the same. The Sing-Along was something I appreciated. In the previous DVD, there was no direct access to individual songs. A note about the Sing-Along subtitles. These are multicoloured, animated, karaoke-style, lyrics that accompany the songs and can be activated within the film or in a separate Sing-Along session. It apparently caused problems for some viewers. I tried it out on several DVD players, a Sony, a Pioneer and a Denon, one of which was over 5 years old. The lyrics displayed without any problem. It also worked on a computer DVD-ROM drive (Pioneer), so at least these models apparently work. Only the main feature is anamorphic (enhanced for widescreen TV - 2.35:1 OAR). All the extras are in standard 1.33:1 fullscreen."	4.0	Fine new Rydell Edition... Remastered Video & Audio... Delightful Extras	2006-10-07	337	330	7
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2BEU7GPGNIG44	Dorrie Wheeler	"The movie Grease has appeared on DVD several times. The most current incarnation of Grease on DVD is the ""Grease Rockin' Rydell Edition."" This edition of Grease is truly for the superfan or the person who hasn't previously purchased the movie on DVD in the past.Grease is the cult classic that starred Olivia Newton John and John Travolta. Olivia Newton John starred as Sandy. Sandy was a transfer student to Rydell High working to fit in John Travolta stars as Danny. Danny and Sandy had a wonderful summer romance but when Sandy transfers to Rydell their two different worlds collide. The films soundtrack--and dance numbers are classic.So what makes this version of Grease on DVD different than the version's previously released? The DVD comes in a leather jacket type of keepsake case. This is cute and the box fits snugly inside of the jacket. What really makes this version of Grease on DVD stand out are the bonus features. The film recently celebrated it's 25th Anniversary. The DVD includes memorable scenes from the 25th Anniversary DVD party. Another neat bonus feature is the featurette ""Grease Memories"" from John and Olivia. There are a ton of bonus features including a Rydell sing-a-long, deleted scenes, a featurette named the moves behind the music and many more.I recommend Grease-Rockin' Rydell Edition for the super Greast fan. If you already own the film on DVD and only are interested in the movie it's no need to repurchase the movie. If you are planning to purchase Grease on DVD for the first time I would strongly recommend this edition of the film on DVD."	5.0	If You Are A Superfan or Someone Buying For 1st Time Get Rydell Edition	2006-09-19	39	37	2

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1E6JS6C205VZD	Dr. Laurence Raw	There are some films that are quite simply critic-proof: GREASE is one of these.  Forget the flat filming style (by Randal Kleiser) and the fact that the Rydale High students seem way too mature - we should just sit back and enjoy the songs, color, movement and sheer energy of the film.  John Travolta's Danny is both arrogant yet touching; someone willing to show bravado in front of his male buddies, yet extremely weak when it comes to showing off his emotions.  His body movements are a joy to watch - especially during the sequence where he presents Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) with a cheap ring and asks her to marry him.  Newton-John is especially good as a Doris Day/ Sandra Dee-type figure who cannot quite understand why Danny should behave so differently in front of his buddies. Stockard Channing's Rizzo quite simply steals the show; she cultivates a hard-boiled exterior (her real name in the film is Betty), yet cannot cover up an essential vulnerability, especially when she thinks that she is pregnant.  GREASE also contains a clutch of memorable cameos from television and film old-timers, from Sid Caesar's Coach Calhoun to Eve Arden's Principal McGee, to Joan Blondell's Vi.  In short, there is something in this film for absolutely everyone, regardless of their age and/or cinematic tastes.	4.0	A Film You Can Watch Again and Again	2013-08-27	0	0	0

But if you are going to roll out yet another attempt to repackage our beloved classic, make it worth rolling out the bucks. How about this: offer a re-release with the (!!!!!!!) ORIGINAL THEATRICAL AUDIO TRACK as an option. We love the remastered print, etc. But some of us really long for the original track, especially because some of the classic songs were over-remixed in the 1998 re-release. The biggest disappointment is not being able to hear the movie the way many of us first experienced it in 1978. (No disrespect to composer John Farrar, but) I miss watching ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" without the unnecessary - and sometimes distractingly over-mixed - backing vocals, for example.Many classics that were remastered or recut offer us fans the option of seeing them in its original form (see Superman: The Movie or ET: The Extra-Terrestrial) in addition to the revamped versions.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A84Z6XUMGRMJ1	Duane Thomas	Grease was director Randal Kleiser's first wide-screen movie project - before that he'd done a lot of TV work. He says in the Making Of feature that when he first looked through the monitor, while shooting this film, and saw that wide movie-type frame versus the narrow TV box he was used to, he knew he'd hit the big time. And he made wonderful use of that wide frame. Especially in the dance numbers like &quot;Summer Nights, &quot;Greased Lightning,&quot; and &quot;You're the One That I Want,&quot; the action spreads from one side of the screen to the other. Grease is severely lessened when shown on the full-screen instead of being letterboxed. Take it from someone foolish enough to buy the wrong version. A Grease that only gives you two-thirds of the dance numbers is a crippled thing. Go for the wide-screen version and get the full treatment.	4.0	Do NOT Buy the Full-Screen Version of This Movie	2004-06-11	8	8	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AMA9QL8HT8GS3	"""eastercrow"""	I got this for my wife and she had two of her girlfriends over and they all sang along watching it. No big surprise there. The VHS comes with a dance re-mix CD with a picture of JT and ONJ on it and the script and lyrics in a booklet. They're pretty cool for goodies in a VHS. There is also something extra as part of the program but my wife fast-forwarded past it, so I don't know what it is. Maybe interviews, maybe &quot;Making of&quot;, I dunno but it should be at the end of the program -- like on my collector's &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;. I guess they wanted it to be a &quot;teaser&quot; but it's more like a &quot;spoiler&quot;. This tape isn't letterboxed, but that seems to be a plus for some people. Ok, I won't say anything, I know you think you're missing part of the show on the pan and scan... I won't say anything. This is a good gift to get someone who likes 'Grease' and anyone that likes it loves it, so you can't go wrong.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A13E0ARAXI6KJW	Ed Uyeshima	"It's hard to think of a bigger slice of 1970's Hollywood kitsch than this candy-coated, mega-successful 1978 musical comedy. Capitalizing on the tidal wave of Eisenhower-era nostalgia pervasive on both big and small screens at the time, it manages to be stridently artificial and mindlessly entertaining at the same time, although it still boggles the mind that it has had such an afterlife, including sing-along versions playing at art-house movie theaters. Part of the ironic amusement is watching actors obviously in their late twenties and early thirties pretending to be teenagers. Credit should be given to director Randal Kleiser for his unapologetic stance on maneuvering the contrived silliness with spirit if not much finesse.Set in a period of the 1950's that existed only in Hollywood and lacking any semblance of reality or dramatic conflict, the threadbare plot focuses on greaser Danny, the cool leader of the T-Birds, and wholesome Sandy, a good-girl Aussie blonde enjoying a summer romance on the beach prior to senior year at Rydell High. Sandy was supposed to move back to Australia, but she ends up staying stateside and attending Rydell. With image being of the utmost importance, Danny initially rejects Sandy - now a cheerleader - when they meet again, and we follow all their romantic complications over the course of the school year until graduation. There is also the ongoing power struggle between the T-Birds and the rival gang, the Scorpions, as well as the peer-pressure shenanigans caused by the T-Birds' girlfriends, the Pink Ladies, headed by sleep-around tart, Rizzo.All of this merely provides an excuse for the various musical numbers, the most energetic being the ensemble pieces like the cleverly edited ""Summer Nights"" and the stylized ""Jailhouse Rock"" knock-off, ""Greased Lightning"". Most of the numbers are from the Broadway show, though there are some deliberately anachronistic insertions such as Barry Gibb's disco-accented title tune and the peppy funhouse duet, ""You're the One That I Want"". John Travolta is perfectly cast as Danny, even if his singing voice threatens to evaporate from his sincerity. Olivia Newton-John has the right manner and looks for Sandy, though she is hardly challenged to develop a compelling character here.The standout is Stockard Channing as Rizzo, the only character that has any connection to the reality of the times, and she expertly sings the mocking ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" and frankly outdoes Newton-John on the touching ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"". Several familiar faces fill out the cast - Eve Arden in Miss Brooks mode as Principal McGee, Sid Caesar rather constrained as Coach Calhoun, Joan Blondell equally pallid as malt shop waitress Vi, Edd Byrnes as a Dick Clark-type lothario, Alice Ghostley as the auto shop teacher, Dody Goodman as the ditzy school administrator, and of course, Frankie Avalon serenading ""Beauty School Dropout"" to squeaky-voiced Didi Conn's Frenchy.Serious examination of the film is useless since it is more a cheery variety show with superficial references to the sexual politics of the 1950's. The new 2006 ""Rockin' Rydell Edition"" DVD package comes with extras that should satisfy fans. There is an insightful commentary track by Kleiser and choreographer Patricia Birch; eleven minutes worth of deleted scenes in black-and-white; a nostalgic ""Grease Day"" featurette that contains interviews with Travolta, Newton-John and producers Allen Carr and Robert Stigwood; and coverage of the 25th Anniversary DVD launch party, which includes spirited performances by Newton-John, Travolta and the remaining cast."	3.0	Nostalgic Nostalgia Fest Maintains Its Superficial Bounce	2006-12-17	9	7	2

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A15TNUM2PBS6F0	"Ei ""crzybookmoovielover"""	"Grease has that very typical story line that many musicals have:boy loses girl, boy gets girl back, loses girl again, does something radically different to get her,and then gets her back.Olivia Newton John is Sandy, and John Travolta is Danny..the boy and girl of the story.It's one my favorite movies of all time. A lot of the reviews here are very negative.  Some stating that the film has far too much sexual innuendo, and some people just go way into detail..While Grease may have some sexual innuendo,(i didn't really know what that was at 9 when i first saw it), it may have people in it who are clearly not teenagers, but adults playing teenagers..but come on' fellow ... This is Grease we are talking about!!! It's a musical! It's certainly not made for children under the age of 9, but if kids younger than that are watching, I don't think they even notice that..it goes right over their heads while they sing and dance along with all the fun songs that grace the entire movie's soundtrack.I think many of the reviewers here have taken Grease to seriously..It's one thing not to like this movie, which I know plenty of people who do...and that's fine...I will always love this movie.  I did at 9 years old when it came out..and I still love it now, 24 years later.  It is just pure fun to watch even if some of the characters do seem annoying at times(the t-birds), danny and kenickie are the t birds..the other guys are just three stooges rip offs.I did like all of the pink ladies, and I think the best acting done was my the leader herself, Rizzo, played by the wonderfully talented actress, Stockard Channing.  John Travolta, Danny, who is charming, often looks bored and not happy to be in this movie, but I still love watching him careen across the floor during ""Greased Lightening"".  This is a movie that I can watch over and over.  Every time it comes on cable, I have to watch at least half of it. This movie has always been so entertaining for me and so fun to watch.  It's an ""escape"" from all the serious films.This is a movie worth watching for fans of musicals, fans of Stockard Channing, Olivia Newton JOhn, or John Travolta, or just for people who like to have fun and be entertained in a very simplistic way.(Warning: you may start singing along as they break into song!)And it's got a good ending..."	5.0	One of my all time favorite movies	2002-01-05	2	1	1

I made sure it wasn't my DVD as I ran many others to check it.  The sound for the talking scenes were fine, but the musical singing and dancing scenes had terrible audio.

But it shouldn't matter when it comes to entertainment, as long as the film doesn't insult your intelligence.  I remember first seeing this movie when I had just turned 13  and will remember the feeling as long as I live.  Grease is colorful,  glossy and sincere in it's satire.  And the chemistry between the very sexy  John Travolta and the ultimate beauty of Olivia Newton-John only happens a  handful of times every decade.  Paramount truly dropped the ball in 1998  when they O.K'd the rerelease for the late winter of that year and not wait  until the summer, I guarantee it would have made more money!  Grease is a  summer movie and will always hold a special place for people who were lucky  enough to see it in the theaters.	5.0	Most fun film ever made!	1999-12-23	4	3	1
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3VPPOQROZQRJ2	Gary Hunt	I was very disappointed in the process used to transfer to DVD.  The print that was transferred to the DVD appears to be somewhat faded and dirty.  However I was most disappointed with how grainy the movie is, I have seen movies that twice as old and older that had better transfers.  One other note; for some reason in all of the shots that were in the soda shop they having digitally blurred out the Coca-Cola logo in signs and menu boards.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A38EUJOKO2CYEV	George Stoll	"Well.... we all know the story. There have been specials on E! and VH1 as well as the original show from 1978 ""Grease Day USA."" BUT, what happened on this much awaited DVD? The menus are silent and motionless and the only extras are an edited version of what VH1 showed as well as the original trailer, which by the way, show two scenes on the beach that were deleted from the movie itself. I was hoping for a commentary, behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes.... But Paramount is not a fan based company. They just deliver products to be consumed and not enjoyed or treasured. HOWEVER, that said, the transfer is okay, falling just slightly below the laserdisc that was released earlier and with the same extras. The widescreen is great to have. And the sound is.... good, although the stereo separation is weak. I'd just wish for more. This being the first of a slew of releases from ..., I'm more likely to rent rather than buy the other releases."	3.0	Short of wonderful	2002-09-15	14	11	3

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2HWD9PTM7RBXN	G. J Wiener	Whereas this movie is not overly deep, it does deal with the fun times of high school.  Friendships and relationships are portrayed in a amusing manner.  John Travolta and Olivia Newton John fit their parts like a hand in a glove.  Thesongs seem to blend in nicely from scene to scene and the special effects of the day work real fine.  Especially like Frankie Avalon's moment in the spotlight.  The time period is a bit helter skelter it seems like the movie jumps from the beginning of the school year to the end in almost a heartbeat.  But that is not enough to flatten this effort.  It has a wide appeal so most audiences will enjoy it.	4.0	Light Hearted Fun	2001-02-05	4	1	3

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A33TRNCQK4IUO7	guillermoj	"1978's ""Grease"" was a cultural and critical success and it's not hard to see why. The Rockin' Rydell Edition is the only way to go as the colors have never looked more bright, the scenes are totally scratch-free and the digital soundtrack makes for a better experience than the original DVD. I'd buy it mostly for the first two reasonsand not for the latter as the sound clean-up is not is not as impressive as the look of the film.Seeing a movie like this so many years after it first came out reminded of why I liked it from the very first frame. The familiar boy meets girl tale is elevated to classic status due to the star appeal of its leads, the great casting of the supporting cast (particularly a long in the tooth Stockard Channing, but no one else could have played Rizzo), non-stop singing of beyond catchy songs, top-notch musical numbers, and even manages to sneak some old timers for fun.It's really a wealth of riches and one of my favorite musicals. If you are too young to have seen this when it first came out and think that the recent ""Hairspray"" was good, you may think that this is even better. For the others who missed it when it came out, it will make you yearn for the good old days even if you did not go to school in the late 1950s. While the movie was pre MTV and has none of the fast edits of say ""Flashdance"", the goes by so fast and leaves you wanting to see it again.The DVD extras are OK, esp. interviews but the alternate takes part is lame.

But seeing the movie as a child in the theater is much different than watching it as an adult.  The last time I watched it, the TV channel provided commentary on a crawl at the bottom of the screen, and the two crucial, gaping flaws with the movie finally crystallized.First, the age of the actors.  God bless `em, but they were WAY too old to be high schoolers.  Stockard Channing was 33, or nearly twice the age of her character.  Ms Newton-John was 29.  Now, I'm not asking for perfect verisimilitude in a movie, but you can't violate my willing suspension of disbelief so obviously.The second problem is the location of the school.  The T-Birds look like a classic Long Island / New Jersey type gang, similar to the Lords of Flatbush, complete with the accents.  But the school has palm trees waving in the background, and the final race, as almost anyone who has watched any movie made in America can tell you, takes place in the L.A. River basin.  It creates an inconsistent and inauthentic setting."	2.0	Second thoughts about being hopelessly devoted to Grease	2007-12-09	4	1	3

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AWJOPA63RZXFH	Jake10865	I was so looking forward to the release of Grease on DVD. Paramount certainly made us wait a long time for it but now that it's here I can't believe what shoddy treatment it has been given.Ok so it's an old movie. I expect to see some grain on the film and all in all, I personally am not that disappointed with the picture quality but it all could (and should) have been so much better.To start off with the packaging is a cardboard case that will fall to pieces long before the DVD does. There are no commentaries, no production notes, filmographies, cast/character bios, gallery, outtakes, etc etc. All we get is a static menu, the movie trailer and 20 minutes of interviews with the cast (that were recorded 4 years ago to celebrate the re-release of Grease for it's 20th anniversary in 1998). There is also a songbook for anyone who still does not know the songs after 24 years !There is a lot more material out there that could have been included - Maybe Paramount are working on a 25th anniversary release for next year and this was just the prototype !	2.0	DVD could (and should) have been better.	2002-09-26	2	0	2
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2XXOV7SN1FF7R	J. Aleman	"I am not into movie musicals, but this is one of my favorite movies.This movie is great becuase its a simple and fun movie to watch. You know it by heart, and can sing along to it.  I will definately be buying this DVD, especially since I have only seen the movie in TV pan/scan... I never got to see the rerelease in the theaters.  I am so glad that its going to be the 2.35 widescreen.  Please do not buy the Full Screen version, it just won't be the same.I really like the songs, both in English and the Spanish versions that came out for the Mexican version of it with Timbiriche a few years ago.  I actually saw that version in the theater !  Its called "" Vaselina "" in spanish.  Look it up on the web, there is a whole album with most of the songs.As for reviewer Robert A DelMedico (...rendition of a killer play), I doubt if anybody would disagree with him that the high schoolers looked too old.  But thats always a problem with kids/teens in any movie.  But he is looking at it from the point of the play.  Most people see the film as seperate from the play. They should not be judged against each other.I do agree with him about the missing songs/scenes.  When I saw the play in Spanish ( Vaselina ), some of the songs that he mentions missing where the most prominent in the play.  But that might have also been due to which were easier to translate.Buy this one !  But get the widescreen edition.  And don't buy Grease 2.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AHMRHGIWPMQPI	James D. Porter	Ive been a fan of this film since it came out back in 1978.  Its odd but its like the 70's version of the Wizard of Oz.  It appeals to all age groups and backgrounds.I dont know anyone who actually sat down and watched the film from start to finish who didnt like it.My first copy was on CED, the old RCA disc system from the early 80's that died within about 5 years.  It still plays by the way and the colors really popped on that transfer.  Next was on laserdisc, the Pioneer disc system that lasted into the mid 90's.  That copy was ok, but not as a good as the CED. Both of those transfers were cropped.Since DVD came along this is by far the best transfer!  The picture is smooth and the grain is gone thankfully.  The colors pop and the image is sharp.  I have a Sony lcd projection tv and Sony dvd player.  Ive not jumped into bluray yet if I ever do.Its taken about 30 years for a home copy of this movie to come along that has a decent transfer of the original film!	5.0	Big Transfer improvement over last one in 2002	2010-01-12	2	2	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1A535W556ROBQ	James Ferguson	Travolta is one of those rare leading men who outshines everyone around him.  Here he is at the peak of his sexual energy unleashing all the moves that made him such a big hit in the 70's.  Olivia Newton John looks pale by comparison, even though it was the height of her career as well.The movie bounces along on a fantastic soundtrack with wonderful sequences that leaving you smiling all the way through the movie.  Some memorable supporting roles such as Jeff Conaway (from Taxi), Stockard Channing, Joan Blondell, Alice Ghostly and many more, but Travolta remains front and center exhibiting a charm and vitality, tearing up the dancefloor when it comes time for him to do so.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A106016KSI0YQ	Jay Dickson	There's almost no one between the ages of 45 and 30 who can't sing all the words to &quot;Summer Days, Summer Nights,&quot; and that's probably the best testament to the enduring popularity of &quot;Grease,&quot; which was really the last successful movie musical in the great Hollywood tradition. The film was the most financially successful musical ever made, and when it was released it was almost impossible to go anywhere in America or Europe that summer without hearing the film's hits on the radio.The central casting was just about ideal, with John Travolta perfect for the narcissistic and endearingly dumb Danny Zuko and the pop singer Olivia Newton-John as the virginal Sandy Olsen (originally Sandy Dumbowski in the stage version, but they had to explain Newton-John's accent and made her, somewhat bizarrely, a visiting Australian exchange student). Newton-John is extremely likeable and enchantingly pretty (with her highly etched cheekbones and big wide eyes): it's a real shame she never had the film career she deserved, because she is exceptionally winning in this film. Her singing is lovely too, although her big number (&quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot;) was written by her usual songwriter John Farrar and doesn't sound like any other song in the film's score.The rest of the cast is fair to middling, with Eve Arden basically walking away with the rest of the film as an Our Miss Brooks-like principal. Didi Conn makes the only real favorable impression out of the actors attempting (largely unsuccessfully) to convince us that they're teenagers. Stockard Channing is far too old to play Rizzo (although she's quite fine in both of her big numbers), and most of the actors who play the T-Birds are fairly annoying--they seem to be Borscht Belt comedians on special loan to Rydell High (that must be some exchange program).The film is not without its puzzling points: you never seem to figure out why the televised national dance competition is being held with only the Rydell kids participating, or why the final song celebrates how much the characters like one another when they seemed largely unable to stand one another at all during the rest of the film. But its worth watching just for Travolta and Newton-John, and above all for the fine choreography (&quot;Summer Days, Summer Nights&quot; is a particular standout).	4.0	The last of the oldtime movie musicals	2001-03-18	14	11	3

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AWA0CA9AYL5YQ	Jennifer Litchfield	"Grease is everything a musical film should be.  It is a visual and aural feast that has captured the imaginations of audiences for over 25 years.  Everything is larger than life and the action occurs amidst a riot of 1950s colour.  Who cares if the cast is largely composed of 30-somethings playing teenagers?  The key to Grease's success is not realism, but the enormous amount of infectious energy exuded by the cast.This zest for life is particularly apparent in the lively and eminently sing-able chorus song-and-dance numbers.  The tunes of retro party favourites such as 'Greased Lightning' and 'You're The One That I Want' will probably be familiar to many viewers, but lesser known songs, including the short and sarcastic 'Look At Me I'm Sandra Dee' and 'Beauty School Drop-Out' (with Frankie Avalon in the role of guardian angel) are also fun toe-tappers.Musicals work best when, like Grease, they concentrate on the music rather than the plot; however, the story here is completely adequate.  Sandy and Danny had a summer fling at the beach, but at school Danny has an image to uphold - which Sandy doesn't really fit - so their senior year at Rydell High is spent in a daze of ""will-they-won't-they"" teenage angst.John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John set the screen alight as Danny and Sandy; there are some fabulous character roles in the ""Pink Ladies"" and ""T-Birds"" school cliques, and some very funny cameos - particularly the pairing of Principal McGee and Blanche the office lady.  There are sexual innuendoes aplenty if you look hard enough, and despite the fact that the movie is set half a century ago, the viewer is led to conclude that teenagers have been, and will always be, teenagers."	5.0	"""Conventionality belongs to yesterday"""	2003-02-11	2	2	0

The tragic tale of a sweet, young woman who is lead astray by the miscreants at her new school, ultimately turning into a bit of a tart. Until starting at her new school, Sandy was the sort of woman you'd be proud to introduce to your parents. However, after meeting some of the other students, including the morally corrupt ""Pink Ladies"", she is transformed into a more debased version of femininity. Some of her new behaviours include smoking, hanging out with hoons, and (cringe) singing in public. Realistically Grease 2 should have been about Sandy's future, not about motorcyclists."	1.0	One young lady's downward spiral	2013-11-03	9	3	6
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AZO8OJ7YGSJSS	"J. Jenkins ""Opinionated One!"""	"One of the worst stage shows ever remains one of the worst movie musicals of all time. Following the tradition of every desperate actor in showbiz, the film is miscast with a bunch of 30-somethings who should have played the parents. Travolta and Newton John lacked all chemistry and the remaining cast brought nothing to the picture. The only two good things about the film were the new songs added....and now every stage version features them, as if it's going to make you feel better about the travesty of seeing dimwitted adults try to recapture their youth. I saw this film when it came out and it just boggled my mind that adults would flock to a script so pandering. But then the stage show continues to horrify audience even in the 2000's and STILL the tradition carries on to cast 40-somethings as teenagers....only because people who are 60-something now go to see this show and overlook how bad the actors are because they can't actually see the stage performers up close! This is NOT a great movie musical and the film's message is ""ladies, sell yourself out to be a whore to get ahead."" But I guess there's truth to this....how else to explain Kim Kardashian and her family. Paris Hilton, and any of the REAL HOUSEWIVES."	1.0	Grease was really not the word....	2012-07-15	25	4	21

Yeah, yeah...Olivia was great singing by the pool and yes the song is great and all. But hey her acting chops arent' that great. Okay so she looked fantastic with the sandy 2 outfit. But Rizzo was actually the only character with some meat to it. Even though Stocard Channing was too old for the role she pulled it off and with so little to work with she actually makes the viewer care about her. While you forget the rest of the cast after the first ten minutes the movie is over. You kind of remember Rizzo. Maybe because she was the ho or maybe because...hey, she actually was the only who had to act in the entire movie. And that song &quot;There Are Worse Things I Could Do&quot;. That such a great song and the emotions she put into it and the feelings one gets just hearing her sing. It is actually the only song I remember. The rest just goes out the door once the movie is over. You have to admit it the next time you watch &quot;Grease&quot; that Rizzo is actually the best role in the film.	5.0	Stockard Channing?	2001-08-28	2	0	2

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	"A film by Randal KleiserDanny (John Travolta) and Sandy (Olivia Newton John) have a summertime romance in the late 50's, but it ends when the summer does and Sandy has to go back to Australia.  It is time for a new school year at Rydell High, and Danny is a Senior.  He is a member of the T-Birds gang (which feels like a more innocent version of what we'd think of as a gang), the leader of the group.  Sandy had told Danny that she had to go back to Australia, but she ends up starting school at Rydell also, unaware that Danny is there.  Danny is the cool greaser, popular with the ladies and with a reputation to uphold.  Sandy is the sweetest girl next door that you are ever likely to find.  When they meet up again, they are excited to see each other, but it doesn't work because Danny is hiding behind his reputation and behaves accordingly.As a musical, this film is absolutely wonderful.  It harkens back to a more innocent time, and while this film is a bit more sexual than you might expect from a PG rated movie, it is very sweet and charming.  Most of the songs are great, fit the scene and do not have that stereotypical ""it's time to burst into song"" feel.  The songs feel like a more natural extension of the character and scene and sometimes even feel like what they might actually say at that point.  Stockard Channing steals all of her scenes as Rizzo, the leader of the Pink Ladies.  Her two big songs ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" and ""There are Worse Things I Could Do"" are highlights of the movie, along with the classic ""Summer Nights"" (Travolta and Newton John), ""Beauty School Dropout"" (Frankie Avalon), and ""You're the One that I Want"" (Travolta, Newton John).  The one complaint that I do have is that I much prefer Sandy as the girl-next-door over her new look at the end of the film.  All the characters act like it is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but all that it is showing me is that Sandy has to change who she is in order to get a guy to like her.  Or, maybe I am thinking too much about this.  The bottom line is that this movie is a blast and it is my favorite musical.  ""Grease"" is one of my favorite movies and is a modern classic, even if it is a little campy.  I don't know how well it will age over the next twenty years, but for now: Grease is the word.-Joe Sherry"	5.0	Grease is the word	2004-06-04	3	3	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AD9WTAOAFUZA4	"Jose R. Perez ""Jose"""	"As far as film musicals are concerned, nothing comes close to ""Grease"" in terms of appealing to a mass audience of all ages, races, and generations.  Though set in the fifties, ""Grease"" remains deeply entrenched in the seventies, as it defined that freewheeling decade's carefree attitude and innocence while drawing inspiration from the Elvis era.  Still the top-grossing movie musical of all time, ""Grease"" works as a coming-of-age film we can all relate to - it sings (great songs from the Broadway classic plus chart-topping classics from the Bee Gees and Olivia Newton-John's longtime collaborator, John Farrar), it dances (Rydel High's Gym Dance),  zips (""the chicks'll cream for Greased Lightning"") and celebrates youth and friendship.Twenty five years after its first theatrical release, the movie still feels and sounds fresh even through its nostalgia, thanks to star-making performances from Travolta, Newton-John and Stockard Channing, to its clever wordplay and its irreverent look at high school - when everything and anything is possible.  It's a movie that gets better with repeat viewings, as audiences associate seeing it with a singular moment in time.  Cameo appearances from golden greats like Frankie Avalon (""Beauty School Dropout""), Sid Ceasar and Edd Byrnes are comic gems.The now-world-famous cast is hard to beat ... Didi Conn and Stockard Channing are excellent as Frenchy (THE beauty school dud) and Rizzo (the tough girl with a soft spot), while Eve Arden (Our Miss Brooks) gets the supporting role of a lifetime.  Dody Goodman as her daffy assistant is a hoot, but the film belongs to the music and the performances of its two principles.  Olivia Newton-John is a sublime choice for Sandy.  Though requiring re-tooling from the original stage show, her character's Aussie born lass is a perfect combination of girl-next-door sweetness and (later on) I-Am-Woman-hear-me-roar guts.  Perhaps no transformation has been so effectively cut in a movie as ONJ's good girl gone wild.  Besides setting off fashion trends and the lycra industry, Sandy's evolution reminds today's teens that you can be hip AND nice.  That's a testament to the singer-actress' presence in this film and her ongoing legend.  Travolta is also sublime as Danny, a mix of cocky swagger and silly-boy charm that's never malicious...just young.  His Danny plays both sides of the teen-angst fence, whether telling his version of ""Summer Nights"" to the boys, or sweetly professing his love for ""Sandy"" at the drive-in (drive-ins are set for a comeback if this DVD finds itself into everyone's home!)  After 25 years and countless viewings, Olivia and Travolta make beautiful music together!Guaranteed a winner in any home, ""Grease"" gets better with repeat viewings and remains accessible, fun and genuine.  As a backdrop for baby boomers' high school years and our memories of all thats happened since...""Grease"" remains the word!  Thrilled to have this out on DVD!!!"	5.0	A Musical for The Ages - Finally on DVD	2002-09-15	44	36	8
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1YTCTY24AOKMF	Josh Andrews	Probably the greatest musical of all time, Grease (starring Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta) shows us the fun of its generation.  With the acting, the story, and the flawless music featured in Grease, it's no wonder why it has gotten such critical acclaim.When Danny Zuko (Travolta) and Sandy Olsen (Newton-John) fall in love over the summer, Sandy delivers the news that she'd be leaving back to her home in Australia.  But as the new year at Rydell begins, Sandy has a change of plans and stays in the U.S.  Once re-united with Danny (thanks to Rizzo, played by Stockard Channing), Sandy is delighted to once again see Danny, and Danny is just as overwhelmed.  But he believes that his masculinity and his leadership is being questioned when he has trouble expressing his love for Sandy in front of the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies, so he decides to play it cool - which would end up in Sandy becoming confused and seeing Danny in a different way, yet she remains in love with him.  But eventually, things do work out between Sandy, Danny, the Pink Ladies, and the T-Birds - this movie is packed with great acting, not to mention the great songs featured in it.Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta shocked viewers everywhere when they broke out into song.  Catchy songs such as &quot;Greased Lightning&quot; (sung by John Travolta), &quot;Summer Nights&quot; (sung by Olivia and John), and &quot;You're The One That I Want&quot; (sung by Olivia and John) - which is the signature song of the movie, became instant national hits.  Olivia's solo song &quot;Hopelessly Devoted To You&quot; shows how much of an angel she is, pouring out her sweet voice to beautiful lyrics.This movie was well excecuted.  It's a legend of its own time.  This is a must-see, and of course, a must-have for any lover of great movies.	5.0	Grease -is- the word.	2003-06-05	0	0	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A13KXWTN0DT878	"Josh ""Josh"""	Finally, one of cinema's all-time favorite musicals has made it to DVD! Grease - a long awaited dvd release of mine -- holds that magic that makes a film a rounded complete cinema classic.Everyone knows the story of the Rydell High group, each going through their own little quirks and some getting share that through amazing song and wonderful dance. It's awesome how director Randal Kleiser combined the main plot of Danny and Sandy with subtle subplots such as Rizzo and Kenickie (Which - in a way - are the main stars of the Broadway version), the Thunder Road ordeal, and Frenchie's dropping out of school for beauty school. The cast is an awesome group of talent. Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta as our leads are captivating with the best moves and wonderful voices. Jeff Conaway and Stockard Channing add that sufficient racy attitude into the film with their smirky one-liners and great voices. The rest of the Thunderbirds and Pink Ladies were all great assets to the film and are memorable in their own way. Especially Didi Conn and her voice. Loved the lady.Although I praise the movie highly, the DVD is a the littlest bit of a disappointment. We do get the film in anamorphic widescreen and the nifty original theatrical trailer, but there's nothing new in regards to bonus features. We get the same interviews that can be found on the 20th Anniversary special VHS edition (Which aren't bad, but I've seen it so many times). But there's nothing more than that. Warner Bros. did treat us to a nifty packaging, but the menus aren't gawkable. All in all, the DVD presentation is a fair one.Grease is a piece of cinema classic fare if there ever was one. Disagree with me? It's okay. But I know me, a fan, and tons of others agree with that statement.	5.0	Cinema Classic, Yes!	2002-10-02	3	3	0
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A240QB45BSMDAN	Josh P.	Arguably, the best nostalgic musical. &quot;Grease&quot; finds John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John reunited in high school after a summer on the beach. They try to be like each other and impress each other in their own ways. John Travolta looks his best in this film. I think he WAS a natural-born greaser along with Henry Winkler. The movie does take you back in time to the '50s even though I wasn't born then, though from the movies I see, and the '50s music I hear, I don't doubt it. The movie was a 1978 box office hit. 20 years later, it was a hit all over again. Boy, I remember that! It was so popular again. I can't compare it to &quot;American Graffiti&quot; though. That's a classic that's just not appreciated enough by my generation. Getting back to &quot;Grease&quot;, if you like films of this genre, go for it, but don't go for &quot;Grease 2.&quot; It just doesn't cut it and was a flop. Greased lightning strikes once in the same place. It's right here!	5.0	&quot;Grease is the word!&quot;	2004-04-12	2	2	0

We had the volume turned all the way up and could barely hear the dialogue. Then when a song would come on the audio would boost back to normal and we would have to rush to turn the tv down. It got progressively worse throughout the movie. We have had similar experiences with other older movies that were put onto blu-ray but this was unwatchable.

Watching it again, I still find myself entertained by a simple story enhanced by catchy, memorable music, likeable characters, romantic chemistry and art direction. It doesn't matter what era the film is set in; it's timeless.For those who don't know, ""Grease"" is set in the 1950's at a California high school where Sandy has just moved to from Australia. She is reunited with her summer fling, Danny, and the two deal with their love amidst cliques, the prom, and their reputations. There's a reason why the film's popularity prevails after more than 20 years: it is a highly enjoyable movie. Marketing and hype cannot do that!"	5.0	Great For All Ages!	2002-07-09	2	2	0

I never seem to tire of watching it - with its' great cast, awesome music, and adorable story line, I don't know of anyone who doesn't like Grease!John Travolta & Olivia Newton John mesh perfectly in this 1950's romance film, and the rest of the cast is great as well.Grease is a musical about 2 late-teens who had fallen in love while on summer vacation.  They never thought they'd see eachother again, as they lived in different states.  But then, on the first day of school they see eachother - here her family had moved, but she never knew it was to HIS school district!These two are VERY different!  She is a shy, quiet, goody-t0-shoes, and he the tuff type.  Although they eventually try to make it work, these differences seem to be to much for them to overcome...So, will they get back together?  Will he change or will she?  I won't answer these questions, as I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't seen this movie yet.  Suffice it to say that this is an excellent love story, set in the 1950's, and with awesome music.	5.0	A Musical Classic	2005-08-21	27	16	11
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1W5472Y5KCVE5	katie senych	"The movie Grease is one of those movies that take everything you would want for senior year and put it one movie. You start with summer, finding that special someone and not wanting to leave unless it's with that person. School in the fall brings all the things you've been hoping for (Ex:""We're gonna rule the school"") and make it exciting. The time frame for the movie is perfect, nothing bad, it was a time that everyone got along and had fun, fashion took a huge step for the ""Pink Ladies"" with poodle skirts, and vintage clothes. The time was original, it brought the classic memories in the race under the bridge as Danny raced with scar face. Then in the end, the cards were put on the table that the group of friends really truly were friends forever.I highly recommend this movie, this is a definite movie to cozy up to when it's cold!!"	5.0	The Favorite movie that explained senior year	2002-02-26	2	1	1

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AO3WRA3YGZATB	"K. Crumley ""Author of the Daughters of Oberia..."	"Very cheesy & trite ""formula"" musical about a good girl who tries to fit in with the ""cool crowd"" that smokes, drinks, drag races and gets in fights.  Olivia Newton-John's vocals and Travolta's dancing are the saving grace in this film, as well as the endearing performance by Didi Conn as ""Frenchie.""But that's as good as it gets as far as casting; the rest of the actors are in no way believable as high school teenagers.  Poor Stockhard Channing looks miserable throughout the film, in a role that is clearly beneath her.  Somehow it lends to the perceived tough chick attitude of her character.To fans of the musical:  you'll be disappointed too, as so much of this has changed from the original to Highlight the talents of the actors of the time.  Even Travolta looks too old to play his role, and it is unbelievable that anybody knew how to disco in 1952.What is most disappointing is the message that ""too nicey-nice"" is a bad thing, and you have to change and be more ""morally gray"" to fit in....the music is pretty lame, but in a funny way."	2.0	Cheesy & overrated romp.	2010-08-10	11	4	7

I was 10 years old and in New York City on vacation with my uncle. It was opening day for Grease and we decided to go see it. I couldn't tell you what movie theatre it was in, but it was one of those old great movie theatres that actually had character: art decco decor, sticky floors, and the ghosts of generations of movie goers...I loved Grease (this from an avid hater of movie musicals: bad music and worse acting; give me a Shostakovich string quartet or a Mahler symphony any day!). Grease was magical to me: the music was fun fun fun, John Travolta was at his very best (when I'm 90 years old if you mention the name John Travolta I will always picture him as he was in Grease), and Olivia Newton-John was cute as pie. This from a kid who saw Star Wars the year before over 40 times in the movie theatre in 1977 (and lets not forget the Great  James Bond movie The Spy Who Loved Me and the awesome WWII movie A Bridge Too Far). I still have my record of the Grease Soundtrack I bought at the time (of course no turntable to play it on).I can say that I haven't seen Grease as many times as I have seen the original Star Wars movie, but I probably have seen it more times than any other movie besides Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark (okay I have seen the original Star Wars over 300 times and Raiders of the Lost Ark almost as much - not that we'll see those two movies on DVD before the next millenium). Grease is truly one of the purist movie experiences you'll ever have. Great music, and actors who are having fun and not taking everything too seriously.Pure fun. A classic movie made during the golden age of movies...the 70s silly!So nowadays you have the gaudy Moulin Rouge with a Jedi and Nicole Kidman making me cringe. I'll take the sweetness of Olivia Newton-John and the ""Welcome Back Kotter"" John Travolta every single time!"	5.0	A blast from the past!	2002-07-01	11	9	2

There, she runs into a guy she met in the summer, who is in a car gang that is against another car gang. Throughout the year, this girl ( her name is Sandy) and her friends deal with the guy(his name is Danny) and his friends. The movie pretty much told about the ""typical"" high scholl senior's problems, except in a more 60's background. The movie actually took place in the 70's. At the end, Danny's car gang beats the rival gang in a car race, and at the end of the movie, the whole gang of guys and girls gets back together without any problems at the end of the year.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1GFB47CXP4LKR	Kindle Customer	Firstly because it reminds me of a carefree and happy time in my life. I saw this in the summer of 1978 when I was 12 years old and the only thing I had to worry about was making sure I didn't have any overdue library books, keeping the lawn mowed and starting ninth grade in the fall. Secondly because there's some great pop music in this movie, _Hopelessy Devoted to You_ is one of the best pop songs about unrequited attraction ever written. Thirdly because of the subtext of this movie, the lesson this movie teaches you is that in order to get ahead you have to be a slut, just look at the way Olivia Newton John (who was 30 when this movie was made) turns from a good girl at the beginning of the movie into a leather trouser wearing slut at the end. Fourthly I love this movie because all of the actors in it are so obviously too old to be in high school. I figured as a kid that this was because the lead paint factory at the town of Rydell was dumping a lot of stuff into the water supply in those halcyon, pre-EPA days of the 1950s and the resulting heavy metal poisoning made the children of Rydell somewhat slow, which was why they were all still in high school even though they were in their late 20s and early 30s.	4.0	I love this movie	2004-07-10	7	5	2

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2GPEV42IO41CI	Kona	As the movie opens, Olivia Newton-John and John Travola are teenagers saying goodbye after a summer romance. When school starts, however, he ignores her to appear cool to his pals and we follow their hi-jinks through their senior year. There are many terrific musical numbers by Olivia and Travola, who epitomize James Dean-era teens. She is very talented and versitile, playing two different kinds of girls in the film.The last scene showing Olivia's transformation from innocent lamb to hot babe in a knockout black outfit is the best. Talented stars, rock and roll, and a little romance add up to a great movie musical.	5.0	Goodbye to Sandra Dee	2002-07-21	4	4	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2OK18C8FQ9Q89	Kristen	I admit, I love this film.  I love the music and the humor, the characters and the costumes.  But my love for the film does not mean that I don't recognize the insulting content in it.  Sandy, the blond-haired, blue-eyed girl is the symbol of purity and virginity when she arrives at Rydell High.  The school is a stereotypical representation of a white, suburban high school.  The representation of groups like the Pink Ladies and T-Birds glorify the popular/unpopular dichotomy that exists in high schools.  In the sleepover scene with Sandy and the Pink Ladies, the girls are sifting through beauty magazines and performing other activities like painting their nails and curling their hair.  The characters are acting out what society dictates as normal behavior for girls, and they perform these activities because they have internalized the male gaze.In the racing scene at the end of the film, the director uses a shot-reverse-shot technique in which Sandy is seen apart from the group gazing at the happy crowd and appearing lonely.  The camera focuses on Danny, and then focuses right back to Sandy.  It is after this that Sandy asks Frenchie to help her transform her physical appearance.  This shot-reverse-shot technique illustrates that Sandy surveys her own body through Danny's eyes.  In the final scene, where Danny strips off his preppy sweater and the camera frames Sandy's body through the male gaze, beginning at her feet and slowly moving up her body in a very seductive manner completely objectifies Sandy.  The message is that Sandy must conform to Danny's notion of beauty in order to be loved and accepted by him, and he can take off the preppy sweater because he does not have to change.  Danny's notion of beauty is that Sandy looks something like a leather-bond Barbie doll.	4.0	Problems with this musical film	2004-05-10	9	3	6

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	I have seen &quot;Grease&quot; performed on stage (a dinner theater still counts as a stage, people), so I have a great appreciation for how it was turned into a big screen musical.  Actually, &quot;Grease&quot; was the movie that proved the musical was not dead, although it did not really inspire the rebirth of the musical (One word: &quot;Xanadu&quot;).  Sweet All-Australian girl Sandy Olsen (Olivia Newton-John) had a summer romance with greaser Danny Zucko (John Travolta), and now at Rydell High he is too caught up with his cool dude image to admit he really, really likes her.  Travolta puts his charm into overdrive while Newton-John looks so darn cute and perky you might not be able to stand it, but Stockard Channing as Rizzo steals this movie in my book (&quot;There Are Worst Things I Could Do&quot;).  For the most part the choreography by Patricia Burch (who would get the opportunity to direct &quot;Grease II&quot;) is better than the songs and the songs are not half-bad.  However, my favorite will always be &quot;Beauty School Dropout&quot; sung by Teen Angel Frankie Avalon, which might be as funny a tongue-in-cheeck song as you will ever find in a Hollywood musical.  One of the other things I like about &quot;Grease&quot; is that it retains its hard edge; there are a couple of cruel lines in here that you are not going to want to explain to younger kids (you will have enough trouble explaining how Sandra Dee is to them).  However, they do serve to anchor the movie a bit.  Not a deep musical and not particularly romantic per se, just one where a good time is had by all.Most romantic line(s): (1) &quot;Oh Danny, is this the end?&quot; &quot;No Sandy. It's only the beginning.&quot;  (2) &quot;Tell me about it...stud.&quot;Two Tear-Jerking Scenes: Um, there are several scenes with some jerks, does that count?If you like &quot;Grease,&quot; then check out these other films on AFI's list: #12 &quot;My Fair Lady.&quot;  Why?  Because they are both based on Pygmalion and the transformation of a female from social outcast to paragon of social grace.  Oh, and they both have singing.	5.0	AFI's Great Love Stories: #97 Grease	2002-06-13	12	7	5
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2	Lawrence Wegeman, Jr.	This movie will certainly return the viewer to not only high school years but the years of the 1950's. The malt shop, the dance, hanging-out, the drive-in movie and rumbles are set to the (then) songs of the original musical by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. One of the best dancers of all times, John Travolta, steps lightly across the stage with Olivia Newton-John, delivering a delightful sense of those long gone years.This creation will always stand as an epic musical.	4.0	High School Musical	2012-07-09	1	0	1

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A6F97U4CSFDAP	litemakr	"When Grease was re-released to theaters in 1998, Paramount inexplicably remixed the soundtrack. There seems to be no good reason for this, but it was during a time when ""special edition"" releases were constantly messing with the original version of films. Unfortunately, there are numerous errors and changes in the remix. Some are downright inexcusable, like percussion and background vocals in the wrong place, bad music edits and even background vocals out of sync during You're the One That I Want. Foley and dialog balances are off throughout. It's a mess.Despite the fact that fans have been complaining for years, Paramount included only this remix on the 2 DVD versions they released. I had assumed they would finally include the original soundtrack on the blu ray, but they are STILL only using the botched remix. This is unbelievable. Including the far superior original soundtrack would cost them virtually nothing, and yet they continue to disrespect a popular classic movie and it fans, despite being repeatedly made aware of the problem. I bought the first 2 DVD editions, but refuse to buy a blu ray until they fix the soundtrack.The only way to hear the original, correct soundtrack is on pre-1998 VHS and laserdisc copies. I guess ignorance is bliss, and if you don't know what you are missing it won't bother you, but I can't stand to watch the movie with the remix."	1.0	BEWARE -  does not include the original soundtrack	2006-09-20	21	18	3
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2ZB9H309WH8BH	"Liza Brown ""Sarah"""	"Randal Kleiser's twelfth film ""Grease"", starring high school heart-throb Danny(John Travolta), and Australian goody-goody Sandy(Olivia Newton John), is a pure classic. Everyone has seen and loved this hysterical musical.Danny and Sandy spend their summer days frolicking on the beach, content in summer loving. Once school starts again, Danny, thinking he will never see Sandy again, is back to his old tricks, until he finds out she is also going to the same school. Of course the standards of being as slick as hair grease don't exactly make him very appealing to Sandy, and the two go through a series of ups and downs before finally reuniting at the film's end.The high school starts to buzz with stories about Danny and Sandy, as one by one everyone puts two and two together and connect Danny with Sandy. Danny, completely unaware of the extent of the rumors runs into the boys late one night who question the truth of these stories.I thought that every song in this lovable comedy were interesting and funny. I was laughing constantly. It had a very thin plot, pretty much the basics; Boy mets girl. Girl mets boy. Boy and girl fall in love. Boy looses girl. And in the end Boy gets Girl back. Typical romance film. I had never seen one of Randal Kleiser's movies until I saw Grease, and I think I might pick one of his other movies the next time I go to Flicks And Picks.I don't know if Randal Kleiser intended for the watcher to take anything away from this film, but I guess if u look really hard you could say that it is like a 1950's version of Romeo and Juilet. Two Sides, the greasers, Danny, and the goody goodies, Sandy. Even though their friends say that they shouldn't be together they still want to be with each other, but unlike Romeo and Juilet, Grease has a happy ending, and Danny and Sandy don't die."	3.0	Grease, A Middle School Review	2005-10-13	3	1	2

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2W00XKTTF1G0Z	"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa..."	GREASE was directed by Randall Kleiser (The Blue Lagoon, Honey, I Blew Up The Kids) as an attempt to revive the old Movie Musical format. It was a great success on Broadway and it wasn't until Paramount Pictures took on the challenge before anyone realized the movie musical, if done right, could be a great success.This movie has the best casting around at the time. John Travolta (Saturday Night Fever, Face Off, Pulp Fiction) and Olivia Newton John (Two Of A Kind, Xanadu) as Danny and Sandy trying to make their senior year in high school the best it could be after spending a summer together falling in love. The trials and tribulations of high school, graduating, rivals gangs and sexual advances all in the 1950's - a time of music and passion and a lot of simple things.Great costuming, great musical arrangements and the best part for me was the choreography. Staying true the tradition of musical theatre, the dance numbers where fun and energetic and simply the best for a modern day musical on the screen. Such hits came from his movie like the title track itself GREASE (written by Barry Gibb), You're The One That I Want and Hopelessly Devoted to You are a few that made the pop charts back in 1978.Great supporting cast members and some incredible performances by Jeff Conoway (Taxi, Babylon Five-TV,  Man On The Moon) Didi Conn (Violet, Grease 2) , Michael Tucci (The Garry Shandling Show, Blow) , Sid Caeser (Your Show Of Shows-TV, Grease 2, Vegas Vacation), Eve Arden (Under The Rainbow, Grease 2) and the best of them all Miss Stockard Channing (The First Wives Club, The West Wing -TV). Her performance as Rizzo could never be matched.This movie is fun for everyone and whole family and will keep your toes tapping and the tunes humming long after you see it. The DVD extras include and anniversary celebration for the movie as well as a retrospective on what it took to make this thing happen.

It is not enough to make me never watch again, but why I give it a 4 star rating.Olivia Newton John's voice is lovely and I love ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"". John Travolta can do no wrong!Kudos for Casting to include some of the stars from the 1950's.  That is a wonderful bonus."	4.0	Great fun!	2010-01-08	0	0	0

I think everyone knows at least one of the songs, even if they haven't seen the film. &quot;Grease is the word&quot;, &quot;Summer Lovin&quot;, &quot;Grease Lighting&quot;, &quot;Hopelessly Devoted To You&quot;, &quot;Sandy&quot;, &quot;There are worse things I could do&quot;, &quot;You're the one I want&quot; and &quot;We go together&quot;.

Has hollywood gone very greedy.  I say yes.  The only extras are interviews. BIG DEAL.  What about commentaries, Making of,maybe bloopers.  I thought because it took such a long time for this to be released, the studio would have been working on a nice package with plenty of extras.  Not so here.  Hollywood is just so greedy I'm sure they might wait til they get suckers to buy this and then they will come out with a big package.Another big problem ,in some scenes the ads in the background are unable to read.  The picture and sound are not up to DVD quality also.  Thank god I didn't have to pay to preview it either.  My advice is keep your VHS version.	1.0	"This dvd is ""NOT THE WORD"""	2003-03-15	15	8	7
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	"The 20th & 25th anniversary have both passed, and there's still no special edition of this. Do we really have to wait until the 30th anniversary? There's so much good stuff that could be put on the DVD, instead we get a lousy songbook. Which is stupid, cos if you've seen the film enough times and have the soundtrack, you'll already know all the words!But still I love the film and always will! I've loved it since I was young, and Sandy & Danny make the perfect couple. There's so much chemistry between Olivia Newton John & John Travolta, not something you see too often in movies. All the supporting cast are brilliant, although only Frenchie (Didi Conn) returned for the sequel.There's been many complaints about the fact how much older the actors are than the characters they play, but so many films aimed at teenagers do this nowadays. There's only two in Grease who are actually still teenagers: Dinah Manoff and Lorenzo Lamas were both 19. John Travolta (Danny) was 24; Jeff Conaway, Michael Tucci, Barry Pearl, and Didi Conn were all 28; Olivia Newton-John was 29; Jamie Donnelly was 30 and Stockard Channing was the eldest at 34.All the songs are brilliant, although I still find ""Grease"" and ""Sandy"" slightly dodgy, they don't match the rest of the songs. ""You're The One That I Want"" is definitely my favourite but Randal Kleiser hated the song saying it ""sounded awful"". It also helps the film go out on a high, I don't think it would have done as well if it hadn't featured in the film, as ""We Belong Together"" doesn't work as an ending song to the film. Filming of the song took just an afternoon. Of course there's the stunning entrance of Olivia I also love ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"", as it means a lot to me these days.It's a feel good film, and I still don't understand why some people haven't yet seen this movie! It's one of those films you'll watch once or twice a year, but are much better than say the other films that shown annually, like Wizard of Oz, or Gone With The Wind. This will stand the test of time, and is still loved to this day.Normally, when I buy a DVD, the special edition gets announced soon after.

I was finally able to get it to work on my Humax Tivo DVD player/recorder, but when I had tried to play it on my Phillips and Toshiba machines, the songs would be skipped over completely during movie playback, and random lines of the songs were skipped during playback of specific sing-along tracks.  Also, no lyrics would show up at all.  I was very bummed since this was the only reason I purchased this new edition.	4.0	Great if the Sing-Along Works For You	2006-10-10	1	1	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3RYIN4KHLR3Y1	Melissa	I wasn't too sure about Grease right off the bat and don't really remember falling in love with the movie right away. Though when I was older I have respect and a very much liking for it. When I went to see the stage play in DC I always liked the Broadway Play better then the movie. However, the movie is a pretty great addition to the teenage-musical-era. John Travolta does a pretty amazing job singing and dancing as Danny, one of the head Greasers. And Olivia Newton John does an excellent job pulling off playing sweet and loving Sandy, and then to wild Sandy at the end of the movie. They also make the perfect pair for this movie. The rest of the cast is quite incrediable and memorable as well. This movie will always be a classic and beloved. And I don't think I need to say what it's about because the name speeks for itself :) everyone should know what it's about.The only thing I was disappointed in is the DVD quality. I was expecting a lot more, and apparently everyone else was too. It has a pretty good interviews with some of the cast from Grease but it's nothing we haven't heard about before. And a theaterical trailer. And then of course the movie. As much as they advertised Grease coming out on DVD it's pretty much a slight disappointment especially it being the 20th Anniversary of Grease you just expect a lot more.However, I would give the movie about a B+ - C+ and a DVD about a C-.	3.0	A Very Classic Musical-Great Movie	2002-10-17	5	4	1

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"In 1971, writers Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey wrote and composed the music for a musical entitled ""Grease"".  It appeared first as an amateur production in Chicago, but eventually went to NYC as both off-Broadway and Broadway productions.  With the musical's Broadway success, Paramount Pictures produced it on film in 1978 under the direction of Randal Kleiser, whose previous directorial experiences had been primarily TV series and made-for-TV films.The story for ""Grease"" is simple: in circa 1959, an uprooted teenaged girl from Australia, Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John), meets and has a summer romance with a local American boy, Danny Zuko (John Travolta).  At the end of summer, her family remains in America instead of returning to Australia. She is enrolled in a local public high school, Rydell High School, which just happens to be the same high school that Danny attends.  When she runs into Danny, his persona changes to what his friends expect: cool, uninterested and a practical joker.  Sandy is naturally upset, but she doesn't yet understand the dynamics of his friends, who are in two exclusive cliques, the T-Birds (the guys) and the Pink Ladies (the gals).  One of the Pink Ladies, Frenchy (Didi Conn), befriends Sandy and Sandy gets to spend some time with other Pink Ladies, who include Betty Rizzo (Stockard Channing), Marty Maraschino (Dinah Manoff) and Jan (Jamie Donnelly).  The T-Birds include Kenickie (Jeff Conaway), Doody (Barry Pearl), Sonny (Michael Tucci) and Putzie (Kelly Ward).  The principal of Rydell is Principal McGee (Eve Arden), who is assisted by they bumbling Blanche (Dody Goodman).  Other characters include football coach Calhoun (Sid Caesar), auto-mechanics teacher Mrs. Murdock (Alice Ghostley), Vince Fontaine (Edd Byrnes), Cha Cha DiGregorio (Annette Charles), older malt shop waitress (Ellen Travolta) and a cameo by Frankie Avalon as the Teen Angel.  The musical group Sha Na Na is also featured.Casting for ""Grease"" continues to be an issue for many people after 25 years because the average age of the actors who portrayed the Pink Ladies & T-Birds (including Olivia Newton-John) was 28. (The oldest was 34 and the youngest was 20 when it was filmed.)  Of these, Stockard Channing performed best, followed by Didi Conn and Jeff Conaway.  Eve Arden and Dody Goodman work very well together in the film.  The most memorable scenes in the film include Sandy meeting the Pink Ladies & finding Danny, the sleep over, trips to the malt shop, the drive-in, Frenchy's dream, the school dance, the drag race and the carnival.  My ratings (out of 5 stars) for some of the songs in the film include:* ""Grease"" (4, sung by Frankie Valli.) Title song.* ""Summer Nights"" (4.5, sung by Olivia Newton John & John Travolta.)  On the first day of class.* ""Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" (5, sung by Stockard Channing.)  At the sleep over.* ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"" (5, sung by Olivia Newton-John.)  At the sleep over.* ""Sandy"" (4, sung by John Travolta.)  At the drive-in.* ""Greased Lightnin'"" (4, sung by John Travolta & the T-Birds.)  At the high school auto-mechanics shop.* ""Beauty School Dropout"" (5, sung by Frankie Avalon.)  Frenchy's dream.* ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"" (5, sung by Stockard Channing.)  At school.* ""You're The One That I Want"" (4, sung by Olivia Newton John & John Travolta.)  At the carnival.* ""We Go Together"" (4.5, sung by entire cast.)  At the carnival.""Grease"" was never intended to be a serious film.  Instead, it was intended to be a silly, fun and entertaining comedy with rock-n-roll music from the late 1950's.  Overall, I rate ""Grease"" with 4.5 (raised to 5) out of 5 stars for its fun music and great entertainment value.  Some problems plagued the release of ""Grease"" on DVD, such as the royalties lawsuit filed by Olivia Newton-John in 1998 and the need that Paramount had to blur product signs in the malt shop (which some viewers may find offensive).  The film is not perfect, but it is still a very entertaining and I highly recommend it.Following ""Grease"", Randal Kleiser went on to direct the ill-fated 1980 film ""The Blue Lagoon"" and Olivia Newton-John starred in the 1980 box-office bomb ""Xanadu"".  John Travolta went on to star in the very popular 1980 film ""Urban Cowboy"", but his acting career suffered until his role as a mobster in the 1994 film ""Pulp Fiction"" revived it.  Olivia Newton-John and Randal Kleiser worked together again on the 1996 film ""It's My Party""."	5.0	"""Rama Lama Lama Kadingy, Kading-a-dong!"""	2003-06-19	2	2	0
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A35G47HMAN8XH6	Michael B.	I remember watching this when I was a very yound child. Some of the choreography was nice, obvious talented folks singing and acting. However, the lyrics were crass, immoral, and degrading to both men and women. Nearly every song and every scene and most gestures has something to do with sex and vulgar gestures.  One of the songs was down right demoralizing and hopeless, Beauty School Dropout.  So this musical is better left in th past. With so much available to watch, I recommend another selection. Simply too crass, and very low rent.	2.0	Not for kids	2014-02-24	1	0	1

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AUSATFDSU2INS	"milss ""Yellow hair warrior"""	Almost 30 years alter its premiere; Randal Kleiser's Grease is as popular as ever. To what do it owes its everlasting attraction? Maybe it's because this nostalgic musical vision of the fifties is one of those films where everything fits right into place.Without a doubt, another determinant factor that helped become this movie a classic is the great chemistry between its stars, beautiful Olivia Newton-John and the lovable and charismatic John Travolta.Grease is the store of Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsen, two teenagers that share a summer fling and upon the end of their vacation, go separate ways. Fate brings them together when sandy is transferred to the same high school Danny goes to. He's the typical adolescent, good looking, cocky and with a bad boy image. She's sweet, innocent and nave, but not boring. She wears pink and is the antithesis of the girls on Danny's school.These two are as different as day and night, and along their friends will live turbulent and funny moments, typical of adolescence, until get that happy ending we expect in romantic movies.A musical lives or dies because of its soundtrack, and it's here where Grease shines thoroughly. The catchy songs, the always optimistic lyrics and the choreography spread rhythm with more power than a virus. The film, thank God, has been digitally restored and remastered. In Grease there is not one boring moment. It's a continuous celebration to the 50's pop culture, to adolescence, with the gracious touch of a director who knew how to conjure pure energy on the screen. There isn't necessary an excuse to watch it again and see why Grease is still the word.	5.0	Still the word	2005-05-13	30	19	11

She declined, saying she was looking for more mature roles, what an idiot! Allen Carr (producer) met Olivia at a dinner party and decided she  WAS Sandy, Grease was already in production, so they changed the role of  Sandy to fit Livvy's aussie accent. Can you also imagine this film without  the songs, &quot;Hopelessly Devoted&quot; and &quot;Your The One That I  Want&quot;? These songs came about when Olivia was hired and her  songwriter, John Farrar, wrote those 2 songs for the movie. Originally,  these songs would not have been in this movie if not for Olivia. Can you  imagine how boring this movie would be without those 2 songs? The original  broadway play does not include these songs, and well, YAWN is the best  description I can think of. Travolta cried that Olivia has these 2 great  songs and he didn't have a solo to sing, afraid he would be upstaged by  Olivia. So, the producers wrote &quot;Sandy&quot; just for him. That song  originally was not to be in the film either had John not had a temper  tantrum. I can't imagine GREASE without these songs or Olivia. So why does  everyone give John top billing in the credits when Olivia is the charm  behind Grease? Olivia recently filed a lawsuit because she isn't getting  her share of Grease millions.

The film is set in 1959.  Rock n roll is just making its influence felt.  This film is about those who embraced rock n roll as their lifestyle.  A sort of bad musical version or the Blackboard Jungle meets Gidget.The only truely positive thing I can say about this film is a fantastic performance by Stockard Channing.  She proved early that she was a rare breed.  An actor that can be good despite the material!The musical score ranges from very good to very mediocre.  If you like the songs, get the music videos from the film.The book / screenplay is very thin.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ALSDJP35S1DB4	"Mr. King ""Lit/Comp 9A"""	"by Shaniqua Wright.The best part of Grease is the romance part. The reason it's the best part is because every time Danny and Sandy break up with each other they either sing or cry back to each other. To me it's a sad part. When Danny tried to kiss Sandy in the drive-inmovie, Sandy got out of the car and ran off. Danny ran after her but he couldn't find her. So he started singing a song called ""Sandy"", singing that he was lonely.Another interesting part in Grease is the prom night. On the prom night Danny and Sandy were dance partners. When Sonny and Rita came to the prom. Sonny grabbed Sandy when she was dancing with Danny. Danny kept dancing and went to grab Sandy. Rita grabbed Danny and started dancing with him. Sandy left the party. Danny and Rita won the trophy, but Danny was hurt because after they won the trophy, they had to slow dance together. Danny wanted to win with Sandy.The last part of Grease I'm going to tell you about is when the teenagers went out on their dates. Danny and Sandy were dating while Kenichie and Betty were on their date. While Betty, Frenchy, Kenichie, Doody, Sonny, Putzie, and Marty were dancing, Danny and Sandy had snuck in. They sat at a table and put the menus up so no one would come over. The waitress came over to take their order. Danny ordered a bunch of food. Sandy ordered the same. Danny asked her if she was going to eat all of that. Doody came over there, then Betty, Frenchy, Kenichie, Sonny, Putzie, and Marty came and crowded Danny and Sandy. Danny was disappointed because he wanted to be alone on their date. Kenichie and Betty got into an argument with Kenichie because he put his arm around Frenchy. Betty got mad and threw strawberry milkshake in Kenickie's face.To find out more about the movie, rent it or buy it."	5.0	Grease	2005-10-22	1	0	1
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2F3M93RRLFQNJ	mrliteral	"Grease was probably one of the last significant live action musicals.  Despite the recent success of Moulin Rouge, there is little to suggest that this genre will be making any sort of comeback.  Whatever the factors that killed the musical, Grease was not one of them:  this was a fun movie when it came out and continues to be fun nowadays.  (My guess is that that other late seventies musical, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, bears a greater responsibility for the faltering of the genre.)Like any musical, success at first hinges on the music, and this one has some great tunes.  Secondly, however, it must have a good story, and this one, simple as it is, suffices:  the tale of Danny and Sandy, two high-school students in love despite their obvious differences, is just enough to keep things moving.There are flaws: the flow of time is inconsistent; it seems to take place over a few weeks, but it actually winds up taking a whole school year.  Also, Sandy's transformation in the end from saintly to slutty in an effort to win Danny, while possibly necessary from a plot standpoint, is also more than a little sexist...I don't demand political correctness out of movies, but this ""lesson"" does stand out as a bit demeaning.These are quibbles, however, and overall, this is a good movie. Although I have watched this movie maybe four times, the last time before getting this DVD was maybe twenty years ago.  A couple of decades of life can change a perspective of a film, but I was delighted to see that I still liked this one."	4.0	Lightweight musical fun	2002-09-30	1	0	1

He definetly makes his mark on this movie. It's still the best movie he has ever done -- as what he has said when being interviewed -- the man himself.The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard, and it has some great moments in it. It's one of those movies where you just watch it for fun.It doesn't really have a plot, and doesn't need one. Just about people graduating from High School who are happy about the life ahead of them!Only one thing, the last time I watched it, the people in it look too old!!! They are suppose to be in high school, but they are 10 years older than the age they are suppose to be betraying! I noticed that so much the last time I watched it! It did spoil it.It's one of those really popular culture things that I do agree with that is great!I prefer non-commercial things generally, but blast it!

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	"""Grease"" is the phenomenally successful musical that made John Travolta a legend, put Olivia Newton-John on the US pop charts and brought hot pants back into vogue. It's the seventies slant on fifties pop culture and it moves like gangbusters. The songs are ""electrifying"" and the energy generated by all of the cast members is ""greased lightning"". Unfortunately, Paramount has given us the film in a really lack luster edition that is doomed to disappoint from the start. The print, although restored, exhibits grain, dirt and digital grit, along with aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement problems that really distract from the presentation of this film. There's also a couple of curiosities. Watch for the scenes that take place at the malt shop between Danny and Sandy. All the background ads (presumably Coke or Pepsi advertising) has been digitally altered or blurred so that it can't be made out. Like the Warner release of ""The Devil's Advocate"" one can only assume that whatever was hanging on those walls, Paramount did not own the rights to and was thus forced to do some digital manipulation to satisfy a law suit before releasing the movie to home video. The manipulations are obvious and horrible, drawing attention to themselves with aliasing, hard edges or halos appearing around characters as they walk back and forth in front of the obscured art work. The audio has also not been well represented. Dialogue is strident, scratchy and soft while the musical numbers explode from the 5.1 mix with too much bass and side channel information that drowns out the lyrics represented in the center channel of one's home theater system. Extras? - true to its penny pinching, Paramount gives us the same old tired featurette that accompanied its laserdisc release. That's it. All of Paramount's marketing has gone into hailing this disc as ""The one that you want, the way that you want it."" I assure you, this isn't the case."	2.0	THE ONE THAT YOU WANT, NO WAY THAT I WANT IT!	2003-03-04	12	9	3

Grease and The Nightmare Before Christmas are both tied for first place in my book. I love the 1950's and tis fit the bill. This movie has dancing, music, singing and a great story behind it. When watching it almost tears your heart apart to not see Danny and Sandy together but you understand the feelings of young love and also the same feelings and ways that high school and being a young adult brings to you even today but with a happy ending that makes it. One to bring home and watch with your sweet heart.	5.0	Grease	2014-06-08	0	0	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A14J1ZV4CTMDJP	Nuclear Snake	I simply cannot put into words how much I HATE this stupid film and its godawful soundtrack, which were all over the place -- sort of like a roach infestation in an abandoned apartment building -- in 1978. I hold this anachronistic piece of crap and its unrealistic, annoying stereotyping of a decade personally responsible for having the most annoying '50s caricatures invade my life and, even worse, for prolonging the singing career of Olivia Newton-John, a no-talent Barbie doll.The plot of this movie is a joke, presenting a cornball romance novel theme that wouldn't even pass as a third-rate soap opera, all dressed up in leather jackets and poodle skirts. And it sends a great message to the young women of America: In order to get the man you want, be a slut -- or at least sell out your real personality.As for Vinnie Barbarino ... I mean John Travolta ... being a singer, well, then I'm FDR! The soundtrack is every bit as awful as the film it's part of (hmmm, at least there's symmetry!): Cloying, obnoxious, pseudo-rebellious dreck sung as if they've all inhaled helium, with melodies so pitiful it's amazing anyone bought this nonsense. But what do I know? With enough relentless hype, they managed to sell the soundtrack as well as tickets to the film and prove P.T. Barnum was right again.I'll grant that musicals aren't intended to be realistic, but even as fiction, Grease has about as much to do with the '50s -- particuarly the music -- as the Village People. If you want to know what really mattered as far as rock 'n' roll in the '50s, I offer you these names: Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Link Wray, Gene Vincent, Little Richard. Real music, unlike the sound pollution spewed from this so-called film.	1.0	'50s stereotyping and bad music	2004-12-09	49	20	29

The DVD release is of course the quality movie you remember and probably own on VHS.The 1-STAR rating is for such a poor job of quality on DVD (lets not even go off on the cheap cardboard case).  Its looks as if Paramount found the worst print of film and threw it on DVD.  There are dust speckels and drop ins everywhere (almost like going to see the movie at one of those dollar theatres after the print has been run a hundred times at the first run movie house.What was REMASTERED, I cannot tell, even the 5.1 audio leaves me questioning, but then again quality of picture kills the whole DVD.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3W28FJBC5VBAM	Patrick	I saw this when I was only a little boy, but to this day I can still pop it in the DVD player or the VCR and enjoy the music and acting and just the wonderful vibe it puts out. This was origionaly a musical on broadway and I think Hollywood did a smart thing by making it into a movie and it has become a classic.Ovewr the summer, Danny and Sandy meet, and seem like the perfect match, but when they suprisingly meet up at the sma eschool the following fall, Danny must keep up his reputation with the T-birds as a tough, macho guy, and at a pep ralley, meets Sandy and makes a fool out of himself saying that the Danny over the summer is gone. Now Sandy wants nothing to do with him and forms a friendship with some off the wall pink ladies and one night, Rizzo goes off and sleeps with kenicky ( spelling? ) and gets pregnant and later in the movie this becomes a big thing at a drive in. And so the story goes with Danny and Sandy going through ups and downs of a relationship, and then singing about them, and I have to say that the end still gives me goose bumps. I don't know what it is, that fact of Olivia newton-john in tight clothes or the singing and fuzzy feling, but it is a great scene.This is definitaly a good moive and any one of all ages can enjoy it and understand it, except for some language. It is a truely great piece of work!	4.0	An actually good Musical-turn-movie	2003-11-02	2	1	1
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3M2495ILWOTIX	Patrick Hubbell	This summer I had the privilege and pleasure of being part of a local production of Grease, albeit in an offstage capacity. It was amateur, though not amateurish. Sure, most of the cast won't be seen on Broadway, but I came away with a pretty good idea of what Grease the Musical should look and sound like.Unfortunately, you won't find out if you purchase Grease the Video.This version is a 50's musical in a 70's setting, or a 70's musical in a 50's setting. I haven't decided which. Moreover, I don't think the producer, Robert Stigwood, had decided either when he embarked on this project.Stigwood, in case the reader didn't know, also produced the movie musical Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band based on the Beatles' album (as if I had to explain this. Or do I?) That movie was featured in Golden Turkey Awards: The Worst Achievements in Hollywood History by film critics Harry and Michael Medved.  In Grease the Video, caricatures of 50's greasers sing songs that careen across two decades. The original Greased Lightning is here, but so are You're the One That I Want and Hopelessly Devoted to You, sung by Olivia Newton-John, an immensely cloying and annoying vocalist. Sure, the added songs are good by Top 40 standards. But what are they doing here? Had Stigwood produced Fiddler On the Roof, we might have had to listen to the diaspora singing disco.Adding songs that weren't in the original was bad enough. Some songs were cut to make room for the 70's updates. Missing from the video is the exuberant opening number, a parody of the Rydell High School alma mater song. Also missing is the tender, plaintive It's Raining On Prom Night. Alone at the Drive-In got switched for a sappy Sandy. You're the One That I Want took the place of the snarling little darling I'm All Choked Up.Grease the Video is not without some merits. Frankie Avalon is an inspired choice as the Teen Angel who sings the hilarious Beauty School Dropout. Stockard Channing also appears as the cynical yet vulnerable Rizzo. I suppose there are worse things Stigwood could do. Find out for yourself. Go rent Sergeant Pepper instead, and save the remainder to see a local production of Grease As It Should Be.	1.0	THERE ARE WORSE THINGS I COULD DO	2001-07-17	27	6	21

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2H88KIBIFQSRQ	Paul S.	Actually, I give the movie 5-stars and the DVD 2-stars.  So actually that would average out to 3.5 stars.  Since I love the movie itself, I was generous and rounded up to 4 stars.While I am a great, great fan of Grease (I must have seen it at least 20 times during the summer of '78), I must say that the DVD release of this wonderful film is somewhat disappointing.  The fact of having Grease now on DVD is terrific, but for the length of time us fans have been waiting for it, you would have figured we would get a DVD packed with extra features, not just a watered-down interview from VH-1 and a theatrical trailer.  Like George from 2 posts ago mentioned, there could have been deleted scenes, outtakes, commentaries - all pretty standard DVD fare.  At the very least there could have been a cast bio page so we could all at least know what all our favorite Greast cast members have done since then.  With the lean-ness of this DVD, Paramount could have released both the Widescreen and Fullscreen versions of the movie on the same disc rather than 2 separate ones.  It looks like they just put together these DVDs because of fan pressure to release them and didn't put much effort into them.  Heck, I have some old Clint Eastwood westerns like Hang 'Em High and A Fistful of Dollars that have more content on them than Grease does.  And they've been out for a while and only cost me $9.99.  One other note, I don't really care for the cardboard case that the DVD comes in, rather would have preferred the plastic keeper case that most DVDs come in.I guess I shouldn't get my hopes up too much for Saturday Night Fever - due out next week and also from Paramount - to be much better.  Maybe Paramount will go the way many others do and re-release it as a 2-disc set in a couple of years.  But I wouldn't hold my breath for that, judging by how long it took for the first release.  Way to go Paramount.	4.0	There should have been more to this DVD	2002-09-23	5	5	0
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1BVCH82W0M2W2	"Paul Tognetti ""The real world is so much more..."	"When the idea for making a motion picture version of ""Grease"" was approved by the moguls at Paramount back in 1977 the studio gave producers Robert Stigwood and Allan Carr a budget of $6,000,000 to complete the project.  The conventional wisdom in Hollywood was that the film would generate lots of enthusiasm initially, make a neat profit and gradually fade away as the vast majority of films do.  No one could have ever predicted the magnitude of the hit they would have on their hands.  ""Grease""  opened in over 800 theaters on March 27, 1978.  The critics were not that impressed but audiences loved it.  They still do. Not only would ""Grease"" become the top grossing motion picture of 1978 but when all was said and done ""Grease"" would become the highest grossing movie musical of all-time with a worldwide gross of some $387,000,000!I think the main reason that ""Grease"" has remained so popular over the decades is that it truly is a fun movie.  There are so many films out there featuring blood and guts that a film like ""Grease"" is a welcome oasis for many of us.  This is a film that features a fabulous musical score, innovative choreography and a remarkable chemistry among the members of a highly talented cast.  Everyone seemed to love the performances by the film's two stars John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.  Travolta loved the stage play and lobbied hard to play the part of Danny Zuko in the film.  Meanwhile, Olivia Newton-John was intrigued when offered the role of Sandy by the producers but insisted on a screen test to make sure she was right for the role.  As it turned out she was just perfect.  The chemistry between these two and their enthusiasm for this project is quite apparent from the very first scene in the film.  Meanwhile,  Jeff Conaway, who played Danny Zuko in the Broadway production of ""Grease""  adds his considerable talent to the mix in the role of Danny's best buddy Kenickie.  And let us not forget the noteworthy contributions of  Stockyard Channing and Didi Conn in the roles of Rizzo and Frenchy.  Finally, the producers added to the appeal of this film by including several 1950's icons in the cast including Sid Caesar, Edd Byrnes, Eve Arden, Joan Blondell and Fannie Flagg.  It was a nice touch.I think most folks would agree that what makes ""Grease"" so doggone appealing  is the sensational  music.  The film spawned four Top Five singles in 1978 including ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"", ""Summer Lovin"" and the #1 smash ""You're The One That I Want"".  At the same time the soundtrack LP was a monster hit as well.  Other notable tunes from the film include Stockyard Channing's surprisingly powerful ""There Are Worse Things I Can Do"",  John Travolta's ""Sandy"" and 50's teen idol Frankie Avalon (playing a teen angel) doing""Beauty School Dropout"".  The film concludes with the entire cast  cut loose at an amusement park singing ""We Go Together"".  I enjoy these tunes just as much today as I did  then!  Furthermore,  I would be remiss if I failed to make mention of the incredibly innovative animated open to this flick that goes a long way in getting viewers in the proper frame of mind  to enjoy what follows.More than 30 years after it's release ""Grease"" continues to delight audiences of all ages.  It possesses a universal appeal that is rare in motion pictures these days.  In addition, it is that rare movie that the whole family can enjoy together.  I recently purchased the ""Rockin' Rydell Edition""  that was released by Paramount in 2006.  This disc contains tons of extra features that really will enhance your enjoyment of this film.  This is a solid four star package. Highly recommended!"	4.0	The highest grossing movie musical of all-time.	2012-06-02	0	0	0

It is extremely sexually explicit, with indecent refrences the whole way through; it is so offensive that I will not buy the video because of the PG rating. I will record it off of TBS or TNT. The same uncut version on the video on TNT, is rated TV-14 (which is still an understatement) and I still have a hard time watching it. I am waiting for this movie on TBS to record because they edit the unneccessary content, and believe it or not, it is STILL rated TV-14!

Indeed ""Grease"" was part of the 1950s nostalgia phenomenon of the 1970s along with ""Happy Days"" and ""American Graffiti"" that continued with films such as ""Back to the Future"" and ""Stand By Me"" in the 1980s. America was harking back to a kinder, simpler, innocent era post-Vietnam, Civil Rights, and Watergate.""Grease"" still holds up as decent entertainment today."	4.0	Energetic high school musical set in the 1950s	2007-07-06	0	0	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	Grease has finally made its debut on the DVD format.  The movie is a long time favorite thanks to countless airings on television that constantly brought in new fans of the movie who weren't even born when the movie was released in 1978.  Adapting the immensely popular Broadway show to the big screen brought forth some changes. The theater production had a raunchier edge to it with much more overt sexual nature. The film tones that side quite a bit, but it makes up for it in sheer exuberance.  John Travolta was the hottest star in Hollywood at the time with the success of Saturday Night Fever on the big screen and Welcome Back Kotter on television.  He is perfectly cast as Danny Zuko, the likable greaser and leader of the T-Birds who falls for the wholesome Sandy Olsen played by Olivia Newton-John in her big screen debut.  Ms. Newton-John can clearly handle the singing side of the role, but her acting and dancing are suspect at best.  Jeff Conaway adds the right amount of toughness as Kenicke and Stockard Channing is excellent as Rizzo, the tough as nails head of the Pink Ladies (Ms. Channing's singing is better than Ms. Newton-John's acting, but not by much and seems oddly out of place as a teenager).  The films is full of actors and singers who were popular in the 50's like Frankie Avalon, Sid Caesar, Edd Byrnes and Eve Arden.  Grease is extremely entertaining and pure fun to watch and is really the last success old fashioned movie musical Hollywood produced.	5.0	Grease Is The Word	2002-10-09	0	0	0

I have only purchased 5 videos in my life, so that shows how much I liked it.  HOWEVER, when I watched it on the VHS, I was greatly DISAPPOINTED.  A lot of the cool things that John Travolta and the rest do are on the sides of the movie, and they were cut off on VHS!!  If you have never seen this movie at the movie theater, THEN YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT!

I remember in my Sophomore year in high school 3 years ago, we watched this and the teacher made it a better experience. It has a really good storyline, awesome actors, awesome songs, and recreates the classic look of the 50's! Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsen meet during summer break at the beach. She thinks she has to go back to Austraila, but doesn't want to because she has fallen in love with Danny. On the first day of school, Sandy comes to Rydell High School where Danny goes. He is excited to see her, but can't let his T-Bird buddies know, so he plays it cool and blows her off, but he really feels bad about it. Throughout the movie, Danny tries to win back her love.

I had to buy my ticket two days in advance just to see the movie everyone was talking about. The songs were great and the movie seemed as if it were written for the two stars. Travolta never looked better and Olivia was truly America's #1 hottie. I'd never heard so much whistling, shouts and moans as I did when the movies climax had Olivia come out in that black outfit. Everyones mouth dropped open, including mine. Like myself, people left the theatre singing and dancing and they're still doing it today.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2FW4V0UWDQ0U8	R. Delmedico	"The worship of this movie must cease.First of all, I don't even think they deserved to use the name ""Grease"" since it bears so little similarity to the Broadway show.  Missing from the movie are lovable characters Doody and Roger, replaced by a hybrid of the two named Putsy, who basically sits in the background for the entire show.  The two deleted character's songs?  ""Those Magic Changes"" basically becomes a background tune at the prom, and I have no idea (can't remember) what happens to ""Mooning"", but both songs completely lose their luster outside their original environments.  It also results in the deletion of one of the best scenes in the whole play, where Roger proclaims himself the Mooning Champion of Rydell high.Also deleted from the movie--""Alone at the Drive-in Movie"", reduced to an instrumental.  It was a funny, goofy tune, that fit in well with the parodical nature of the original show.  It is replaced by the 70's sounding ""Sandy"", which is too overdramatic and overwrought for that scene. The funny ""Alma Mater"" is reduced to background music in the opening scenes.  ""Look at Me, I'm SAndra Dee"" is moved way too far up in the show, in a really nonsensical part of the movie.  it originally came at the end of the first act in the play, which made more sense.And, worst of all, Greased Lightning is sung by Zuko, and not Kenickie, like in the play.  This makes little sense.  Zuko singing about Kenickie's car?  The idea behind the original song was that Greased Lightning was a pile of crap that only Kenickie believed in, and got scoffed at for, so his song was him vowing to turn it into a champ.Alright, but changes aside, how is the movie?Again, not great.  Scenes dragged on aimlessly for too long. Danny trying out for sports could have been easily cut down by 3 minutes or so.  The gag wore thin.  The prom's length was okay, but very boring, and basically a vehicle for Travolta to show off his dancing.  Yes, in the play, it's a big ""dance"" scene too, but it is way too straightforward in the movie to be all that enjoyable.Rizzo's ""serious"" scene is pretty much lost in the movie since it's pointlessly taken to the drive-in and tossed aside minutes later, rather than being done at the later party like in the play, and being a somewhat emotional scene.So many of the funniest scenes are deleted from the original play.  And even the melodrama is removed.  The funny parts aren't funny enough, the serious parts are too overdramatic for what this body of work really was--a parody of 50's culture, music, and life.Moreso, all of the ""high schoolers"" in the movie looked about 30 years old.  Most of them could not pass for high schoolers even with makeup and costuming.  Sonny looked almost 35. Perhaps if they had done a better job of wardrobe and makeup this would have been avoided.Overall, I think the only decent part ofthis movie is ""Greased Lightning"" for it's dance moves.  Other than that, this is a soulless remake of a great show that doesn't do the original justice.P.S. I'm playing Roger now in a local performance of Grease.

Olivia Newton John and John Travolta are simply terrific, look terrific, sing terrific and dance terrific.  Not highbrow by any means, but posesses excellent production values and it actually dates quite well.

Set in the 1950s, it deals with two senior high students who fell in love during summer vacation, and accidently meet again their senior year.  The cast is charming and the direction is vibrant.  Destined to be a Hollywood classic.  John Travolta was perfectly cast as the leader of the T-Birds.  Olivia Newton-John made a strong feature film debut in the lead.

The acting is very very good and the talent from every actor is exceptional and i'm a big fan of everyone in this really great musical.But,,,,,the stage production is 100 times better.  For some reason the movie just went ""to"" Hollywood and it didn't have to. The Broadway version captured everything that it needed and all these extras were not really needed in the movie.  Just once i wish Hollywood would take course 101 in ""Theatre.""  Maybe we could get better directors, better producers.  Again the film is great but if you have a chance to ever see the Broadway version do yourself a favor. Then write me back and tell me what you thought.  I know you'll be more than impressed.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2M66S05KKNSWC	"Rivkah Maccaby ""Rivkah Maccaby"""	"I suppose the buying audience for this film is people who have already seen it. Being so, advice on film quality is really more important that a review of the movie, so let me say, that the DVD sound is not improved over the videotape, other than the general DVD over video quality one expects. Don't let the hype about redigitized or whatever hook you.Also, understand the difference between full-screen and wide-screen. Full-screen means it will fill your entire TV screen. Since movies are broader left to right than TV screens ""full-screen"" movies have been ""panned & scanned."" In other words, You see just part of the screen at once. ""Wide-screen"" means the whole picture is shown, with black lines at top and bottom.Most people have a preference for one or the other. It's important to remember in the big choreography numbers that the panned & scanned versions are showing just half of the dancing. So be aware of what you're getting, especially if tou're buying used.Now you can read my review of the content.The ages of the actors in this film is obvious, and I personally found this really distracting. In a stage production, you can get away with casting 28-year olds as teenagers-- you can even get away with casting short adults as children sometimes. But this doesn't work in movies. --especially in a disturbing close-up of Olivia Newton-John's back teeth, as she milks one last ""Su-uuuuu-mer Lo-ooooo-ve!"" for all it's worth, but nevermind.The actors were so obviously ten years too old to be in high school, that this added an unintentional extra layer to the film; it this really a fantasy of adults going back ten years to fix things in the past? This time Danny offers to drive, and Greased Lightning wins? This time Sandy finds the kishkas to change? This time Rizzo's not pregnant? Time Frenchy goes back to school? The overabundance of happy endings and the magic car in the closing shot left me wondering.And Sandy at the end of the film? Sure, it might be time to shed the poodle skirts and pastel sweaters, but does she have to look like a 42nd & Broadway hooker? Isn't there a happy medium? And is ""learn to smoke and dress like a slut in order to get the guy you want"" really such a great message for the sweetness & light movie of 1978?Well, anyway. sellers have lots of cheap used copies, the price of which is probably worth Stockard Channing's performance. Olivia Newton-John is a singer who can't act, and most of the rest of the cast is actors who sing passably. Stockard Channing is the only really substantial actor in the film (she's won some awards for her work on stage), and she's the only performer who comes through with a genuine character as opposed to a type-- although that may not be a fair criticism, since the script has a cartoon quality that suggests two-dimensional, broad, melodramatic types. Channing is also the only performer hired primarily for her acting who also can belt out a song.My two stars are for her."	2.0	Grecian Formula	2003-01-08	17	8	9
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2NMXYVQYTWMLD	R. J Metz	I love this movie more than words could possibly say.  It begins with a boy named Danny falling in love with a girl named Sandy at the beach the summer before their senior year, not knowing they would be in the same high school in the fall.  They had their ups and downs throughout the movie but they loved each other very deeply.  It has some great songs in it too.  Most of them were in the play.  I can play &quot;It's Raining on Prom Night,&quot; on my guitar.

It may seem to be the manufacturing defect!I watched the ""Rydell Sing-Along"" feature from the ""Special Feature"" menu.  All the songs' lyrics on screen seems to create lines and pixels onto the TV screen within a few seconds when they start singing.  I mean, the movie ran smoothly but the Sing-along is my main complaint.I exchanged a copy of it for the same one and still had the same problem!  Most of the lyrics jumbled around in the screen at the same time as my previous copy of Grease!  I bought it from Best Buy and was wondering if all stores will carry the defective DVD kind.This is just a heads up to all those out there that own a copy of Grease:  Rockin' Rydell Edition.  The movie for me gets 5 stars, and have no opinion on the old version since I have not seen it myself.  The main complaint is the manufacturing process of the dvd........and perhaps I wish the deleted scenes were in color."	1.0	THE SING-ALONG IS DEFECTIVE TO ALL DVD COPIES	2006-09-21	9	3	6
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AQRODCIYD7PYX	"Robert F. Powers ""show maniac"""	"The movie version of ""Grease"" is the perfect summer movie, light,breezy,cheerful and maybe just a tad too squeeky clean for its'own good.  The original Broadway show took place in 1972 and was the 10 year reunion of the class of Rydell High.  The alumni do an extended sketch to show how they were in 1962.  This concept neatly explains the advanced ages of the players.The movie played it as a straight teenage musical and the Pink Ladies and the Burger Palace Boys(the boy gang original name) were all portrayed by actors well into their twenties with the exception of Stockard Channing who was uncomfortably nearing 40.This explains why the critics originally were luke-warm or knocked the film.(The age problem) but the critics on Broadway wern't kind either-it was the audiences that loved it.  The original show was also heavily laced with obscenities, mostly the f-bomb, which made perfect sense since the story was about a group of kids in their own little cliques who were trying to act tough and cool. The big joke was that beneath the thuggish and slutty behavior and potty mouths these wannabe juvenile delinquents were really nice-just adolescents starting to flex their wings. Another important difference between the original show was Rydell High was an inner-city midwestern school, and the movie version of the school was located somewhere in sunny California, probably Malibu.Each subsequent stage version of ""Grease"" has been sanitized like the movie and while that doesn't detract from the high energy fun it loses the high energy but grit of the original.The movie though was loaded with a slew of goodies--the peaches and cream beauty of Olivia Newton John, John Travolta in his prime and some well staged musical numbers including the ""Born To Hand-Jive"" prom number, ""Beauty School Dropout"" ""Summer Nights"" ""We Go Together""(the original stage version of ""We Go Together"" was sexually explicit and you wouldn't believe what was going on during the refrain, Boogie Boogie,Booglia etc) and ""Greased Lightnin"" which surprisingly retains the racy lyrics from the 1972 show considering the almost simon-pure innocense of the rest of the movie.I am only pointing out the difference in tone and attitude of the original from the movie but I enjoyed the film in 1978 and I still enjoy it in 2006 but it is just not the same as it was in 1972 and wowed audiences on Broadway for over eight years.So this movie is still a great watch on a ""Summer Night""."	5.0	THE PERFECT SUMMER MOVIE	2006-09-04	6	5	1

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AM2PV53UX1JEQ	R. Penola	Now a part of our everyday culture, this movie blasted into theatres in 1978 and took off -- it has never stopped entertaining the masses, me included. Though it is considerably slicked-up and watered-down from the  original B'way musical (which was a lot grittier), it is consistently  enjoyable and features a wonderfully sparkling ensemble of performances.  John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John remain a delightfully imperfect team  of cartoon lovers; they share a real chemistry and what fun to see them  perform in outlandishly campy musical numbers; Stockard Channing, thought  at least 10 to 15 years beyond high school age, digs into the role of Rizzo  with relish, and manages to be moving at the same time. Eve Arden and Dody  Goodman are priceless in their principal and assistant roles.  Transformed  into a kind of cotton-candy fantasy, GREASE the movie contains many of the  50s cliches and mores that made the musical on stage so appealingly  on-target, but coats everything with a mostly appealing veneer of  sweetness.  The added-for-the-film only musical numbers, thought not  exactly typical 1950s pop fare, are breezy, catchy and fun, and have a  commercial sound that certainly caught on.	4.0	COMPLETELY ENJOYABLE	2000-01-06	0	0	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A26WVK274IA7DN	Sarah Bellum	"Though a bit uneven at times, this movie still packs plenty of entertainment. The songs are excellent and very memorable. With some musicals, the songs aren't very appealing when heard outside the context of the musical itself because they are theatrical by nature or they rely on the stage action for comprehension. (See ""West Side Story"" or ""Miss Saigon"") For the most part, this is not the case with ""Grease,"" whose songs are perfectly capable of standing alone. This is also helped by the fact some songs from the stage version were dropped from the movie and additional songs were written for the movie. We all know the story by now: greaser Danny and squeaky clean Sandy meet and fall in love over the summer, then say goodbye. Both are surprised to see one another at school in the fall and try to change in order to fit the image of the other's ideal. Aside from the fantastic songs, the film is elevated by some very good, enthusiastic performances by John Travolta, the gorgeous Olivia Newton-John and Didi Conn, among others. The stage musical's youthful exuberance carries over to the film as well, even though some of the actors appear a trifle too old to play high school students. (See Michael Tucci and Stockard Channing for two examples)  This is essentially a musical for folks who don't normally like musicals. Some language and sexual references keep this film from being appropriate for children."	4.0	Tell me more, tell me more	2006-09-19	2	2	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AEEW2CMDTYIIJ	Scott MacPherson	Today, I went out to the local video store and purchased GREASE on DVD at a very low price and yours truly is now delighted to own this long awaited film on DVD.I was delighted and disappointed by the films release on DVD.  First off, this film is just a rehash of the 1998 VHS release which was the disappointment.  ....Despite the disappointments, there are many delightful things to say about the DVD release.  I love the packaging.  This film is available in Widescreen (2.35:1) and Full Screen (1.33:1) editions...  This film is packaged like a book (like the Panic Room) with the disc inside with a GREASE Songbook, which I though was a real hoot.  I have always wanted the lyrics to all ot most of the songs from the film....With this film being finally available on DVD, the menu board and scene selction and audio options are quite basic.  The film on Widescreen or Fullscreen are presented in top notch sound and picture quality with not much dirt or dust to be found.  The sound could have been better cause it was a bit loud and scratchy at times when it didn't need to be.  There are cast and cast interviews originally contained in the 1998 VHS release and of course, the theatrical trailer which was exciting to watch.In conclusion, GREASE is greatly welcomed on DVD with its great packaging and available feautures but this DVD deserved much more extra feautures than what was put in here.  Otherwise, run out and get your copy of GREASE today.GREASE is forever the word !!!	4.0	GREASE IS FOREVER THE WORD	2002-09-29	0	0	0

T-Bird member, lady-loving, sex-playful Danny (John Travolta) falls in love with goody-two-shoes Sandy (Oliva Newton-John). Opposites attract, you know. Towards the end, Sandy realizes that if they are to be together, then she must turn herself into a sexy bad girl, just right for her Danny. The movie, filled with great songs and dancing, clearly states the true fact that this was the period where conventionality was tossed aside, and teens were who they wanted to be, loved who they wanted to. This movie was just as entertaining as the classic musicals. One of my favorites!Grease is the word, it's got groove and it's got meaning.	5.0	"""Grease"" Is The Word"	2005-09-29	1	0	1

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1XEFHQZP8Y35W	Silver Screen	"""Grease"" the movie hit the screens at exactly the right time - - smack in the late 70s when Happy Days ruled the television screens and America was nostalgic for a simpler time.""Grease"" opens with an homage to the ""summer"" movies of the 1950s - - teens Danny Zuko (John Travolta) and Sandy Oleson (Olivia Newton-John) have met over the summer and enjoyed an innocent summer romance.  The season is ending, however, and they say their goodbyes, wondering if they will ever meet again.  This being Hollywood, of course they will!Over at Rydell High on the first day of school, Danny is hanging out with his friends and fellow members of the T-Birds, a ""gang"" that likes to race cars and wear black leather jackets.  Meanwhile, the Pink Ladies, the most popular girls in school and the female equivalent of the T-Birds, led by Rizzo (Stockard Channing), have discovered that Danny's summer love is still in town and Sandy is attending Rydell.  Instead of the happy and loving reunion that Sandy envisioned, Danny puts up his tough-guy, cool persona and in the process, loses the girl. Sandy cries on the Pink Ladies' shoulders (amid Rizzo's sneers - - apparently Danny and Rizzo had a ""thing"" pre-Sandy), takes up with a jock (Lorenzo Lamas in an early role), dumps the jock to run back to Danny, who is attempting athleticism to impress her, goes to the school dance with Danny, is overthrown by the bodacious Cha-Cha, who used to date Danny, breaks up with Danny again, only to decide at the conclusion that in order to win her bad boy, she must sully her good girl reputation, tease her hair and pour herself into a skintight black leather jumpsuit.The plot is fairly nonsensical and all the actors look as though they would be teachers or members of the PTA, rather than actual high school students, but the music rocks!  The musical numbers are fun and catchy and simply MAKE this movie.  Newton-John is perfectly cast as the virginal, sweet heroine; Travolta was born to good guy at heart Danny; no one else could have played Rizzo like Stockard Channing.Look for Eve Arden, Joan Blondell, Sid Caesar, Frankie Avalon, Alice Ghostley, Fannie Flagg and Sha Na Na.All in all, ""Grease"" is a rollicking good time and worth repeated viewings."	5.0	Those Summer Nights!	2006-04-05	2	2	0

The Blu-ray ""Rockin' Rydell Edition,"" however, requires some comment.The overall picture is very good: colors are sharp, not overly saturated, good detail. No complaints -- the video transfer is pleasing.The AUDIO, on the other hand, is awful. The soundtrack musical numbers are clear and actually improved upon in 5.1 surround. But the dialog track is astonishingly muddy. There is a noticeable difference between the audio quality of the dialog and that of the musical numbers. I thought it was just my imagination until, after viewing, my wife made a comment about how hard it was to hear the dialog. This was a major disappointment, and for that reason, I would not recommend the Blu-ray edition.Haven't watched all of the extras yet, but they are as expected, fun but nothing you probably didn't already know if you are a fan of the film."	2.0	Great move, muddy audio	2009-07-10	6	6	0

The ramped up sound fx are tolerable and in some cases an improvement on the original.  However, they (sound fx) are too 'in your face'.  All audio sounds very compressed.  It seems they tried too hard to make sure you noticed the changes.  The music tracks are a different monster.  They are terrible!!!  The original tracks are not simply re-mastered.  Many additional audio tracks have beeen added.  And badly I must say.  The reverb's used are stupid big and overbearing.  The many additional layers of instrument tracks tends to bury the lead vocal on some tunes!  Surround sound is stupid over-done and exaggerated.  You will need to turn up your center channel alot to clearly hear lead vocal parts or better yet, turn off your surround sound and watch in stereo.  Even in stereo, this is the worst audio re-mastering i've ever encountered.  New instrumentation sounds very generic and electronic and clearly was laid over a complete 2-track recording,  sounds a bit like karaoke instruments, not 'in the mix'  but on top of it.  Like one guy with a pc/sequencer re-did the whole soundtrack.  And some songs were changed alot,  Olivia's 'Hopelessly Devoted to you'  has drums and full instrumentation from the very beginnig,  it doesn't 'kick in' on first chorus, like the original.  They took a 1970's movie,  set place in the 50's, and now has music that sounds like 1990's bad pop.  I assume this was an attempt to sound modern.  This re-master clearly misses the mark from an audio standpoint.  The video is superb and the DVD extras are a nice addition.	3.0	Original Soundtrack DESTROYED !!!	2007-12-29	22	19	3

I must say that it's nothing, except the story of two teenagers, whose life stories their senior high school are told through rock 'n' roll music.  Actors are mediocre, John Travolta stunk.  So if you enjoy musicals, this one's for you.  But, if you are easily annoyed, watch something else.	2.0	irritating . . .	2003-03-04	11	4	7

Grease is about two highschool sweethearts who madley fall in love over summer vacation and then they meet at school. Those two are Sandy and Danny. Kind of rimes doesn't it. Anyways they fall in love but then they start to split up as the year goes by. Danny is the most popular guy in his senior grade while Sandy a brand new school for her is nerve wrecking. She hangs out with the pink ladies who date the most popular guys in school. Sandy is totally oppossite of the pink ladies because she is really charming and sweet but then in the end she changes her looks and her adittude to get Danny back.

Recording star Olivia Newton-John made her American film debut as Sandy, Travolta's naive love interest.The impressive supporting cast reads like a who's who in this quintessential musical about the fabulous '50s.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F	"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard"""	"""Grease"" was released durung the summer of 1978 and became an immediate hit both for its story of young love and its amazing soundtrack. Like ""Gone With The Wind"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", and ""The Sound of Music"", most regard this film as being one of the greatest films Hollywood has ever produced. The movie solidified John Travolta as a movie star and made Olivia Newton-John world famous. The movie's plot is a simple one in that it tells the tale of two people who meet, fall in love despite life's obstacles, and live happily ever after. The story sounds cheesy, but the movie is timeless, as a whole new generation of viewers have come to love it thanks to the DVD and blueray market. The soundtrack is equally good with songs like ""You're The One That I Want"", ""Sandy"", ""Grease"", and ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"". Marie Osmond was offered the part of Sandy, but turned it down when she realized Sandy was going to become a so-called ""bad girl"", in which she was depicted as a smoker with large hair wearing a tight black outfit. I am sure Marie regrets not taking the role! The DVD comes with trailers, commentary, interviews, and more."	5.0	"""A Must-Own"""	2010-04-13	0	0	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3HC0JSTJRAFH5	"The Dabbling Mum ""Alyice Edrich"""	"Grease is an amazing musical with just the right balance of drama. The storyline is classic and transcends time as the underlying message hits the core of every teenager.Danny Zuko puts his ""tough boy"" act behind him as he shares a wholesome summer romance with Australian, Sandy Olsen. When summer ends, the two believe they're going their separate ways until Sandy's parents decide to stay in America and she ends up in his high school.As the two share their summer romance stories with their friends we see that Danny has reverted back to his old ways as he sensationalizes the romance by turning it into something sleazy and slutty. And Sandy over dramatizes the romance by making it appear to be a love-affair right out of the movies. Then bam, the two meet!Sandy's excited to see Danny again and believes their summer romance can continue where it has left off, but Danny--unwilling to show a softer side to his fellow greasers--discounts the romance as nothing more than a summer fling and treats Sandy badly.Sandy, choosing to move on with her life, begins to date a more wholesome guy but her heart yearns for Danny. Danny, on the other hand, discovers that he cannot live without Sandy so he tries to break into her world while still trying to live in his own. In the end, it's Sandy who breaks into Danny's world and Danny who discovers that it's okay to show a softer side--for the right reasons.Aside from Danny and Sandy's romance story, there are sub-plots that manage to mingle beautifully with the main storyline--teenagers trying to find their places in the world, girls looking for the men of their dreams, boys trying to get to third base, gossiping, and even a pregnancy scare.There is, however, lots of raunchy sexual innuendos that probably wouldn't make the cut in today's PG-13 ratings so tread lighting with kids under 13--heck stick to kids 16 and above! In all honestly, this is not a wholesome family show but it is a family show. It's funny. It's lively. It's energetic. And it's a whole lot of fun."	5.0	Sold my daughter's old version and she made me buy it back	2013-03-10	0	0	0
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A5TZXWU8AALIC	The JuRK	I've never been a big musical fan but who could resist a movie like GREASE?It's rare when a movie can take a look at a time in America and manage to capture all the fun that period had to offer.  Being based on a well-established musical play helped, I'm sure, but I also think all the other elements--especially that dynamite cast--really helped.I was a teenager in the 70's when it came out and, looking back at it now, I appreciate the filmmakers' respectful approach to the period and characters while gently poking fun at the 50's.  I doubt such a film could be made now: the characters would be caricatures and Hollywood would want to &quot;right any wrongs&quot; of the era, I'm sure.(Check out the review by the person &quot;offended&quot; by the roles of girls in the movie/1950s.  I'll bet every teenage girl in the 50's had more fun being a girl than that person in the 00's ranting about it.  Yikes, calm down.)I loved the extras.  The recent interviews with the cast and the footage from the Hollywood premiere.Mom and Dad had their youth in the 50's and we got to watch it on the movie screens of 1978.Now the grandkids get to watch it on their portable DVD players.GREASE is still the word.	5.0	A 70's Loving Look at the 50's	2004-05-25	3	3	0

This musical does a good job of capuring high school life in the late 50s early 60s. There are many top songs such as ""Hopelessly devoted to you"", ""Greased lightning"" and the title tune. The only draw back, as noted by many film critics, is that it shows the yielding to peer pressure is the only way to be popular. Other than that this is a good musical. There are many cameo appearances by Hollywood legends such as Eve Arden and Sid Ceasar. The rock group Sha Na Na played the band during the dance."	4.0	Good Musical	2003-03-03	0	0	0

Nor is it a problem with the audio or video quality. THIS REVIEW IS BASED SOLELY ON THE CONTENT WITHIN.I know I'm just asking for it giving this film two stars, but when it comes down to it, the message behind the movie is inappropriate and certainly not one I would pass on to generations that follow us. The message seems to be; If people don't like who you are, then change who you are. Succumb to peer pressure and you'll have a better chance of fitting in. And if you want to score a mate, pretend you're somebody you're not. In an ever growing and diverse society that's a message we seem to be trending away from. I hope anyway.Please don't get me wrong, I love the music, songs, and even a lot of the lyrics. If it were merely a music CD, I'd give it four stars, but it's not.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2C4EG9LRTNQW1	Thomas A. Holmes	"Other reviewers have noted that this DVD edition offers nothing different from the VHS version released only a couple of years ago. Note also that this edition does not come from the original film elements. Aside from the dirtiness of the print, the lack of extra scenes and the like, notice that most of the Coca-Cola ads have been ""fuzzed"" out. The image boost of the DVD image makes this alteration particularly clear. It's bad enough that Paramount was willing to alter the film in order to appease a corporate partner during an earlier release of the videotape; it's terrible that we are still saddled with the so-so, handmedown digital remastering of a corrupted print. Director Randal Kleiser has revealed in a September 2002 interview with ... that Paramount plans a reissue in 2004, a version with more extras; potential purchasers who have not yet bought this version may want to hold out a little longer. I should have been more patient."	3.0	Greed Is the Word	2002-09-26	20	17	3
0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3T1J6ZJ2IWX2B	Thomas Almy	I've been waiting years for this DVD, so I bought it the first day of release. The wrapper promised high quality Digital Remastered image. What went wrong? They apparently didn't think to clean the film of dust (there are some real whoppers that flash by), and spots reveal that the lenses were dirty as well. I've got DVDs of 1930's movies that look better than this. Shame on Paramount! Rent this before you buy, check it out, and see if you really want to reward them.	1.0	Movie is great, DVD really stinks	2002-09-24	60	47	13

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AKD2JK32BBLBN	Tom Goyens	This movie could only have been produced in America: musical, bulky cars, greaseballs and bleached-out white rock 'n' roll. I don't like musicals and my review will be colored accordingly. This movie is as light as that sugar fluff that they eat at the &quot;Carnival&quot; at the end. Not one second could I connect with anything that was going on. Was this a highschool or an elementary school? Surely this must be a fantasy about what the 50s were like. With a little more biting spunk this could have been a great Monty Python parody, but to me it's just a movie to quickly digest and forget all about it. I guess as a musical it has value and energy, but for the rest it had all the ingredients of those nauseating American highschool movies.	1.0	One for the choice of title	2001-05-02	19	2	17

However when the two meet up during the summer, they fall in love. But when the summer ends, the two think they'll never see each other again. However they're both wrong, Sandy and her parents have moved to America and she is now attending Danny's school. When the two discover that they attend the same school, there is a lot of debate over whether they can still be together since it's uncool for Danny to be in love with a goody goody like Sandy. However the two, against all odds, manage to stay together. Then graduation comes and Sandy is about to change in a way no one expected. The vocals in this movie are outstanding, with the breath-taking voice of Olivia Newton-John, and John Travolta's rock numbers.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2NA919DKNI49H	Tyler Foster	Nothing about the movie, just the DVD. And not even this DVD. More the fact that I know that next year, Paramount has another DVD of Grease coming out. No word on what's on it, but undoubtedly it will be better than this DVD. That annoys me...I know you want to make money. But...any fan of this movie, I'm sure, will tell you, that no matter how much they want the movie on DVD, they would rather stick to their well-worn VHS copies for another year and get the real deal the first time around than get the movie bare-bones and cough up the dough for it only to find out later that there's a better disc, maybe even a better set of discs in store.This is only made worse by the fact that most Paramount DVDs contain a trailer and nothing else in the way of features -- their most packed DVD is the original Tomb Raider.

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A18M68DE1Y6W51	Wendy Kaplan	This movie is one big smile. It isn't intellectual, it has very little to say, and the ending will ruffle the feathers of any feminist. Who cares??From the moment the first notes of the theme song blast over the credits, the viewer is solidly hooked. The cast is remarkable, one of those lucky ensembles that are pure serendipity. Young and supple John Travlota plays the 50s hero to the hilt--the guy looked great in black leather and a ducktail hairdo, and not only that, his singing and dancing aren't half bad! Olivia Newton-John is perfect as the innocent heroine Sandy; she's just plain beautiful, her singing voice is clear and sweet, and she's the perfect foil for VERY bad girl Rizzo, played magnificently by Stockard Channing.Comedy great Eve Arden camps it up as the school principal, Jeff Conway, of later &quot;Taxi&quot; fame, is bad boy Kinicki, and there are many other recognizable faces. But the star of the film is the catchy score. It works even though it's sappy, and the choreography is wonderful. This is just plain fun, and so well done that it manages to surmount every cliche it gently lampoons.	5.0	Every Collector's Must-Have	2002-09-19	5	4	1

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2ASIT0JYIGHTA	William	"My review refers to the Australian 2-Disc DVD which is essentially the same as the US edition:The first disc contain the movie with apparently a new digital remastered transfer of the film. I cannot notice much difference to the previous DVD version except it seems more compressed this time round. The DVD still only features a the 5.1 soundtrack which is problematic. The dance hall scene is where this is noticeably an issue. For example, ""Hound Dog"" and ""Born to Hand Jive"" both sound echoey and tinny, with very little use of bass. Also, the surround speakers are rarely utilised. I wonder why they just didn't put the original stereo mix in. I dislike 5.1 mixes applied to original stereo mixes. The first disc also contains an audio commentary by the director, and also the option to do a sing-a-long with the movie, or just with the music scenes.Disc 2 contains the remainder of the special features. At first glance, these look impressive but once you start watching them you realise they could have been so much more. The main reason I purchased this new DVD was to get the 'deleted and alternate' scenes. Unfortunately, these were all black and white. According to the 'Director's introduction' to these, they are not available in colour (which doesn't make sense as they were filmed that way, perhaps film stock has deteriorated). More importantly, these scenes add little value to the die hard fan as they really are quite short or just expanded on what we have already seen. I was very disappointed overall with these deleted scenes. I would have liked to see the additional beach scenes of which some can be seen in the movie trailer.Other special features include:- Remembering Grease (20 minute or so retrospective which interesting, and was compiled for this new DVD. It contains some rare footage, which was also included in previous DVD);- 2002 DVD Launch Party (this was quite good for the footage of John and Olivia performing on stage. Poor John could hardly remember the words to Summer Nights which was funny);- John and Olivia remembering Grease (this is really just extra footage from the 2002 DVD Launch party and only runs for about 2 minutes);- 1978 interview with Alan Carr and John Travolta (good but cut short. Would have been good to include the interview in its entirety);- 1978 interview with Robert Stigwood and Olivia (good but cut short. Would have been good to include the interview in its entirety);- Moves behind the dance sequences (a segment with original choreographer which shows some rare behind the scenes footage. Quite good);- Hairstyles from the film (a segment with hairdresser who shows how the hair styles were put together. Very little interest to me but other people may like it);- Original trailer (seen before on previous DVD).So, is the new special edition worth purchasing? Well, depends on whether you are a die-hard fan or not. The lack of inclusion of the original stereo soundtrack is a big omission. The deleted scenes add little value to the package. The other extras are like other DVD's ... you'll watch once, maybe twice. It would have been useful to include the original 1978 TV special which was put together by Alan Carr to promote Grease ... a lost opportunity.Rent first before buying."	3.0	DVD Special Edition	2002-09-22	0	0	0

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1ACZLAKFO6H4Y	Will Pearce	I HATE this film, when I once loved it. Growing up has made me realize a LOT of good things about maturity, and one of them is the fact that this really is a bad movie. The acting is mediocre, if not bad, and the story is crap! I would say that is high school, there is a LOT to fret over, but not a boyfriend-girlfriend thing! Leave that to an obnoxious John Hughes film! Some of the music really is intellegently written, and the singing isn't too bad either, the I just have to say, that it does not deliver anymore. I would like to say I am a big fan, as I was ten years ago, but watching it recently, I realized that this movie was utter crap, and I cringe at it. Especially John Travolta, more like John Revolta!-or just plain revolting! My parents were right when they said the film was bad, but I wouldn't listen to them, now...I wish I had!	4.0	Once loved-Twice hated	2008-09-10	10	2	8

0792148061	Grease (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AE9GUE3HHOX3U	zooni	"Grease will always hold a special place in my heart, it is part of my childhood and holds many nostalgic memories for me.  Saw the movie when I was 8, was given the soundtrack on vinyl (as well as Saturday Nite Fever) for christmas.  Played it on my ladybug turntable, and sang along to every song with my friends, 1978.  The only way to truely watch Grease is on ""full screen"".  U just can't enjoy it any other way.  I bought it on widescreen and was totally horrified.  It just doesn't have that same effect.  I later purchased the full screen edition, and again I was in Grease heaven.  Grease is one of the best movies of all time.  Olivia Newton John and John Travolta are fantastic.  This is John Travolta's best movie to date, I don't care what anybody says.  Grease will make u laugh, sing and cry.  it is just an all around, feel good movie that cannot be compared to any other.  Ask yourself this, what would you rather watch, Grease or Gone With The Wind?  It's a no brainer, Grease is the word.  I worked with Stockard Channing once and I just had to tell her I loved her in Grease and that it was an honour to work with her.  At least I got to tell one of the cast members how much I love the movie and how people still remember it to this day.  This film is loved and praised by many people and rightfully so."	5.0	Heavy on the Grease	2008-07-04	2	0	2
