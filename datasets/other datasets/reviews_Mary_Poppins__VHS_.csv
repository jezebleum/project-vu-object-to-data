I highly recommend Mary Poppins! I wish they would also release the Gnome Mobile to video and DVD it was a really cute movie that also starred Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber who played Jane and Michael in Mary Poppins, we used to have the Gnome Mobile on tape it was tape off of The Disney Channel but unfortunately it was taped over.	5.0	One of my Favorites!	2002-01-05	0	0	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3UE57S8G2G72Y	A Customer	I grew up watching Mary Poppins in Nigeria. It reminds me of the need to decolonize from European culture. For instance, their nannies reminded me of our nannies in Nigeria (not every Nigerian had or has a nanny). This film just basically reminds me that they imposed their culture on us. Even if I think it is a great film, I would still remove two stars because of the bank scene where Mr. Banks is glorifying British colonization with his colleagues. Because of this scene, I sold my copy even though the sales associate cheated me in the process. The truth is that they stay true to history, but it's still annoying to watch. On a lighter note, it is a great family film. The kids make you want to be a kid no matter how old you are because you want to have as much fun as they're having and their mother is an advocate for women's rights, which is fantastic. She's also a great mother/wife and she takes good care of the nannies. It's a fun-filled film for all ages. The soundtrack is also good (except the one at the bank for the reason I mentioned above). I hate that it glorifies British colonization in Africa. It just shouldn't have occurred. They tried to make Europeans out of Africans. What on earth where they thinking?!	3.0	Great Film, But As Someone From A Country They Colonized It Reminds Me Of The Need To Decolonize From Their Culture	2011-06-19	10	3	7

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1PCQA29APBXFM	Adorem	"Long resistant to film adaptations of her Mary Poppins books, P. L. Travers finally succumbed to the entreaties of Walt Disney, and the result is often considered the finest of Disney's personally supervised films. The Travers stories are bundled together to tell the story of the Edwardian-era British Banks family: the banker father (David Tomlinson), suffragette mother (Glynis Johns), and the two ""impossible"" children (Karen Dotrice and Mathew Garber). The kids get the attention of their all-business father by bedevilling every new nanny in the Banks household. Whem Mr. Banks advertises conventionally for another nanny, the kids compose their own ad, asking for someone with a little kindness and imagination. Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews in her screen debut) answers the children's ad by arriving at the Banks home from the skies, parachuting downward with her umbrella. She immediately endears herself to the children. The next day they meet Mary's old chum Bert (Dick Van Dyke), currently employed as a sidewalk artist. Mary, Bert and the children hop into one of Bert's chalk drawings and learn the nonsense song ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" in a cartoon countryside. Later, they pay a visit to Bert's Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn), who laughs so hard that he floats to the ceiling. Mr. Banks is pleased that his children are behaving better, but he's not happy with their fantastic stories. To show the children what the real world is like, he takes them to his bank. A series of disasters follow which result in his being fired from his job. Mary Poppins' role in all this leads to some moments when it is possible to fear that all her good work will be undone, but like the magical being she is, all her ""mistakes"" lead to a happy result by the end of the film.As to the soundtrack, its FANTASTIC!  The 5.1 surround soundmix really  puts you right  into  the scenes of whats going on!!  The subwoofer really  kicks in  many  times!!  And you feel as if you are  right  there with  the fireworks going off every which  way when the tune 'Step  In Time"" comes to its end!God bless all those who  worked on  making this  2 disc set so very  special!The extras on  this 2 disc set are fantastic!!  There is so much  new footage shown  from  the time this movie was made,  you will see outtakes and some fun being had on  the set!This is  such  a great  special  edition  that  anyone who  loves this movie will LOVE having this to own!Just  wait til you watch  these extras, you will NOT be bored at  all! :)"	5.0	THE MOST PERFECT  MARY POPPINS DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2004-12-17	3	3	0
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	ADRIENNE MILLER	Mary Poppins is a Walt Disney classic. Julie Andrews plays the title role and she won an Oscar for her flawless performance. Andrews is pure delight, wish I had a nanny like her as a youngster. Dick Van Dyke is a gem as well, great songs and dance numbers. Mary Poppins is a family treasure to be enjoyed over and over again. I highly recommend it.	4.0	"""Helps the medicine go down..."""	2008-04-25	2	1	1
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A37YWFETJOYVNN	"Agentgary7 ""captainjared"""	"I think this review will be of interest to most people. I'm one of the few people who never saw ""Mary Poppins"" as a child. You read that right. I saw it recently for the first time on DVD and here are my impressions of it: firstly, I don't know if I enjoyed this film as much as I would have if I had first seen it as a child. The movie is clearly intended for kids. Yet the film has a wonderful, infectious quality to it. You don't have to be a kid to appreciate it. ""Mary Poppins"" is a truly unforgettable film. It has so many things going for it. First is Julie Andrews, who won an Oscar for Best Actress as Mary herself, and who demonstrates supreme self-confidence in this her first starring role.  The film also won an Oscar for Best Special Effects in 1964; the technology to combine live-action footage with animation has since been surpassed (notably in ""Who framed Roger Rabbit?"") but it's never been used more effectively than here: that wonderful sequence where Dick Van Dyke dances with a quartet of animated penguins still holds up forty years after it was filmed. Unquestionably, however, the film's greatest asset is its musical score by the Sherman brothers and that score is simply a knockout. Songs like ""A Spoonful of Sugar"" and ""Jolly Holiday"" are instant classics; once you hear them you will never forget them. And a song like ""Feed the Birds"" about the old woman who sits on the steps of St. Paul's cathedral and sells bags of crumbs to feed the birds is truly affecting (""though her words are simple and few/ Listen, listen, she's calling to you...""). I don't see how anyone can hear a song like that and fail to be touched by it. The film does have its problems: the film's plot is relatively slight: basically, an oblivious and paternalistic father learns to stop being so oblivious and paternalistic.  Indeed, the film's plot comes off as a kind of ad hoc improvisation by the film's creators, just an excuse to string together a series of otherwise-unrelated episodes. Also, the character of Mary has, to my mind, a fundamental flaw (inherited, I believe, from the source material itself, i.e. Pamela Travers' books). It's never really explained why Mary is magical as opposed to any of the other characters.  Apparently, we're just supposed to accept it on principle that Mary Poppins is magical because the movie says she is and then work backwards from that proposition. But all things considered these objections are relatively minor.  The movie generates such joy and good feeling that these things really win the day. One last point: I was aware, prior to having seen the film, that it had gotten a bad rap as ""treacle"", ""syrupy-sweet"", etc. Not true. What ""Mary Poppins"" is is wholesome. It has a simplicity and an innocence to it that you just don't see in movies nowadays. Perhaps we live in a more cynical time. Pity."	5.0	A Mary Poppins Newbie	2005-07-23	4	2	2

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2HWEZE5RNDMXI	amy	Heres the thing, I liked this movie  as a child and I still love all the songs but the underlined story of big bad banks and the whole feminine, movement is pretty apparent. And what is mary poppins? Is she a witch? is she magical? And Who really cares about fat old birds over saving up your money? I guess not everyone is as synical as I am but it just goes to show once you have become an adult you have a different outlook on things. So I say if you want your kids to have some entertainment this is better than most. but also understand they might be going through a boot campof liberalism without knowing it.	3.0	Hmm	2013-03-14	5	1	4

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	So, my daughter has become obsessed with `Mary Poppins'.  She wants to be her.  She watches this movie daily, sings all the songs, draws pictures of her, runs through the house with her umbrella, asks me CONSTANTLY what `supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' means...etc.Seriously, she is OBSESSED.Normally, her obsessions ware on me, and I'm sure that in time this one will too, but one thing that has come of this is that I've actually got to sit through the film a few times recently.  Now, I saw `Mary Poppins' years ago, and I've always held it in high regard.  I love Julie Andrews; seriously.  She's one of my favorite actresses and I've always held a special place in my heart for both `Mary Poppins' and `The Sound of Music'; her two most recognizable films.  So, with years behind me, I settled in to watch this film for the first time in a long time and I must say that I was astounded at how well this delightful film holds up.  It's still just as charming and magical as the first day I saw it.But my oh my, this is a long movie!Julie Andrews, who snagged an Oscar for her performance in this film, is just all sorts of amazing as the magical nanny who comes along at the right time to spread some joy and bring a family closer together.  The rest of the cast is also delightful, even Dick Van Dyke despite a horribly shaky Cockney accent.From dazzling set pieces to beautifully composed songs to sharply meshed animated sequences, `Mary Poppins' has so much to offer!  This is a great Anniversary Edition (I know that there has been a 45th released, but this is the one I own and I see no real need to upgrade) with loads of special features to keep you and your little ones occupied.	5.0	A movie this good doesn't need a spoonful of sugar; but it has one anyways!	2012-04-11	2	2	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	AJEB4EP04U9TR	Andrew L. Smith	A few years back, none of my kids, all under 12 at the time, were interested in this movie.  All of a sudden, my 9 year old son really wanted to watch it and enjoyed it along with my 7 year old daughter.  My 13 year old daughter was quick to give us an informational summary of what the movie was about in terms of bad parents becoming good parents, and I thought it was about the nanny.  As it turns out, my son is also learning about the Women's suffrage movement and there certainly is a presence of that in this film.  My kids didn't recognize Dick Van Dyke from A Night in the Museum.  I had to point that out.  Funny.  Great film.	5.0	Kids still love it in 2014	2014-02-07	0	0	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z	Annie Van Auken	"A different sort of review this, for it invites YOUR participation!Haven't seen MARY POPPINS since 1964, and finally watched it again yesterday. The colors on my VHS copy are vivid and the film's condition quite excellent throughout.Random impressions:Seeing Julie Andrews so young and beautiful, and Dick Van Dyke without all the shaggy white hair, and Ed Wynn alive and giddy, was an absolute delight!There are SO many songs in this picture! It's practically an operetta.The live action/animation sequences are quite clever.That choreographed chimney sweep number is magnificent!Dick Van Dyke is a helluva dancer, and Julie Andrews keeps right up with him.It's not mentioned in the closing credits that Van Dyke has a dual role: as Mary's friend Bert and Mr. Dawes, the elderly chairman of the bank board.Finally, an invitation to some shared speculation---What exactly IS Mary Poppins? Is she a witch or a spirit made carnate?We initially meet her as she sits on a cloud, powdering her nose. Later, to better see her face she wants a larger wall mirror, then appears within it to sing a duet with and even outdo herself. A third looking glass moment occurs in the chimney sweep sequence-- Mary uses a compact to touch up her dirty face with more soot!Clearly, the young lady is vain. She ""hmmph""s when her mirror image outsings her, so she's also jealous, and when she refuses to answer her employer's questions, it shows Mary to be headstrong.So, IS Miss Poppins ""practically perfect""? Do all these less-than-ideal personality traits indicate she's human, after all? What do you think? Hit COMMENT below if you'd like to participate!

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	AE8RQHFMSLN0D	"Anthony Damato ""Law professor"""	I enjoyed reading Joe Comer's review (above) and agree with most of it, but we shouldn't go overboard on MARY POPPINS.  There are dreadfully slow parts; the direction and editing could have been a lot better.  The first  time I saw it &quot;Chim Chim Cheree&quot; bored me; I confess that with  re-viewings the song grows and indeed becomes one of the highlights.  But  we shouldn't entirely forget our first impressions of a movie, because most  people only see it once.  Also the music (not the words of the songs) is  quite pedestrian.  Oh what Richard Rodgers could have done with these  songs!  However, there are things in MARY POPPINS that are among Disney's  finest, and for todays kids who have the movie on the TV while they do  other things, and see it over and over again, they probably turn away  during the slow parts and run back to see the beautiful real-plus-animation  scene in the park.  When I first saw, as a child, SONG OF THE SOUTH, I just  couldn't believe how magical and enchanting was the real life Uncle Remus  appearing in a cartoon!  I fantasized about the world of movies in the  future, how things could be &quot;drawn in&quot; so that the characters  could do their thing on any landscape or planet.  Well, now it's gotten to  the point where computerized special effects do all of that, and you can't  even tell it's a cartoon.  In MARY POPPINS you can tell it's a cartoon, and  that is part of its magic.	4.0	When it's Good, it's Great	2000-07-23	12	2	10

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2IXYK8U3I0GGI	Bargain Shopper	Disney's Mary Poppins is an amazing movie. Back in its day, no one had ever really seen animated characters dancing alongside real humans, and Disney made this possible. Mary Poppins has stood the test of time, making it a Disney Classic, and for many years to come. This movie is excellent for the young, and young at heart. The tunes get your feet tapping and you sing the songs, and when it's over, you want to watch it all over again(or buy the CD)!

I still love this movie today, although I am embarassed to say I hadn't watched it for years until it came out on DVD and I got it for Christmas.  Watching this movie again for me was like riding a bike, I never forgot.  I remember all the words to every song and my favorite part is still when all the chimney sweepers were dancing on the roof and not to mention Dick Van Dyke's routine with the penguins.  As a child, I always wished I could just snap my fingers to clean my room--as I'm sure a lot of other children wished as well. :) I used to jump around the yard with my umbrella open, think I could fly away like Mary Poppins!  The point of me rambling about the significance Mary Poppins had on my childhood is that this movie gets children's imaginations running and will entertain them again and again.Aside from how wonderful the movie is, the material featured on the DVD is wonderful.  I've only watched the Making of Mary Poppins, which was so great to get an inside look on one of the greatest films Disney ever made!If you have never seen this movie (where have you been?!?) go out and buy this movie...you will not regret it!

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1Y1IMKX8ZRV4Y	Ben Adam	"Mary Poppins was unquestionably Walt Disney's greatest achievement during his lifetime. The thought of making a full-length musical movie based on the P.L. Travers novel with an all-star cast, completely filmed on a Hollywood sound stage about a story set in London is in itself mind boggling, but Director Robert Stevenson managed to make it happen. The film was Julie Andrews' first film and earned for her her first Academy Award in a story that was almost a scandal in Hollywood that year; she had been the one to create the role of Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady on Broadway, but that same year, My Fair Lady was released with Audrey Hepburn in the lead, so most of the film industry -- and Julie Andrews herself -- saw the Oscar as a way of apologizing for the slight. However, her performance in the film was, as was Mary Poppins, ""practically perfect in every way.""Appearing with her is Dick Van Dyke, the only non-Brit in the cast who none the less gives an excellent performance in the roles of Bert and as Mr. Dawes, Sr. David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns star as George and Winifred Banks, parents to Jane and Michael Banks, played by Karen Dotrice and Michael Garber. The star-studded cast also includes Hermione Baddeley, Reta Shaw, Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher, Ed Wynn, Arthur Malet, and Jane Darwell.The musical score by Robert Sherman is outstanding. The songs include ""Chim Chim Cheree"" (which won an Academy Award), ""A Spoonful of Sugar,"" ""Feed the Birds,"" ""I Love to Laugh,"" and the song that introduced a new word into the lexicon of moviegoers everywhere, ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.""The film is a riot of special effects, real-life characters in animated settings, and musical and dance sequences that make the film worthy of the label ""supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" without question. Mary Poppins the film, like the nanny Mary Poppins herself, is ""practically perfect in every way."""	5.0	Practically Perfect in Every Way!	2005-02-26	2	2	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A31I3HXMD5H1EL	Benjamin J Burgraff	"""Mary Poppins"" is one of that select group of films that can truly be called 'Classic', a project conceived in love and filled with so much child-like wonder that it will never grow old or 'out-of-date'. Certainly the crowning achievement of Walt Disney's remarkable career, the ""Mary Poppins"" 40th Anniversary Special Edition is simply magnificent!Based on P.L. Travers' tales of a magical nanny who arrives to bring families closer, the rights to the stories had been pursued by Disney since 1938, but Travers had seen what studios had done to other authors' works, and withheld her approval unless she could maintain some creative control. Years of negotiations only whetted Disney's desire to make a definitive, truly 'special' film, and by 1960, despite the box office failure of another fantasy-themed 'pet' project, ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"", he was more confident than ever in the story's potential, bringing together a remarkable array of talent, including songwriting brothers Richard and Robert Sherman, production head Bill Walsh, and the brilliant artist Peter Ellenshaw to 'visualize' 1910 London through his matte paintings.With Travers' grudging approval, casting began. While American stage and TV star Dick Van Dyke was an odd choice to play a Cockney chimneysweep, he was a gifted mime and physical comedian, and had such a wholesome exuberance that Disney knew British audiences would forgive his shaky accent. Popular British actors Glynis Johns and David Tomlinson would play the preoccupied parents, with Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber (from ""The Three Lives of Thomasina"") as the neglected children. Veteran stars Ed Wynn, Elsa Lanchester, Reginald Owen, Arthur Treacher, and Jane Darwell (as the Bird Woman, in her last screen appearance), headed the strong supporting cast.But it was the casting of Julie Andrews, in her first film, as Mary Poppins, that truly 'made' the film! Passed over by Jack Warner for the movie version of her stage hit, ""My Fair Lady"" (he opted for Audrey Hepburn), Disney caught her performance in ""Camelot"" on Broadway, knew, instantly, that she was the right 'Mary', and approached her for the role. ""But I'm pregnant,"" she told him. ""No problem,"" he replied. ""I'll wait!""And thus a Classic was born!A multiple 1964 Oscar winner (including 'Best Actress' for Andrews, who got to share the stage with her ""Lady"" costar, Rex Harrison, who won 'Best Actor'), the film was a major hit, worldwide, and quickly achieved the legendary status it holds today.For it's 40th Anniversary, Disney's heirs have put together a spectacular package; along with the digitally-remastered film (it looks and sounds SUPERB!), a second disc of additional features includes a joyous reunion of stars Andrews and Van Dyke (who both seem ageless!); reminiscences of Robert Sherman, who sings a cute ditty cut from the final film; a fascinating 50-minute ""behind-the-scenes"" documentary about the production; featurettes on how the FX were achieved in several key scenes; and much, MUCH more! As the owner of several ""Special Edition"" Disney DVDs, I can honestly say, THIS is the BEST, yet!With the holidays fast approaching, I can't think of a finer gift to give, or to get!"	5.0	Disney's Live Masterpiece Shines More Brightly than Ever!	2004-12-06	145	131	14
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2U4YFCAPF1KHI	Bennie Quincy Shaft	Bertha Zelda and I just watched this wonderful movie on BD. It is an absolute pleasure to watch a true family film with no raunchy dialog, no double entendres, and nobody getting naked. This is a wonderful story about kindness.The songs and the dancing were first rate. The talents of both Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke were truly amazing. I doubt if a movie of this high caliber could even get off the ground today. Fifty years ago was a different age.The BD looks and sounds very decent. There is much written about the impossibility of the film looking good because the special effects were done using layers of film. Well, despite that, the BD rendering of the film is still superb.

Sure, some parts of the movie seems like nothing like a green screen in the back, the pure and simple charming (Dick van Dyke, whose middle name was dubbed charming after this movie), with ""how they heck did they come up with"" songs and of course, can we repeat Julie Andrews how many times?

This is only to wonder at the one part of the film and all the commentary on the 40th anniversary edition that confuses me: the film takes place in England, but the audiotronic bird shown in one scene is the American robin, a thrush, and similar to the English robin only in color, not species.  OK, the film was for American audiences, no problem with that -- but there is no mention in any of the commentary about the discrepancy.  The only thing said about the robin -- besides the audiotronic information -- is that male robins don't sing!  I believe that is totally incorrect, for the American thrush called robin, as well as for the English robin.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A141HP4LYPWMSR	Brian E. Erland	Released in `64 `Mary Poppins' is without question one of the most beloved movies in Disney's vast vault of wonderful family film classics. I was twelve years old when `Mary Poppins' made its theatrical debut and I must admit that I immediately fell madly in love with Julie Andrews. Obviously I wasn't the only one considering the fact that Julie Andrews won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of the magical nanny.This film is what family entertainment is all about; singing, dancing, cute kids, attractive nurturing adults, a zany but lovable character here and there and a heavy dose of enchantment and childish wonder. This is definitely a keeper by all means.	5.0	"""Bob's Your Uncle"""	2008-05-22	2	2	0
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	APP5MBH2BSX6I	"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2"""	"Year after year hundreds of films are planned, sweated over, made, publicized, released, and forgotten.  Most of them are made with the sincere hope and belief that they could possibly catch a bit of the kind of movie magic that this classic family film is absolutely overflowing with.  There truly is something for everyone in ""Mary Poppins,"" and it is indeed ""practically perfect in every way.""Julie Andrews, at the height of her career, and Dick Van Dyke at his, star in one of the few Hollywood musicals where you never consciously notice that the characters are actually bursting in song whereas you and I would simply continue to speak.  That's how smooth and seamless the film is, and how brightly artful the whole thing is done.  The delightfully loony characters include a retired admiral who, atop his house, thinks he's at sea; a lovable old Uncle Albert who giggles himself literally into the air (really the only sequence in the film that seems tacked on, perhaps forced a bit because they wanted classic '50s comic Ed Wynn in the film); an aged banker who seems like he would collapse into dust if he fell to the floor (that's Van Dyke in lots of pancake makeup in a dual role); and the friendly neighborhood constable, played by Arthur Treacher (does anyone else remember Arthur Treacher's Fish & Chips restaurants?).The kids won't notice all that, they'll just be swept away by little Jane & Michael's adventures.  They'll identify with the kids having parents who are too busy to spend as much time with them as they might like, as well as the idealism of youth clashing with the practicality of grownup life, and they'll be enchanted by the magic nanny who flew in on a puff of wind.  The adults will be touched by the children plaintively trying to get their needs across to their parents (especially stodgy Daddy) and it's a hard-hearted grownup indeed who comes away from ""Mary Poppins"" unchanged in their feelings toward their little ones.  To top it all off, Julie Andrews is appealingly very pretty, which doesn't hurt one bit, from the male perspective.As an adult I often list such diverse films as ""Local Hero,"" ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" the ""Lord Of the Rings"" trilogy, ""AI,"" ""Fiddler On the Roof,"" ""Airplane!"" and ""Bagdad Cafe"" among my favorites.  Shame on me for often failing to include this, easily my favorite Disney film.  This DVD also has beaucoups of features that are an absolute treasure, and the reasonable price makes this a must-own item.  Hope Santa remembers that I did put up a stocking this year...."	5.0	Wow!

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	ACZZTXI1NHQU3	Brian J. Johnson	Standing strong beside its major competition in the 60's is Walt Disney's classic adaptation of the Mary Poppins books.  I enjoyed it as a kid; I LOVE it as an adult.I will quickly acknowledge that it is flawed: Flying wires are visible; the &quot;exterior&quot; sets are obviously indoors in studios; etc.  But the creative storytelling, fun adventures, big stars (Who couldn't enjoy watching Ed Wynn laugh himself onto the ceiling?), and brilliant songs cause the objective viewer to forget its shortcomings and lose himself in the magic.It is the story of Jane and Michael, two children who love their father dearly; but the father has formed his own hard views of how life is to be lived, and can't see the love and joy his children want to share with him.  When Mary Poppins breezes in (literally) to apply for the job of nanny, she brings with her a firm commitment to living life to its fullest.  The infectious atmosphere of joy she spreads touches everyone she meets, changing the heart of the father, and opening him up to the wonders life has to offer to him, particularly through his children.Parents with any soul at all will be touched.  Children with any imagination at all will be enthralled.  I personally have laughed and cried, even at age 27.	5.0	Disney's Triumph	2001-12-28	2	2	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A16PV864GUDFQB	"Brian S. Pratt ""Author of The Morcyth Saga, T..."	Is there no better movie out there than Mary Poppins. With stars Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, you are assured of great acting and music. Dick Van Dyke for me is one of the greates actors of all times, especially when you're talking his earlier works like this and 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'. His songs and acting are all fun and exciting.The special effects on this is definitely outdated by our standards but were cutting edge way back when.If you have kids, this will be worth your time. They love the way at the end when the kids take over the castle and put the 'Child Catcher' in the big net. He always disturbed me as a child, just something about the way way his face was made up. He has the same effect on my daughter as the Oompa Loompas of the orignal Wonka movie.	5.0	A feel good Disney Movie	2006-10-30	1	0	1

Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews, among others, share stories about Walt and their experiences while making the movie. There are some especially touching stories about Walt Disney, and the elderly lady appearing in the song ""feed the birds,"" which happened to be one of Walt's favorite songs.Another thing I enjoyed on the dvd, is footage from the 1964 gala premiere with some color footage even. There are numerous little facts and stories all throughout the bonus features that are sure to interest fans. Watching this dvd has made me like the movie even more, from realizing all the work that went into making this film.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1Q4ZU2Y929N0A	"Bruce Gray ""gurpsgm"""	"Mary Poppins is one of the stand-out live-action movies that Disney has ever produced.  The songs are very memorable - who out there does not find themselves humming or singing along with the likes of ""Chim-Chim-Cheeree""?  Julie Andrews will always be remembered for her role as Mary Poppins, and Dick Van Dyke absolutely shines as Bert the Chimney Sweep.  The story is top-notch and has a wonderful moral without being too ""preachy"".  The animated bit is a little flat by today's standards, but it adds a wonderful bit of whimsey to a stellar production.  Highly recommended to any family with children.Then why only four stars?  Because there's a much better, two-disc, 40th anniversary edition that not only restores everythig to digital quality, but adds a second disc of deleted scenes, commentary, and many other cool new features.

The movie is very enjoyable, but I am still bothered by several things. The Dick Van Dyke character is too dominant and his humor too broad. The movie seems like a vehicle to promote him and his career. I always hated the animated parts. The chalk drawings were good and the beginning animation was &#34;chalky&#34;, but then it became too-cute, patronizing animation that lacked artistic qualities. My favorite parts are still the same and adhere most closely to the mood of the book. I love the cleaning-up-the-nursery scene and the sliding up and down the bannister. She slid up without us having to have it explained to us. The laughing tea party is a delight and I can't stop laughing myself. Feed the Birds is my favorite song and touches the right note about maintaining perspective in life. All that being said, I do enjoy this movie and will buy the early books for my grandchildren and probably show them the movie.	3.0	Timeless but flawed	2014-01-21	0	0	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	ABH4G7TVI6G2T	Byron Kolln	"The all-new 40th Anniversary edition of MARY POPPINS is definitely a must-own for all fans of the movie, and has been well worth the wait.  As the editorial review states, this is the third DVD of MARY POPPINS to be released.  The last edition (on the Gold Classics label) featured a great print but scant extras and fans simply knew that the Disney company should have done a better job remastering and releasing one of their most beloved films.  Our prayers have been answered!This brand-new MARY POPPINS features a state-of-the-art new digital restored print (similar to that done on the SNOW WHITE Platinum Edition), and a veritable carpetbag-full of extra features, the big highlight being an audio commentary by Dame Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and Karen Dotrice among others.It is indeed a thrilling movie experience.  Out of the dreary London skies soars Mary Poppins, who sets about restoring the love and friendships in the fractured Banks family.  Along the way Mary leads us through many magical adventures including a 'Jolly Holiday' inside a pavement chalk picture, a tea party on the ceiling with Uncle Albert and a dance on the rooftops with Bert and his chimney-sweep pals.Other 'Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious' extras include a sequence deleted from the picture (""Chimpanzoo""), to an all-new retrospective documemtary with interviews with all the surviving lead cast-members.  Julie Andrews (who has renewed her ties to the Disney family with her role as Queen Clarisse in the PRINCESS DIARIES films) also has a lovely chat with Dick Van Dyke and composer Richard Sherman as they reminisce about making the movie.If you own the earlier DVD edition and think you've seen MARY POPPINS think again!

I used to be a fan of the movie when I was little, but this is one of the few movies that, when revisited as an adult, is just as entertaining!I saw Mary Poppins in a whole new light - things that I had missed as a little girl were all too clear to me now - Mary Poppins is more than a pretty face - she comes into the Banks family, a couple who are somewhat distracted from their two beautiful children Jane and Michael as they both pursue independent goals in 1910 London - and she makes the family remember how special family really is.Along the way, however, there is nothing but fun. It's hard to BELIEVE just how many brilliant songs and dances can be crammed into a movie and how much color and magic can be woven in there. Highlights are the animated Jolly Holiday sequence, Mary Poppins' tidy-up-the-nursery game ""A Spoonful of Sugar"", and the touching song (the favorite of Walt Disney himself) ""Feed the Birds"".A cast of all-rounded perfection completes this classic tale - such a shame that I learned the little boy who played Michael died about a decade after the movie was made! Such a cutie, what a loss...This DVD was definitely not disappointing - it's always nice to have a classic childhood memory come alive in top quality again on DVD - but the special features were more than generous, including a talk with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke about the project, and a making-of documentary with a lot of info for any movie buffs.At the beginning of this review I called this a musical - and indeed it is - a wonderful treasure that exceeds most typically ""for children"" films. This movie is for everyone - and has many lessons to be learned. The film that made Julie Andrews a star, this movie is worthy of the title ""musical"" even in the most serious of terms."	5.0	She comes to make families better	2005-06-24	4	4	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2CVP31XTYSZFE	"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom"""	"The three most most purely astounding things about this 45th anniversary release of Mary Poppins on DVD is how very, very good it looks and sounds, how very young Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke both look - and how terribly shaky his grasp on his Cockney accent really was. In one of the lavish assortment of additional features and interviews, Mr. Van Dyke has sufficient confidence and self-deprecating humor to laugh about this.In watching ""Mary Poppins"" as an adult, I was also struck by how very much it was a musical showcase for the two stars, a series of elaborate and episodic set-pieces strung together upon the barest thread of plot: a mysterious and charming governess who appears out of the blue, befriending a pair of children whose parents are too taken up by their own interests to pay much attention at all to them at all. At the end, having accomplished this, she vanishes - again, into the blue. In between these two points, the children's adventures are non-stop. Some of them are very strange, such as the long adventure into the chalk pavement painting, and the athletic dancing of the chimneysweeps on the rooftops of London - though for my money, the world of smoky rooftops seems even more unearthly beautiful now than it did ever before. No one could do cityscape matte paintings better than Walt Disney's artists. The picture galleries are always worthwhile on Disney releases, and on this more than any of the others, save perhaps ""The Jungle Book"". And no other movie can do dancing penguins with more panache - although ""Madagascar"" does have the edge on doing infiltrating soldier penguins.The extra features are suitably lavish - an all new animated adventure short, about a cat who did more than just look at a king, a look at the Broadway musical version of the chimney-sweep's ""Step in Time"" dance, and a careful reconstruction of a news feature about the premiere, full of appearances by stars and personalities what will have your children looking at you and saying ""Mmm... and they were famous for?

The sound is good, and some color balancing is better than the 40th anniversary edition where people's faces were too gray, but the contrast and grain of this release make the picture look old and worn out.  As if the Disney company really didn't want to put in the full effort required to bring this up to snuff.  As two better examples, all you need to see is the Sound of Music (made one year later), or Rear Window (made a decade earlier), both on Blu-ray to see how significantly better those films appear than this one.  After the botched restoration efforts of those two movies in earlier DVD releases, the Blu-ray releases not only provided the added resolution and clarity that comes with blu ray, but proper digital handling of the source material brought the films up to better-than-original form (something which is now quite common -- check out the Wizard of Oz first Blu-ray release).Alas, we have a long-anticipated Blu-ray release which looks to be just another recycled old war-horse, peddled by what is clearly now just a finance company, not willing to give more than they think they can, contrary to what Walt would have expected from them.	3.0	Substandard Blu-ray release -- Film needs proper restoration	2014-01-26	2	2	0

The Disney Studios were so far ahead of their time in animation and special effects that it is easy to watch the movie 50 years later and enjoy it. It is also a reminder of the &#34;old&#34; days of musicals; how did those guys write such great songs. I'm still humming the tunes.	5.0	Oldie and Goodie	2014-01-26	0	0	0
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2QZQBINBG6B5N	Charles S. Houser	"After being passed over for the role of Eliza Doolittle for the film version of MY FAIR LADY (the role she created on Broadway) for the more ""loverly"" but less vocally-skilled Audrey Hepburn, Andrews was recruited for Mary Poppins personally by Walt Disney who offered the role to her on the spot after seeing her in CAMELOT. Once given a chance to prove her screen presence she managed to turn in a number of very memorable and diverse film roles, though she is mostly remembered for her two singing nanny roles, Mary Poppins and Maria von Trapp.The 40th Anniversary DVD set of MARY POPPINS s chock full of interesting extras--interviews with Andrews and VanDyke, making-of featurettes, a game, etc. I found the black and white archival footage of the Hollywood Premier to be especially fascinating. Although there is nothing critical of the movie, the Disney studios, or Disney the man in these extras--and you do feel a bit manipulated into a sense of awe--MARY POPPINS was a great achievement that took Disney many years to pull off. You can't really begrudge the man his bragging rights. (In the trivia track of the movie, the studio is quick to assert that if the initial box-office take were recalculated based on current ticket prices, MP would be the top grossing film of all time, out-performing THE LORD OF THE RINGS, etc.).The DVD extras also helped me to understand things about the movie that have always bothered me. The music, though catchy in its own way, is consciously composed based on elements of the British music hall which I think accounts for their slightly cold, alien quality (As an American unconsciously influenced by African-American and jazz idioms, I think my ear naturally craves minor chords and more complex rhythms). Also, the featurettes reveal that the books the movie was based on were really a collection of amusing stories rather than novels with beginnings, middles and ends. It was the Disney writers who consequently had to provide the overarching story line. And in bizarre and typical Disney fashion (who in their 50s today was not traumatized by the death of Bambi's mother? or Dumbo's separation from Jumbo?), it pivots on child abandonment issues. I remember seeing MP 40 years ago and being very upset by how blithely Mary floated out of the children's lives after having worked her magic--no promise to send post cards, visit once a year on their birthdays, or attend their graduations. True, she functioned as a catalyst in the life of the children's family and was responsible for turning the neglectful, business-obsessed father and women's-suffrage-obsessed mother into caring and attentive parents, but that does little to offset the bittersweet sadness of seeing Mary lift off and float out of the young children's lives forever. I remember thinking at the time, ""She was just pretending to like the kids all along. Looking after them was just a job for her. How cold!""The true achievement of MARY POPPINS, however, was the way Disney combined animation with live action, something we probably take for granted today. Perhaps because it was harder to do this ""back then"", such sequences were well thought out in MP and never seem gratuitous. To those people who don't like to be shown ""how it's done"" and want to preserve the mystery, I would say, just ignore the ""extras"" disk. But I found the ""how to"" stuff fascinating--especially Ed Wynn's laughing tea party scene and the phenominal chimney sweepers rooftop dance number.The Anniversary edition of MARY POPPINS is worth the purchase price. You'll find yourself watching the movie AND the extras disk many times over."	4.0	Julie shows Hollywood what she's got!	2004-12-24	8	5	3

Both are terrific films, and the Disney creation fairs reasonably well against the specacular Austrian setting of the 1965 Robert Wise production.Dick Van Dyke deserves special praise for virtually stealing many scenes.

I especially love the scene which shows the first time the children are ordered to bed (after a rainstorm forces them 'out' of a watercolor painting) and, much too excited to forget about their magical day, are finally sung to sleep by Ms. Andrews in the contradictory ""Stay Awake"" lullaby. It is a great scene/number which gives some insight to Mary Poppins' character: efficient, strict, crisp, but also secretly caring and sentimental- just as long as nobody witnesses as such. This is re-iterated in her closing lines about 'practically perfect people,' but it is a carefully staged balance of emotions just the same.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A15IN5H4IATSHQ	Classic film buff	"""Mary Poppins"" will always be memorable to me if for no other reason, (but there are others I assure you!), that this is the first film I ever got to see without an adult accompanying me.  I was all of ten and a half years old in February 1965 and had been anxiously waiting for the movie to come to our local theatre for months, it finally had!  I remember badgering my mother to let the friend from school who was sleeping over (another first) and I go see the movie alone.  Certainly I didn't want to appear a baby in front of my pal, who was already going to movies without adult supervision, or so he told me.  My mother reluctantly agreed, even letting us buy our own tickets at the booth, after ascertaining what time the film let out, and told us sternly to wait right under the theatre marquee if she wasn't right there when the movie let out until she arrived.  Different times, anyway my buddy and I both loved it, and there was another momentous stepping-stone on the path to being a ""grown-up"" for me.That piece of nostalgia aside, ""Mary Poppins"" is besides ""The Wizard of Oz"" and the other classic Disney Films, one of the most delightful fantasy films that can be enjoyed by both children and adults.  The character of Mary Poppins was introduced and developed by P.L. Travers in a quartet of children's books.  In adapting them to the screen the writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi, skillfully choose several chapters out of the first two books and added their own inspired ideas.  The story is fairly simple, Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) responds to an advertisement by youngsters Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) for ""The Perfect Nanny"" for themselves.  Although the Banks children live a very comfortable existence on Cherry Tree Lane in the heart of London, they are starved for some affectionate attention.  Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson) is too preoccupied with his role as a bank manager whereas Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns) is a suffragette, fighting to get the vote for women.  Mary Poppins serenely sails in from the skies, and with her good friend the jack-of-all-trades Bert (Dick Van Dyke) they take the children on all sorts of wondrous adventures and nourish them with tenderness and love.  By the film's end the Banks are truly a happy family, thanks to Mary Poppins.It's magical, in all senses of the word, and transcends the generations.  I recall that very first time my friend and I laughing in delight and looking at one another in awe as one illusion after another unfolded on the screen, how'd they do that anyway?  I felt I'd come full circle the first time I watched it with my son when he was three seeing the wonder reflected in his face and hearing him merrily chortle as Mary Poppins cast her spell yet again.""Practically perfect in every way"" is how Mary Poppins is described, and I will borrow that phrase to characterize Julie Andrews' performance as Mary Poppins.  From her tip-tilted nose down to her feet spread out to form a ""v"" shape, she is the prettiest, most beguiling nanny you'll ever come across, sings gloriously and enchantingly makes the role her own.  Considered to be her consolation prize when she wasn't chosen to repeat her Broadway role in the film version of ""My Fair Lady"", she would have the last laugh come award time when she scooped not only the Golden Globe but Academy Award as Best Actress.  As Bert, Dick Van Dyke, lanky and rubber limbed is her ideal partner, they are simply wonderful together particularly in the ""Jolly Holiday"" sequence.  My wife and I thought when ""Victor/Victoria"" came to Broadway, Van Dyke should have played the late Robert Preston's role as Toddy to Julie Andrews' Victoria, it would have been a perfect reunion.  He also gets to show off his prowess as a dancer in the zany, athletic ""Step in Time"" number.  Child actors can be annoyingly arch and cutesy, but Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber as Jane and Michael Banks are refreshingly natural and winning without any irritating mannerisms.The rest of the cast is outstanding and should take a collective bow, starting with Glynis Johns and David Tomlinson as the Banks, Ed Wynn as the effervescent Uncle Albert, Hermione Baddley, Reta Shaw, Reginald Owen, Elsa Lanchester, and Arthur Treacher down to Jane Darwell's tender Bird Woman.Other reasons to see this film, first, for their time extraordinary special effects that are all the more impressive since they were developed pre computer, deservedly rewarded with an Oscar.  To give you a sample, Mary Poppins, Bert and the children popping into a chalk pavement drawing into a magical animated world, a tea party on the ceiling, and the four walking up a black staircase composed of smoke straight up to the nighttime sky.  Next a bright, tuneful score, the best ever done by the Sherman Brothers, including the Oscar winning Best Song ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"", ""A Spoonful of Sugar""  ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"", and ""Feed the Birds"".  This last was allegedly one of Walt Disney's favorite songs, and again this original score also took away an Academy Award.  The evocative sets of 1910 Edwardian London are perfectly executed particularly the Cherry Tree Lane set, and Tony Walton, the then husband of Julie Andrews designed costumes that a treat to the eye.  Again Oscar nominations for both, actually ""Mary Poppins"" received a record 13 Oscar nominations that also included Best Picture and Best Director for Robert Stevenson. One final tip of the hat to husband and wife choreographers, Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood for their exuberant dances particularly in the ""Step in Time"" number.The special features are a treasure trove of riches.  Here are the highlights: a fascinating commentary by Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, The Sherman Brothers and Karen Dotrice, ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: The Making of Mary Poppins"" -very well done indeed, a musical reunion with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and composer Richard Sherman, the gala world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theater, lots of fun to see the Hollywood A list circa 1964, a bonus animated short narrated by Julie Andrews called ""The Cat that Looked at a King"", and finally a song that was cut called ""Chimpanzoo"" performed by Richard Sherman.Last words, this restored print has state of the art picture and sound, with vivid, glowing colors and a clear, crisp soundtrack and score. I could go on and on, sufficient to say this was Walt Disney's live action film masterpiece, if you're never seen it before you're in for a joyous celebration, and if you have take the time to renew your acquaintance with this timeless classic."	5.0	"""But cream of the crop, tip of the top, is Mary Poppins and there we stop!"""	2011-07-29	1	1	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A39CX0EE4BZCZC	Craig Connell	"It took me 40 years before I finally saw this film, in December 2004 shortly after it had come out with a two-disc DVD. After the first half hour I thought, ""Wow, I can see why this is such a beloved movie"" but after that it started to lag in a number of areas and the songs were just too numerous. It seemed to go on way too long.Yet, it's a good film worthy of anyone's collection and the DVD transfer is very good: nice rich colors and reasonably sharp for a now 45- year-old film. There are some nice extras in here, too.  Andrews is wholesomely pretty and Glynis Johns, even with her strange voice, also is appealing. The kids are kind of stupid-looking, as are their parents.The other major character, the chimney sweep played by Dick Van Dyke, is a likable chap, but hard to understand with this cockney impression. However, on the DVD, one can use the English subtitles when he speaks. Van Dyke surprised me with his singing and dancing talent. I didn't know he was that proficient.The movie was one of the first efforts at mixing real life with animation and they did it well. It still holds up today."	4.0	Overall, I Can See Why This Is So Beloved	2009-03-24	2	0	2
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	"I remember seeing this on a huge screen when it first came out when I was ten years old.  It was an amazing and dazzling experience.  The mix of animation and live action was miraculous. While it is hard to understand today, the songs from the movie were actual hits that you could listen to on the radio.  Not only did we listen to them, we sang them!  Every kid had to learn how to spell supercalifragilisticexpealidocious!  We even had a game to see how many words we could spell from the letters in the word.  What a total movie experience!Seeing it again on this DVD, on a much smaller screen, was still quite amazing.  I am almost shocked how well it has held up after forty years.  Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke are stunningly good.  I appreciate the parents, David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns (George and Winifred Banks) much more now than I did as a child.  They give very fine performances.  Karen Dotrice and the sadly late Matthew Garber as the adorable Jane and Michael Banks are still treasures.  And who can forget Ed Wynn as Uncle Albert, or Arthur Treacher as Constable Jones, or Hermione Baddeley as Ellen, or especially Jane Darwell as the old bird woman on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral.The movie holds up solid as a rock.  The images, songs, dance numbers, and even the acting are all top notch and permanently enjoyable.The DVD also has some nice extras.  There is a nice piece with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, and Richard Sherman reminiscing about the movie.  Another is an extended show on the making of the movie.  Richard Sherman also performs a deleted song, ""Chimpanzoo"".  I agree that it wouldn't have belonged in the movie, but it is a charming show tune.  There are several more extras, but you get the idea.  This collection is a fine value of a great and timeless gem of Disney Magic."	5.0	Timeless Disney Magic that holds up superbly after 40 years	2005-03-27	2	2	0

Julie Andrews was superbly cast as the magical nanny Mary Poppins. From when she swoops down onto the sidewalk outside the Banks home, to the final ending when she leaves, Julie Andrews owns the screen.This film carries a powerful message about love and family, and not to waste what time you have with your loved ones. It's a potent message that if not done right, can get very preachy. Fortunately, it was done right in this film, so it's carried over beautifully. The songs simply enchant. &quot;Feed the Birds&quot; is so heart-felt, you can see why it was supposedly Walt Disney's favorite song.The film transfer to DVD is excellent, with perfect sound and picture quality. The bonus features are well-done, with a nice 'Making of...' featurette in the mix.All in all, this has to be considered the crowning achievement of Walt Disney's time with his company, being the only feature by Disney to be nominated for a best picture oscar until 'Beauty and the Beast'. Please get this wonderful film for yourself. If you haven't seen it before, you'll love it. If you have, go back and enjoy it again and again.	5.0	Practically Perfect in every way!	2002-04-02	0	0	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3006VB6TQQYQZ	Dale Hammond	One of the better comedy movies from Walt Disney.  Julie Andrews and Dick van Dyke teamed together in this laugh a secondadventure are the perfect choices.  Julie with here natural English accent  as an English nanny who seemingly, magically shows up at the Banks family doorstep, causes a never ending cascade of activities and adventures for the two Banks children.  Of course mother and father Banks, who believe their commitment in their own individual causes for the time period, end up more and more involved in Mary's influence.  Dick van Dyke, who plays a character in the movie, Bert the chimney sweeper and Mary's friend, assists with the movies grand theme, of magical activities.  The dance and comedy routines that occur in the movie with frequent regularity use Dick's comedic abilities to a full expenditure.  I don't know who were the alternate choices for Julie and Dick when the movie was being set up, but the choices having been made, I think these two were the correct choices.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A239PPUVV8O0U0	D. A. Reed	"This is Disney's best live-action/animation movie! Better than all of the studio's more recent live-action films (films based on rides are boring and shows a sign of running out of ideas. Teen musicals are a passing fad). Julie Andrews is, of course, ""practically perfect"" as Mary Poppins. Her voice is excellent on every song she's in. Dick Van Dyke is also brilliant and I applaud him on his Cockney accent. At least he tried compared to other movies that take place in another country and they cast an American (here's looking at you, the most convincing German ever, Tom Cruise). The songs are as memorable as ever. When you're older, you realize how well the songs fit and are relevant to the plot.The features were wonderful to watch (I didn't buy the previous release). And now I'm gonna sidetrack but I'll make it relevant. I'm going to New York and I was planning on what shows to see like Chicago and Mamma Mia! I was planning on doing a Disney one but Little Mermaid seems too implausible to be realized on stage (I also saw a clip of the ending somewhere and it's really lackluster compared to the film. I know it would've been a big budget thing, but still) and for The Lion King, I wouldn't be sucked into the story because I'd be totally aware I'm watching people, not animals, on stage. So that leaves the Mary Poppins adaptation. Judging from the clips on this DVD, THEY TOTALLY SCREWED IT UP! I know you need to adjust it for the stage but they changed to much and added too many new songs. ""Practically Perfect"" seems to be the only new one to fit. They put the end song of the film at the beginning of the second act and they totally eliminate Uncle Albert. They change Mrs. Banks from a woman's suffrage leader to an actress trying to please her husband! This is one thing Disney should've left as a movie!"	5.0	Another Childhood Favorite	2009-06-19	0	0	0

There is so much to love about it, it's hard to analyze it without evoking sentimental memories of childhood.While not quite in the same caliber as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, yet much better than &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, the movie does have irresistable assets: a lovely score, great sets and costumes, as well as infectious acting, singing and dancing by all the leads. The movie itself is somewhat episodic, with no real tension or conflict (unlike the tense and scary scenes of conflict in &quot;Wizard&quot;), and is about 45 minutes too long for contemporary audiences (1960's audiences didn't have short attention spans as they do today, and lumbering musicals could just take their own sweet time). Despite the accolades regarding the film's special effects, some of the blending of live-action and animation is just not on par with Disney's earlier classic &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946). Even the wires used to fly Mary and her cohorts are sometimes glaringly visible, especially on a great DVD print, not to mention in the movie theater. Perhaps some of these shortcomings caused the film to not receive mention on the AFI's 100 Greatest Films list. Nevertheless, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; is a bona fide Disney classic, with a wonderful message about life and family.	4.0	THE DEFINITIVE FAMILY MUSICAL OF THE 60's!	2001-12-20	1	1	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A8S11VP9Z36D6	"Dave ""Davelandweb"""	"Is there really much new to say about this classic Disney film that helped launch the movie career of Julie Andrews? Probably not, but for the handful of people who haven't seen this film, this DVD is a must-buy. Strangely enough, Disney is not releasing a Blu-ray version just yet, so this edition will have to tide over video buffs until that occurs. The 1964 classic is based on the books of P. L. Travers, with a few Disney liberties thrown in. Travers' nanny, Mary Poppins, is somewhat more harsh and unpleasant in the books than in the film version. However, it is obvious that she is hiding a heart of gold inside and that she truly does love the children she takes care. Two of the children did not make the transition from the book, but they are definitely not missed. Julie Andrews is able to bring out the many facets of Mary Poppins without compromising the character, and of course her voice is legendary. The Sherman Brothers whipped up some of their most memorable tunes including  ""Jolly Holiday,"" ""Spoonful of Sugar,"" and ""Let's Go Fly a Kite.""In a nutshell, the story is about a magical nanny who swoops in to take care of the Banks children, Jane & Michael, and also help their father realize what he is missing by ignoring them the way that he does. Along the way she treats the children to adventures with a street performer/chimney sweep, Bert (Dick Van Dyke) as well as her Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) who loves to laugh. One of the most memorable and touching sequences is the ""Feed the Birds"" numbers, with veteran actress Jane Darwell making her final screen appearance. One of Walt Disney's favorite songs, it is sure to bring a tear to many eyes.For those that haveMary Poppins (40th Anniversary Edition), here's what's missing on this edition:* Deconstruction of a Scene: Jolly Holiday & Step in Time sequences are examined thoroughly.* ""I Love to Laugh"" Game (not a big deal for me!)Here are the extras that ARE included:Backstage Disney* Disney on Broadway (All New to DVD)- ""Mary Poppins from Page to Stage"": The story of Mary Poppins from book to Broadway as the creative team and cast prepare to take the long running show on tour. A very well-done documentary on the stage production of ""Mary Poppins,"" detailing almost every aspect of the production that began in London. Especially interesting is how P.L. Travers did not want any ""Americans"" involved in the stage production, as she was truly not happy with what Disney did with her books. This feature takes you all over the globe: interviews with the 2 leads are held in NYC at Sardi's restaurant; an interview with one of the Sherman Brothers is filmed in Beverly Hills; interviews with the stage productions composers George Stiles & Anthony Drewe are held in England (they did a fantastic job of blending their compositions seamlessly with the Sherman Brothers' songs from the film). You'll also hear from Bob Crowley, the scenic and costume designer, detailing how he came up with the sets (inspired by the book's illustrations) and changes he made for the touring production. All in all, a very fascinating extra!- ""Step in Time"": The Broadway cast of Mary Poppins performs the number ""Step in Time"" from the show. This is a nice glimpse into the stage production. Although it doesn't quite have the pizzazz of the filmed number (what a tough act to follow), the choreography, sets, and costumes work together to create a fantastic production. Especially effective is the use of costumes and make-up to create the illusion of the chimney sweeps are in black and white, making Mary Poppins in her red dress stand out even more.- Step in Time - Downloadable MP3 featuring the Broadway cast of Mary Poppins singing ""Step in Time,"" featuring Ashley Brown as Mary Poppins and Gavin Lee as Bert.- Video Intro By Scenic & Costume Designer, Bob Crowley- Bob Crowley's Design Galleries: Concept art, costume designs, set designs and set models for the Broadway musical* Audio Commentary: with stars Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Karen Dotrice and songwriter Richard Sherman. There are a few archival comments included from Walt Disney and others. Fantastic track that really adds to the enjoyment of the film. Especially interesting is the ""Feed the Birds"" number, where Sherman talks about Mary Poppins instilling social responsibility into the children by planting the idea of feeding the birds with tuppence, thus setting off the important string of events at the end of the film. It is refreshing to hear that so many years later, both Andrews & Van Dyke (as well as Dotrice) still have a fondness for this film and the experience of making it.* Poppins Pop-Up Fun Facts: View fun-filled facts about the creation of the movie during viewing. Mirrors some of the information from the commentary track, but still enjoyable to learn some of the behind-the-scenes info as you are watching the movie.* ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: The Making of Mary Poppins"": The definitive behind-the- scenes look at how this unique and beloved film came into being.* Movie Magic: A look at the special effect techniques used to bring the magical world of Mary Poppins to life. This one is interesting, but appears to be geared more towards the young ones and early teens. Doesn't really go very deep.* The Gala World Premiere: Footage from the Red Carpet. What a feast this is; a few different rolls of film (mixing bw and color) have been edited together to recreate as much as possible of this magical evening. See Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, Ed Wynn, Cesar Romero, and so many more classic stars. Even Walt & his wife are on hand (it even appears that Walt is gently chastising the costumed Mickey character at one point).* Dick Van Dyke Make-Up Test for his role of the elder Mr. Dawes. On the commentary track, Karen Dotrice (Jane Banks) admits that during filming, she was not told that Dick Van Dyke was playing the elder Mr. Dawes. She thought it was just some old smelly man who was close to death!* Trailers, Ads and More from the Original Release and Reissue of the Film* Mary Poppins Still Art GalleriesMusic & More* Disney's Song Selection: Sing along to ""A Spoonful of Sugar,"" ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" and any of the film's other memorable songs as the lyrics pop up on screen. Each song can be selected separately or while watching the film.* Magical Musical Reunion: Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and songwriter Richard Sherman reminisce about making Mary Poppins and the music that makes it so special.* A Musical Journey with Richard Sherman: A delightful magical journey through some of the film's locations with co-composer Richard Sherman, who reveals surprising secrets about the music of Mary Poppins along the way.* Bonus Short: ""The Cat That Looked at a King"": Live action and animation based on a chapter from P.L. Travers' sequel ""Mary Poppins Opens the Door."" Julie Andrews hosts this short done in the style of the whimsical chalk drawings from the movie ""Mary Poppins."" Vocal talents of Sarah Ferguson, Tracey Ullman, and David Ogden Stiers.* Deleted Song: ""Chimpanzoo"": A reconstruction of a song that did not appear in the movie using original storyboard and concept art, accompanied by a new rendition of the song performed by co- composer Richard Sherman. Personally, I agree with the deletion of this number!Specs: Video is original aspect ration of 1:66:1, and audio is 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound with French & Spanish language tracks & subtitles. The picture, as in the 40th release, is fantastic. Colors bright, image sharp. The 5.1 mix is fantastic, especially during the musical numbers--all of your speakers will get full use! I read another review on here that only seemed to get front-speaker action, but I clearly heard music and effects loud and clear from my rear speakers, giving a very nice surround effect.There are also sneak peaks into the next Tinker Bell installment as well as other upcoming DVD/Bluray releases (Monsters Inc and Pinocchio this Spring and Beverly Hills Chihuahua)."	5.0	Great for 1st Time Buyers; extras emphasize Broadway Musical	2009-01-04	104	96	8

""Mary Poppins"" is an ingenious blend of clever visuals, song, dance, and animation.  This would all be for naught if the film were not anchored by the engaging lead performances of Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke.  Andrews' warmth just envelopes the screen and when she sings you just melt.  Andrews may have won the Oscar but Van Dyke(not even nominated!) is more than her equal.  Van Dyke proves himself here to be be an agile song-and-dance man as well as a dexterous physical comedian.  We all knew that from watching him trip over the ottoman on his TV show.  You appreciate the skill of these actors when you consider that for alot of the film they are competing for screen time with visual effects and animated images.

It was really great that she watched Saving Mr. Banks first, and then watched Mary Poppins second, because Saving Mr. Banks is about the story and the making of Mary Poppins, so it really tied everything together. I would highly recommend this movie for any parent buying for their kids, and if this is the first time your children will be watching Mary Poppins, I would definitely recommend watching Saving Mr. Banks first, and then watching Mary Poppins second, because it will tie everything together and make for a remarkable movie experience for anyone adult or child alike!	5.0	Fabulous!

Since we're going to see 'Saving Mr. Banks' on Christmas Day it will be good to see that part of the back story for this movie.This is a true classic that everyone should see at least once (I would recommend watching it every 2 or 3 years) as I consider it a Disney milestone. since I'm a HUGE Disney fan (including the theme parks!) this is really important movie for many reasons.I would rate this a perfect 10 out of 10 stars - this should be nearly required viewing for all!!	5.0	One of the best movies of all time!!!!!	2013-12-16	1	0	1

Another of special features. If you have never seen this Walt Disney masterpiece, it is a supreme treat. If you have, then you know. Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Ed Wynn, David Tomlinson, Elsa Lanchester. INSPIRED. METICULOUS. ENTERTAINING. It's the tale of a special Nanny and a chimney sweep named Bert in London, England in the year 1910. Something about her elicits wonderful things, and she and her cohorts create marvelous film fun and fantasy the likes of which you'll never forget. Lively dance animation, too. Vivid colours. Great music. Unbelievable special effects. Do you like Dancing Penguins? I do. You'll think you are a kid still. Richard Sherman and his brother composed the memorable film music. On Disc Two they take a wistful look back at the production in 1964. Both Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke reveal their nostalgic, candid experiences of movie making on the Disney set. And Wow! Enjoy the electricity of the 1964 footage of the Gala World Premiere! (missing, by the way, in the more current DVD release). This is a GEM, A CROWN JEWEL OF THE DISNEY VAULT. Watching both discs brought tears of joy to my eyes and surely it will bring broad smiles to yours.

The rest of them - however good many of them may be - don't hold a candle (on the water) to this wonderful Disney masterpiece.  This is easily my favorite Disney movie ever and one of my favorite movies of all time.One of the things I love most about this movie is the fact that there's plenty of entertainment here for children; but there's also a lot of humor for adults.  So, when the children grow up, they can have just as much, if not more, appreciation for the film.  I love the way the satire starts out.  Mrs. Banks comes home from her Sister Suffragettes Rally, shouting and singing for women's rights and equality with men(""Though we adore men individually,We agree that as a groupThey're rather stupid."").Then Mr. Banks comes home from work singing about the pleasures of being a man in this age in England:""It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910.King Edward's on the throne;It's the age of men!I'm the lord of my castle!The sovereign!The liege!""I still love the thought of a house which sports a naval cannon deck on top.  And I have to confess when I was a child I did try the finger snap to see if it would get my room clean.  (It didn't work, so I just grew up in a messy room.)The fantastic acting performances by Julie Andrews (who received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress - back in the days when the person who won was usually the person who deserved to win), the children, Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson, Glynnis Johns, Jane Darwell (though her part was very small), and the rest - cannot be overstated.  I have already said that this is Disney's best film.  Well, it is also boasts the finest acting ever in a Disney film.I highly recommend purchasing this in the Widescreen format.  You will see a lot more of the picture than in the standard format.  Unfortunately, the widescreen version is out of print (you can still buy them used; that's how I got mine); and it looks like the standard version may also be going out of print soon.  Hopefully, that means there will be a special deluxe edition with both formats, documentaries, commentaries, etc. coming out soon."	5.0	Though her words are simple and few, listen, listen...	2004-03-12	3	3	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	AOYTQFRLD8VLP	Deborah Earle	"100 years ago this spring, a magical young nanny named Mary Poppins(Julie Andrews) sat on a cloud, surveying London, and preparing to meet her next charges after receiving an advertisement they created, but which their father had destroyed.Down below, in a pleasant suburb, her long-time friend, Bert (Dick Van Dyke), entertains patrons of a park with a one-man band-performance. Sensing the impending return of his friend, he introduces the unseen audience to the tempestuous Banks household, headed by George Banks, a banker(David Tomlinson), his suffragette wife, Winifred(Glynis Johns), with two boisterous children, Jane and Michael( Karen Doctrice and Matthew Garber), and frequently quarreling domestics(Reta Shaw and Hermione Baddeley). Across the street, the eccentric Admiral Boom(Reginald Owen) keeps things interesting.An irate Katie Nanna(Elsa Lancaster), the children's current nanny, leaves after the children runaway for the umpteenth time, their latest excuse being that they were chasing a runaway kite. Mr. Banks likes order in his life, insisting that everything be in place, and his pipe and sherry be in his hand at a specific time when he comes home, and his children's needs tended to by his wife and household staff, who are to present them to him just long enough for him to ""pat them on the head and send them off to bed.""He is upset to find the children missing right around the time when he normally does that.But the local constable (Arthur Treacher) brings them home and their latest infraction leads their parents to search for a new nanny. While Mr. Banks would prefer someone solemn and cross for the position, the children write their own advertisement, for a kind, cheerful, and fairly pretty nanny who can have fun with them, and show them a bit more warmth. In reciting their preference to their father, they even point out their desire for someone who will not provoke their worst behaviors by scolding and dominating them.After they go to bed, their father tears up their ad and throws it into the unlit fireplace, where the pieces are picked up by a mysterious wind and reassemble in the hands of Mary Poppins.The next day, after another gust of wind blows away the queue of dour-looking applicants  for the job, Mary Poppins arrives with the childrens' ad in hand, much to the bafflement of Mr. Banks, who allows her to begin a trial period with the children, delighted with her initial presentation.But she promises to stay only until the wind changes...Upon entering the nursery, the young nanny almost immediately begins sprinkling stardust on the childrens' lives, removing a  plant, coat rack and other items from a carpetbag that appears too small to hold them, and with a dulcet and tuneful tone, turns cleaning up the nursery into a delightful game.Afterwards, she takes them on an outing to the park, where  Bert, now working as a screever, greets them.All four are soon magically transported into one of Bert's chalk drawings, dressed stylishly, and enjoying an outing at an outdoor cafe where  animated penguins wait on them, they enjoy a carousel ride, and their carousel horses take them to join a fox hunt, and they end up in a derby race, which a flushed Mary Poppins wins,introducing the word, ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" to describe her feelings at doing so.They are entertained by pearlies before the rain brings their festivities to an end.To prevent her charges from becoming ill from exposure to the rain, the nanny gives them medicine, and takes some herself, with strawberry, lime cordial and rum punch coming out of one bottle.Her melodious method for getting them to sleep after an exciting day is to sing a song of reverse psychology called ""Stay Awake"".The next day, the little dog Andrew interrupts their plans to go to the fish monger's by alerting them to the fact that Bert's Uncle Albert(Ed Wynn) is stuck on the ceiling  after a laughing spasm set him alight.They join both him and Bert there in a riotous episode.The young nanny's presence brings a cheerful air to the whole household, and even the domestics are on better terms with each other. Mr. Banks, however, is annoyed  by the children's constant tales of their adventures with their nanny, complaining that they are no preparation for the practicalities of the real world.After his discussion with Mary Poppins, it is agreed that the children will accompany their father to his bank. In preparation for the next day's events, they are lullabied to sleep with the story of the old bird woman( Jane Darwell)outsideSt. Paul's Cathedral.Father and son have differing views about spending Michael's tuppence: Mr.Banks believes his son should deposit it in the bank while Michael wants it to feed the birds.The elder and junior Mrs Dawes(Dick Van Dyke and Arthur Malet) are among Bank's colleagues urging Michael to invest the tuppence with them.When the Sr. Dawes takes the coin without Michael's expressed consent, we see that children will be children, and Michael fights to get the tuppence back. The commotion from the incident leads other patrons to  misinterpret the situation and there is a panic that temporarily shuts down business.Frightened by the chaos, the children bolt, hurrying into the East London slums, where, after dodging a few potential hazards, they encounter Bert, currently working as a chimney sweep. They tell him what has happened, and before he takes them home, he explains that unlike them, their father has to work most of his problems out for himself, encouraging them to have some empathy for the person whom to them, often seems so foreboding.En route to another suffragette rally, Mrs. Banks asks Bert to clean their chimney and look after the children, since Mary Poppins had a day off.Mary Poppins returns in time to see her charges get magically sucked up through the chimney to the roof, and another adventure begins.Bestriding the rooftops of London, partially by a staircase of smoke, bellowed into existance by Mary Poppins' umbrella, they eventually encounter Bert's fellow chimney sweeps, who entertain them with song and dance until Admiral Boom's fireworks chase them away.As Mr. Banks faces the possibility of dismissal, Mary Poppins makes the children give their father the tuppance.Mr. Banks verbally broods over the likelihood of shattered professional ambitions. But Bert gently reminds the reluctant Banks that his greatest legacy will be his children, and that spending time with them while they're young is also important.Heading to the bank to face the music over Michael's behavior, Mr. Banks is ceremoniously sacked from his job. But suddenly the stories the children told him about their adventures with their nanny are employed to help him through when he is asked to make a statement.The next day, while Mrs. Banks expresses her anxieties over her husband's failure to return after the previous night's appointment, her children are upstairs weeping over their nanny's impending departure.But we will soon see how, metaphorically speaking, the wind has changed for the Banks Family, as Mary Poppins departs, having indirectly influenced even the lives of Mr. Banks' colleagues, and leaving a favorable situation in her wake. And what better way to spend a gloriously windy day but by flying a kite?This intensely colorful film, a sentimental family favorite first viewed by my parents when they were newlyweds, strikes just the right balance between beautiful singing, wit, depth, and sheer joy, so that all generations can delight in this timeless classic."	5.0	Waiting For the Wind to Change....	2010-04-11	3	1	2

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2FRKEXDXDN1KI	Dennis A. Amith (kndy)	"A fantastic and magical family film, ""Mary Poppins"" continues to be a Disney classic that would win five Academy Awards and would be remembered for being a film that combined Disney's cartoon animation and real characters, the film debut of Julie Andrews but most of all, the spectacular chemistry and musical dance numbers featuring songs that continue to be classics.VIDEO & AUDIO:Mary Poppins was digitally restored and remastered in this 45th Anniversary Special Edition.  Although an older film, the remastering does look good for a film of its time.  Granted, I would love to see how this film would look on Blu-ray but  for DVD, the video looks very good.As for audio, the film's music and the dialogue comes out quite clear on my home theater.  Audio is presented in either Dolby Digital 5.1 or Original 2.0 Theatrical Mix.  The film sounds wonderful via Dolby Digital 5.1.  Music really comes alive but I didn't really notice all channels being utilized for those who were wondering but I did notice certain instruments being used in my front left and right channels of my stereo system which was nice.  But this is pretty much a dialogue and music-driven film and both come out quite clear.SPECIAL FEATURES:This 45th Anniversary Edition of ""Mary Poppins"" is absolutely loaded with special features.  Included are:Disc 1:* Audio Commentary--Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Karen Dotrice and Richard Sherman recall the making of Mary Poppins.  Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke did a commentary one one day, Karen Dotrice (plays the daughter in the film) and film and songwriter, Richard Sherman did a commentary on the following day.  Both commentaries are spliced together and done quite well.  What I found so fantastic is that Julie Andrews has not watched the complete film since the premiere back in 1964, so this was her first time watching it completely since then.  And to hear these talents just commenting on different parts of the film and what they remember of doing those scenes was just nostalgic and informative.  What a great commentary!* Poppins Pop-Up Fun Facts--Select this option and fun-filled facts about the creation of this classic film pop up during viewing.Disc 2:* Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: The Making of Mary Poppins--The definitive behind-the-scenes.  This 50+ minute featurette takes a look at how this unique and beloved film came into being.  Featuring interviews with the cast and learning so much about the film.  A great featurette.* Movie Magic--A look at the special effect techniques used to bring the magical world of Mary Poppins to life.  For 1964, to combine both animation and live action film together and create this magical world was a technical marvel.  So, this featurette was also great to watch!* The Gala World Premiere--Footage from the Red Carpet.  This was aired on television as a one hour special but the footage had been lost.  Several minutes (not the complete version) of the archived film of this premiere was found in two countries, a black and white version and color and it was pieced together to create the 17+ minutes of footage from the red carpet premiere.* Dick Van Dyke Make-Up Test - How Dick Van Dyke was made to look like the very old bank owner with make up and all.* Trailers, Ads and More from the Original Release and Reissue of the Film - From the original 1964 trailers, TV spots, Julie Andrews theater greetings and the re-issue trailers from 1974 and much more.* Mary Poppins Still Art Galleries - A lot of art was created for this film.  So, these are the still art galleries.Music & More* Disney's Song Selection--The whole family can sing along to ""A Spoonful of Sugar,"" ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" and any of the film's other memorable songs as the lyrics pop up on screen. Each song can be selected separately or while watching the film.* Magical Musical Reunion--Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and songwriter Richard Sherman reminisce about making Mary Poppins and the music that makes it so special.  A fantastic featurette especially to see them sing once more.  Fantastic!* A Musical Journey with Richard Sherman --A delightful magical journey through some of the film's locations with co-composer Richard Sherman, who reveals surprising secrets about the music of Mary Poppins along the way.  Another fantastic featurette with Richard Sherman revealing some tidbits about the songs used for the film and how Walt Disney reacted to some of the songs.Bonus Short* The Cat That Looked at a King--Live action and animation bring a chapter of P.L. Travers' Mary Poppins Opens the Door to life! Julie Andrews takes viewers into a magical animated world created in the style of the whimsical chalk drawings in Mary Poppins.  This segment is about 10 minutes long.Deleted Song* ""Chimpanzoo""--A reconstruction of a song that did not appear in the movie using original storyboard and concept art, accompanied by a new rendition of the song performed by co-composer Richard Sherman.Backstage Disney:  Disney on Broadway* Mary Poppins from Page to Stage --First a beloved children's book, then a classic movie and now a smash hit Broadway musical! Fans can follow the story of Mary Poppins from page to stage as the creative team and cast discuss the creation of the musical production and preparations for the upcoming North American tour*.* Step in Time--The Broadway cast of Mary Poppins performs the never-before-filmed number ""Step in Time"" from the show.* Step in Time - A downloadable MP3 featuring the Broadway cast of Mary Poppins singing ""Step in Time,"" featuring Ashley Brown as Mary Poppins and Gavin Lee as Bert.* Video Intro By Scenic & Costume Designer, Bob Crowley* Bob Crowley's Design Galleries--Concept art, costume designs, set designs and set models for the Broadway musical""Mary Poppins"" is definitely a true classic.  The film was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar and eventually winning five academy awards for Best Actress, Film Editing, Music Score, Music Song for ""Chim-Chim-Cheree"" and Special Visual Effects"".It's hard to believe that in 1964, there were two major musicals being created ""Mary Poppins"" and ""My Fair Lady"", ""My Fair Lady"" which eventually went to Audrey Hepburn and ""Mary Poppins"" going to the unknown actress Julie Andrews.  It was probably a blessing that Julie Andrews wasn't cast for ""My Fair Lady"" since ""Mary Poppins"" really jumpstarted Andrews career and eventually winning her the Academy Award for Best Actress.Of course, actor Dick van Dyke was popular with his television series ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" but these two talents and their musical performance were well done.  I was quite impressed by how both would nail their dances and have them in sync and Julie Andrews would comment how the most difficult part of the film was syncing their mouths to the song and making sure their foot would match for that moment.This film back in 1964 introduced a family film with state of the art technology at that time. Real life actors working together with animated humans and animals, the actors flying around and most importantly, the music that came from this film.  Classics such as ""A Spoonful of Sugar"", the award winning song ""Chim-Chim-Cheree"", ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" and ""Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)"", to name a few.  But what I discovered by watching the special feature was how important it was for Walt Disney.""Mary Poppins"" by P.L. Travers was created back in 1934 and for 20 years, Walt Disney would try unsuccessfully to get the rights for the film.  But he eventually managed to and while on one hand, really making sure the cast and the staff were well taken care of, it was quite surprising to know how much P.L. Travers actually detested the film (she wanted the animation to be eliminated).  So, there are interesting tidbits including audio that appears on the special features of Travers showing her discontent as an adviser to the film.  So, you get to learn more about this through a featurette on the DVD.  But it shows you how much Walt Disney really wanted ""Mary Poppins"" and how he tried so hard to get the rights to it.  But you really learned how much love went into the creation of this film and how much Walt Disney wanted this film to be loved.Just interesting details of how special he wanted this film, from giving people a chance such as signing Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman (the Sherman Brothers) to a contract to write and compose music for ""Mary Poppins"" (and future Disney films), casting an unknown Julie Andrews which Walt Disney loved her performance in ""Camelot"".  Disney wanted her to be Mary Poppins and despite her being pregnant at the time, he waited for her until after she gave birth to become part of the film.  Another tidbit was while meeting with Julie,  Walt Disney met her husband at the time, Tony Walton (a costume and set designer) and eventually giving him a chance to work on ""Mary Poppins"" (who also eventually inspired the Sherman Brothers for the music of ""Winnie the Pooh"").  And my favorite tidbit, of Walt Disney casting well-known actress from the early 1900's Jane Darwell in the ""Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)"" in what would be her final role, which was his way of giving her a special thank you to her for her accomplishments in film.  These are just among the few interesting tidbits from behind-the-scenes that one will learn through the various featurettes included on the DVD.As for the DVD version, there has been four previously released versions of ""Mary Poppins"" on DVD.  When Disney released the 40th Anniversary ""Mary Poppins"" on DVD back in 2004, it was hard to imagine how Disney could top that with the 45th Anniversary edition.  Surprisingly, Disney managed to pull of another spectacular release with the 45th Anniversary edition with even more special features than the original.The new feature added to the 45th Anniversary edition of the DVD  features the all-new ""Mary Poppins: From Page to stage"" which includes a fantastic documentary on the making of the Tony Award winning musical produced with Cameron Mackintosh.  Despite P.L. Travers really disliking the Walt Disney film, ""Mary Poppins"" was eventually given a musical treatment after P.L. Travers gave Cameron Mackintosh the OK but of course with certain guidelines in her will and testament before her death.The primary guideline was that a musical could be created with the understanding that only English born writers and no one from the original film production could be involved with the creative process of the musical.  The musical was a great hit in the UK but when it came to doing the musical in the US, this is where things definitely gets interesting and Disney manages to create a lengthy featurette on the process of creating the musical in the US, also a featured performance of a ""Step in Time"", an opportunity for people to download the MP3 and also a chance for people to see Bob Crowley's designs for the musical.The original film will always be magical and in the hearts of those who truly were captivated by it but this musical was amazingly done.  The costumes, the stage setup, the designs, everything looked spectacular and sure enough, the musical received rave reviews in the US as well.So, you really get all the fantastic special features from the 40th Anniversary including the bonus short animation ""The Cat That Looked at a King"" which stars Julie Andrews (and can be considered a short sequel) plus the new bonus features from the musical on this 45th Anniversary Edition.Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment managed to successfully pull of another spectacular release for the 45th Anniversary Edition.  This is the definitive version to own!  Highly recommended."	5.0	The 45th Anniversary Edition is the definitive version to own of this classic film!	2009-01-19	26	24	2

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3PPSZB0W5DZH6	"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN"""	"The 2013 movie ""Saving Mr. Banks"" offers some insights into Walt Disney's difficult dealings with P.L. Travers, the deeply damaged and damaging, tortured and tormented author of the ""Mary Poppins"" books. As ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a different movie, I won't go into it here. But, given Disney's prolonged difficulties with the prickly Mrs. Travers, it is a minor miracle that the movie ""Mary Poppins"" turned out to be an uplifting masterpiece, full of healing, hope and, yes, magic. Yes, Mrs. Travers HATED Disney and the movie. Well, Travers and her protestations be damned! The rest of the world embraced it. The 2013 Blu-Ray release looks Supercalifraglisticexalidocious, even though the Blu-Ray format and technology does reveal some of the movie-making magic tricks. But, fantasy does require a healthy, happy suspension of disbelief. And, after 50 years, ""Mary Poppins"" holds up remarkably well.Mrs. Travers' ""Mary Poppins"" books are a whimsical collection of quaint and magical short stories. But those hoping, possibly demanding,  for a literal adaptation are seriously deluded. The books have NO plot. Mary Poppins comes and goes arbitrarily. The screenplay by Don Degradi and Bill Walshe  gives ""Poppins"" a plot and a purpose. There is definitely a reason for Mary Poppins to arrive and a reason for her to leave. In between her arrival and departure, there is a profound emotional journey for audiences of all ages.True, there is more vinegar than sugar in Mrs. Travers' Mary Poppins. In a 1964 interview, Julie Andrews explained her approach to the character, ""At first, I thought I would play Mary Poppins very stiff and exactly like the books. But that didn't seem very human... so I finally decided to mix a bit of warmth in with it."" Apparently, Mrs. Travers was adverse to any suggestion of warmth whatsoever.  As portrayed by Julie Andrews, Mary maintains her aura of enigmatic mystery. She is a nanny on a mission; with a no-nonsense demeanor, crisp and efficient,  employing clever amounts of reverse psychology in her dealings with children and adults.Mrs. Travers did vehemently object to Disney's casting of Dick Van Dyke as Poppins' platonic pal Bert. Her objections on this point are partially valid. As an American in a British cast, Van Dyke, with an awful Cokney accent, stands out as the only ""non authentic""  actor in the cast. Still, Van Dyke has excellent chemistry with Andrews, playing Bert with an appropriate sense of childlike enthusiasm and wonder. He is also excellent in the exuberant musical numbers by Robert and Richard Sherman.  Perhaps to make up for his questionable casting as Cockney Bert, versatile Van Dyke also plays Mr. Dawes, the extremely elderly Senior Officer at the bank where Mr. Banks is employed.Mary Poppins literally flies down into the Banks household, and just in time. The atmosphere is complete chaos since Katie Nanny (Elsa Lancaster) quit. Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns) seems a warm and loving mother, but she is preoccupied with her political involvement with the Suffergettes. She humorously tells her maid (Hermione Baddley) after returning home from a meeting, ""Ellen, put these things away. You know how the cause infuriates Mr. Banks."" Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson) is harried and weary from his job at the bank. Quickly employing herself as the new nanny, Mary Poppins and her friend Bert take Jane and Michael (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) on magical adventures; including a Jolly Holiday inside one of Bert's sidewalk chalk drawings, and a tea party on the ceiling with Mary's giggling Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn). Mr, Banks is infuriated to  hear  of this ridiculous nonsense. Using her trademark reverse psychology, Mary Poppins suggests that he take the children with him on a trip to the bank. This sets the events in motion that will save Mr. Banks, making him a real, emotionally connected father. Her mission accomplished, Mary Poppins flies away,  in unsentimental fashion.The movie was, and remains, an outstanding critical and commercial success; nominated for 13 Academy Awards; winning Best Special Effects, Best Song (""Chimm Chimm Cherrie"") and Best Musical Score for Robert and Richard Sherman, and Best Actress for Julie Andrews. The only person who did not share in the success was Mrs. Travers, who never allowed herself to. Cold as ice  and emotionally damaged and  unreachable,  Mrs. Travers always hated Disney and wouldn't allow a moment of happiness to shine through her embittered heart.The Blu-Ray includes all The Special Features from previous DVD releases. The only section I do not like is the ""Page To Stage"" section; about the Broadway adaptation with Ashley Brown and Gavin Lee as Mary Poppins and Bert. Mary Poppins may also be in books and on stage. But the film remains Mary Poppins best and most magical medium; for only on film does Mary Poppins truly soar and fly into into all of our hearts."	4.0	"""MARY POPPINS"" BLU-RAY: PRACTICALLY PERFECT"	2014-01-22	4	3	1

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3CN9CCJUNIPKT	DJ Joe Sixpack	"I wasn't raised as a Disney kid, so I was only peripherally aware of this film growing up, maybe saw some of it on TV a time or two, but never in the movie theatres or from start to finish.Recently, however, my kid and I read the first four ""Mary Poppins"" books and were thoroughly charmed by their odd, acerbic humor. So I thought, hmmmm, maybe we should try the movie as well, even though I knew, vaguely, that the Julie Andrews MP was much different than the mysterious faerie-nanny we had come to know from the books. Although the Disney Poppins isn't entirely sugary-sweet, she is much more benevolent and feel-good than the grouchy, cross nanny in the books. Also, though I love Dick Van Dyke dearly, having his character Bert in the film from start to finish is a big change (Bert only appears in two or three stories in the books) and he often overwhelms the rest of the film.  The Banks family is also greatly altered - instead of a spaced-out humbug, the father becomes a foreboding, socially retrograde prig, while the mother (also a space cadet in the books) is made more sympathetic, a foil for the crabby dad. (And the interjection of her being politically active, as a  voting rights suffragette, seems oddly out of place: the books were never about the parents, and they are made much more central here...)There is some innovative animation and creative, imaginative visualizing of the story, but far too many alterations and new material created out of whole cloth to suit a ""Mary Poppins"" purist, which I guess I am.  Since we love the books so much, I previewed this film alone, and I think I'll hold off for a few years before we give it a whirl as a family: I really think it would ruin the magic of the Travers text, and replace it with something much simpler, much cheaper, and far less wondrous.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3GILGXGWK1IBV	"D. Mason ""Dave Mason"""	"In reviewing this 50th Anniversary Blu-ray edition of Walt Disney's ""Mary Poppins""... we'll start with the obvious.This Blu-ray format of ""Mary Poppins"" is the presentation that Walt Disney could have only imagined.  This is Disney magic in all its glory.  One tries to imagine how some future technology will surpass the clarity and beauty that unfolds here before our eyes.  It'll happen, I suppose... but it really does seem that this is as perfect as it gets.If the remarkable digital restoration of this film was the only Blue-ray feature... it would probably be enough.  This is magnificent.  The colors... the backgrounds... the special effects that mesmerized us all for a half century...  Glorious!And if anyone ever doubted the worthiness of Julie Andrews' Oscar-winning performance, one need only watch Julie's  reactions to Bert and the penguin waiters (magnificently animated by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston) as they sing and dance their way through ""Jolly Holiday.""  Absolutely believable...  Julie Andrews IS Mary Poppins... then, and always.As for the Bonus Features... it's a bit of a disappointment that the 50th Anniversary of the film didn't warrant a few more goodies to savor.  The ""classic"" features from years past are still a wonder to behold.  Even so, the repeat of the same features from the 40th Anniversary DVD release seem to this reviewer to be somewhat of a cheat.  Sadly, even Disney's official web site for the Blu-ray release seems to have no idea what special features will appear in this release.  A fly in the ointment, indeed... and an embarrassment considering the unnecessary mishandling of this world treasure.However... the ""Becoming Mr. Sherman"" featurette is more than worth the price of admission.  Just when it appeared that Richard M. Sherman had told every last story about his brother Robert B. Sherman and their work for Walt Disney... out comes this new exchange between Richard Sherman and Jason Schwartzman (who portrayed Richard Sherman in Disney's ""Saving Mr. Banks"").  The respect and admiration they have for each other is palpable and it's clear that Schwartzman was well aware that he was treading on hallowed ground in retelling Sherman's own story in this film.The film, especially in this Blu-ray format, deserves 5 stars forever... but the 50th Anniversary release does have its disappointments when one considers all it could have been."	4.0	A Blu-ray Wonder... and a 50th Anniversary Bonus Disappointment	2013-12-10	14	12	2

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A23XVF23C7BHP0	"D. M. Farmbrough ""Dave Farmbrough"""	This is great because it's in widescreen. The images are clear, the colours are bright, and this has the look of a restored version (or at least a good print). The R &amp; R Sherman songs never date and you will find modern children all over England and America singing along to Chim Chim Cheree and A Spoonful Of Sugar just as their parents did. David Tomlinson is both stuffy and loveable as Mr Banks, and Glynis Johns is wonderfully scatty as his wife. The two children are probably the least irritating in cinema history and were something of a casting coup for Disney, when compared with the horrid child actors in most of their output. But it is Dick Van Dyke who makes the film the fun it is. You can imagine, say a Petula Clark or a Diana Rigg as Mary Poppins, but only Van Dyke could play Bert the way he does. Leave aside the dodgy accent, and you're left with a great song and dance man who could carry the film even without the co-stars. The one disappointment is that there aren't any extras on this disc (I don't call scene selection a feature!).	5.0	Brilliant film, but what about some extras?	2001-11-07	3	3	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A11C43I615R52G	"Don Vito Corleone ""The Joker"""	Mary Poppins is one of my all-time favorites. Is fantastic film that is perfect in every way. the actors are excellent, the animation superb and the songs are unique. five years ago, Disney released a 40th Anniversary Edition DVD with 2 discs. It was one of the best DVDs editions that Disney had released with everything that we need to know about the movie besides the fantastic restoration of the film.This January, Disney released a 45th Anniversary Edition. While some people like me will think that was too soon for another re-release, Disney as usual, wants to gain more profits. This new DVD has the same picture and sound than the original. Nothing is shinier, crispier or anything. Is exactly the same. Disc one holds the same bonus material as the 40th Ann. Ed. Disc Two presents us Disney on Broadway, a bunch of featurettes that shows us the new Mary Poppins musical. This is completely a waste. We are concern about the movie itself not the musical so this is unnecessary. The other bonus materials are the same that the ones in the 40 Ann Ed. But, in order to put this Broadway featurerette, Disney dropped some good material about the movie that are encountered on the previous DVD. This material is: a game (not such a loss), the deconstruction of a scene featurette that was fun but most important of all, the Party where it shows the party after the preimiere of the film in 1964. What a shame that they dropped this extras to put things that have nothing to do with the film. So this is a very unnecessary DVD so my suggestion is don't buy it, and if you haven't bought Mary Poppins on DVD yet, buy the 40th Anniversary Edition which is still available and is the same price of this new Edition.	1.0	Excellent Movie, Unnecessary DVD	2009-06-11	426	360	66

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1E6JS6C205VZD	Dr. Laurence Raw	Let's face it, MARY POPPINS does have its shortcomings: Dick van Dyke's execrable cockney accent, and a narrative that tends to sprawl - especially during the last two-thirds of the movie. But such comments are essentially irrelevant in a film whose songs are instantly memorable. I defy anyone not to emerge from the theater (or from the tablet) singing &#34;Supercallifragilisticexpiallidocious&#34; or &#34;A Spoonful of Sugar,&#34; or &#34;Let's Go Fly a Kite.&#34; I defy anyone not to have a lump in the throat as Julie Andrews sings &#34;Feed the Birds,&#34; or to enjoy the sheer brio of the sequence celebrating &#34;It's a Jolly Holiday with Mary.&#34; Julie Andrews is quite simply breathtaking; one understands from her performance just how good she must have been as the original Eliza Dolittle in MY FAIR LADY (and how mistaken Jack Warner was in casting Audrey Hepburn in the film version). Van Dyke gives a jaunty performance, while David Tomlinson steals the show as Mr. Banks, the bank official who learns there is is much more to life than simply earning money. The film is the kind of thing that can be watched again and again - which is why it is endlessly repeated (and revived in cinemas as a companion-piece to SAVING MR. BANKS).	5.0	A Classic - No More, No Less	2014-01-01	0	0	0

A sweet-souled children's fairy tale disguised as a Disney musical, ""Mary Poppins"" won five Academy Awards for its songs, its then-cutting edge mix of animation and live action, and for the performance of a young Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins.Mary Poppins magically arrives at the Banks home in 1910 London to serve as nanny to the two rather neglected Banks children, Jane and Michael.  Firm but fair, the ""practically perfect"" Mary Poppins restores order to the nursery through a combination of song and magic, and begins to open the eyes of the children to the possibilities of life and their own imagination.  In company with the multi-talented chimney sweep Bert (Dick Van Dyke in top form), Mary and the children embark on a series of adventures that will end up transforming the entire Banks household, headed by a harried banker and his fervent sufferagette wife.Mary and Bert use song, humor, and compassion to set right the Banks household and persuade the parents that family comes first.  Don't miss Dick Van Dyke's uncredited performance as Mr. Banks' ancient boss.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	AA5XZVANDXGJE	"""dvdcollector18"""	I can't believe that I hated this film when I was a kid, you would think that I would have liked it more back then. But about 3 months ago, I bought this DVD and saw the film for the first time in around a decade. I cannot believe it's the same movie, in fact, I started to wonder if I was even paying attention to it back then as it was playing.The film is nothing less, and probably a lot more than a classic. Julie Andrews completely submerges herself into the character. She definitely deserved the Oscar that she got. The song's are strong, but a few stand out above the rest. Such as, &quot;supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot; and &quot;``Chim-Chim-Cheree&quot;.I hope a Special Edition DVD will be released in the future, becuase I am very interested in seeing more behind the scenes documentaries, detailing the Visual Effects that were created for the movie. The Gold Collection DVD, does offer a good documentary that gives a lot of insight, but there has to be a lot more, and I would like to see it. The &quot;Hollywood Goes to a World Premiere&quot; featurette, is a great extra.I do agree that this was Walt Disney's greatest LIVE ACTION film, but I do not think it's his greatest acheivement. That goes to &quot;Snow White&quot;, which influenced motion picture history a lot more than &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; did (and I'm not trying to lessen this film, in anyway).	5.0	Mary Poppins Gold Collection DVD	2001-11-13	7	5	2

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ	"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"It's hard to deny the charm of ""Mary Poppins,"" the enchantingly colorful movie, from an era where Disney had outstanding movies up the wazoo, rather than one every now and then. Now for the fortieth anniversary of this enchanting movie, it's been rereleased with a slew of bonus features -- and for lovers of this movie, it's worth every second.Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) have a tendency to drive their nannies crazy. So when their strict father (David Tomlinson) puts out a call for a new nanny, he's startled when only one woman comes -- and Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) answered the request letter his children gave him, which he threw away. Mary Poppins's magical talents and offbeat pals soon endear her to the kids, especially when they romp through a chalk painting and have tea parties on the ceiling.But things take a darker turn when Mr. Banks takes the children to the bank where he works (get it? Banks? Bank? Yeah, whatever). After the kids inadvertantly cause a riot, they are taken along by Mary Poppins' friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a goodhearted Cockney. And then things take an unexpected turn when Mr. Banks is in danger of losing his job, forcing him to realize what is really important in his life.Walt Disney (the man as well as the corporation) was at his peak when ""Mary Poppins"" debuted, starring rubbery comic Dick Van Dyke and Broadway star Julie Andrews. Even though the film was made forty years ago, the special effects and blend of animation and reality are remarkably fresh and undated -- from the cartoon foxhunt to the rival nannies being blown down the street by a strong wind. And the story is a timeless one -- family should come first.Surprisingly, the movie's more sober, melancholy second half makes it more palatable to adults. A spoonful of sugar may make the medicine go down, but you don't want too much sugar (ex. the cartoon chalk drawing, the goofy Uncle Albert who acts like he's on ecstacy) The fluff is toned down with the threat of unemployment and parental estrangement.What makes the bonus DVD worth getting? It seems to be mostly aimed at the target group (kids) rather than nostalgic adults -- there is a rather peculiar animated short, based on one of the Mary Poppins novels by the original author. There's also the ""I Love to Laugh"" game, which is basically answering questions to get Uncle Albert off the ceiling, a singalong, and a reconstructed concept-art song that was deleted from the final product, ""Chimpanzoo.""Fun for kids, but adults will skip right over to the audio commentary (Andrews and van Dyke) and historical reminiscing, which include a making-of featurette and a look at the musical creations in this film. A particular bonus is a reunion with Andrews, van Dyke and composer Richard Sherman around a piano -- it's just very relaxed, laid-back and well-made.One of the best things is that the entire film has been remastered. Half of ""Mary Poppins'"" charm is in the visuals and songs. So it's great to see the color and sound cleaned up and sharpened -- it has the slight fuzz of a film that needed a bit more work (or maybe that's my old TV), but overall the work is good.Forty years have passed, and ""Mary Poppins'"" charm is undiminished. So in celebration of that, the anniversary edition with all the bonus material is definitely worth getting."	5.0	I love to laugh....	2004-12-15	4	4	0

I grew up singing songs from this show, but even so I was starting to forget the absolute genius of this film.  Admittedly the &#34;Jolly holiday with Mary&#34; sequence goes on for a bit too long (they probably could have cut out either the fox hunt or the horse race) but otherwise most every scene is magical.  Dick van Dyke's performance is a tour de force and Julie Andrews is at her subtle best as the nanny who never explains anything.  Nearly every cast member could be commended for their performances, but I would be especially remiss not to mention Arthur Treacher's fine performance as the constable.  My son was able to easily pick out that Uncle Albert was played by Ed Wynn who was also portrayed the Mad Hatter in Disney's animated rendition of Alice in Wonderland.

Mary Poppins is the quinessential magical nanny, and Julie Andrews has become so identified with her performance in this film that  most people will always see her as Mary Poppins.Anyways, I recently  purchased the Gold Collection DVD of this classic movie.  It is essentially  the same as the previous Disney release except for a few points.  First,  this one actually *has* a few extras, which most of the early Disney DVDs  lacked (shame on Disney!).  The transfer is the same, but in addition, we  now have a documentary on the film, a trailer, a short premiere featurette,  and a trivia game. It's still pretty sparse as far as extras go and nothing  spectacular, but it's an improvement for Disney.  Oh yes, and there are  those annoying trailers at the beginning of the DVD that Disney likes to  put on all its DVDs.  Oh well.If you have the DVD already, don't bother  buying this one.  If you don't have the DVD, by all means purchase the Gold  collection Mary Poppins.  It's a classic film that can be enjoyed by the  family over and over again.	5.0	A classic Disney musical!	2000-07-19	4	4	0
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A13E0ARAXI6KJW	Ed Uyeshima	"That's how the incomparably magical nanny Mary Poppins describes herself with nary a boastful smirk on a revealing tape measure in this still charming 1964 Disney classic musical set in post-Victorian London circa 1910. I was five years old when it was originally released, and I managed to convince my mother to take me to see it six times. I just saw it last night for the first time in over four decades on the big screen in a sing-along version similar to what has been done with ""The Sound of Music"". I still feel a genuine warmth about this movie as an adult. Such was the impact of Julie Andrews in her big screen debut, as she epitomizes the title character with equal quantities of starch and sugar.With her unyielding posture, coltish stature and perfectly clipped diction, Andrews found her archetypal role before she even blossomed as an actress, an intractable goody-goody image she sends up mercilessly 17 years later in her husband's savage Hollywood satire, ""S.O.B."" There is no getting around the fact that she is ideal as the indefatigable Mary in charge of Jane and Michael, the two moppet children of neglectful banker George Banks and his flighty suffragette wife Winifred. With the help of devoted friend Bert, a Cockney jack-of-all-trades and one-man-band, Mary sets out to inspire the children's imaginations while keeping a firm though kind-hearted hand on their behavior. What I notice this time as an adult is how Mary wields a similarly positive influence on George albeit after much patriarchal consternation and sexist-driven protest.There are so many delightful scenes that it's hard to choose which to highlight, though one of the best ones has to be the fantasy animated sequence through Bert's sidewalk painting. This is where Bert dances with the penguins, Mary leads Bert and her charges on liberated carousel horses through a foxhunt and a horserace, and both sing two of the best songs, ""Jolly Holiday"" and ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"". Another wonderful scene is the ""Spoonful of Sugar"" room clean-up scene with obviously mechanized robins and a bevy of stop-action effects. Using an overemphatic Cockney accent as Bert, Dick Van Dyke - who was then starring in his classic sitcom - is an endearing presence and a dexterous comic dancer. He also clowns around in heavy make-up as the very aged president of the bank at which George works.David Tomlinson plays George with appropriate gruffness under his gentlemanly demeanor, while Glynis Johns lends her ingratiating quality to Winifred. The children are played without affectation by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber. Veteran character actors fill the rest of the roles expertly in what amounts to extended cameos - Ed Wynn as the eternally laughing and perpetually airborne Uncle Albert; Elsa Lanchester as Mary's frustrated predecessor, Katie Nanna; Arthur Treacher as the kindly Constable Jones; Reginald Owen as the delusional sea captain next door, Admiral Boom; Hermione Baddeley and Reta Shaw as the Banks's constantly flustered maids; and most touchingly, the 85-year old Jane Darwell (Ma Joad in ""The Grapes of Wrath"") as the bird woman on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral.The songs by the Sherman Brothers, Richard and Robert, are truly enchanting and memorable after all these years, especially the haunting ""Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)"", the wistful ""Chim-Chim-Cheree"", and the almost ""My Fair Lady""-sounding ""The Life I Lead"". I still have a few quibbles, for example, the ""Step in Time"" dance sequence is exceptionally choreographed but too darkly lit and goes on a bit too long to enjoy fully. Moreover, at 140 minutes, the movie drags a bit toward the end especially as George meets with the board of his bank. Regardless, director Robert Stevenson, who made many of the live-action Disney films of the 1960's, along with screenwriters Bill Walsh and Don Da Gradi, have concocted what has to be one of the best family-oriented confections to come out of the Hollywood studios."	5.0	"""Practically Perfect in Every Way""...Still True"	2006-02-04	7	5	2
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3C5B72J88IO3C	E. Fittin	Having seen &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; this classic film makes more sense or has a deeper meaning.  Thankfully Julie Andrews was NOT cast as Eliza Doolittle in 'My fair Lady,' a role rightfully hers!  That made it possible for her to create the role of Mary Poppins.  Dame Julie and the film are &#34;practically perfect in every way.&#34;  'Let's go fly a kite' is good advice for anyone, especially those needing a lift!

Adults folks for the Banks movie!Walt had a knack for finding great stories to put to film and this was one of his great finds. Without his personal intervention in begging Mrs Travers over 21 years this film would have not come to the screen. Even then it took all his skills to pull it off at the last minute.

I had not seen the movie in many, many years, myself, and greatly enjoyed seeing it again.I streamed the movie through the Amazon Instant Video app on XBox One, so I can only speak to that specific setup. It streamed flawlessly from beginning to end, and I was actually amazed at how instantly the stream started. There did not seem to be a buffer period.

It was great to snap your fingers and have all your toys and mess glide to their place.  It was wonderful wishful thinking!.  As an adult I can say the following:  It is still a great movie but a bit antiquated.  Too much singing although the songs are classics and it was great to hear them again.  I did not understand the very looooooooooonnnnng chimney sweep sequence.  It was grueling.  Make a long story short.  I watched it almost to the end and then stopped 20 minutes short.  The movie is too long, too much singing and cheesy for today's world.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3FHSLWEMH7JD8	"Elizabeth G.

Julie Andrews' glorious voice, and hilariously ironic, deadpan portrayal of the magical nanny, have boundless appeal.Other characters are no less engaging: the troublesome Jane and Michael, Glynis Johns as the suffragette who deals with the Edwardian &quot;age of men&quot; on the home front, Ed Wynn bringing &quot;class&quot; to a tea party on the ceiling. Dick Van Dyke would make anyone hope to turn the corner and meet Bert - the stage performance would top that of the West End.The story is great fun, acting and music first rate, and the situations the type that make one wish one could join in, popping into pavement pictures for sheer enjoyment.	5.0	Best in kid-flicks	2001-08-17	1	1	0

Mary Poppins was always one of my favorites as a young girl &amp;  now my son can enjoy it as well.  The DVD does have some extras to speak  of.  Although I haven't seen them yet.  Only because everytime we put it in  we just start watching the movie.  What 15 month old cares about extras?  I  would definately reccommend this to anyne who has children.  They will love  it.

Do you want to watch something funny with animated penguins that serve breakfast to you? If this sounds interesting to you, you should watch Mary Poppins!!!!!!Mary Poppins might be the best movie we&#8217;ve ever seen! We recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. This movie is hilarious! There&#8217;s a talking umbrella, singing animals, a horse that falls into the river and all the other horses stomp on his head, and turtles that carry Mary Poppins across a river. There&#8217;s a great scene with chimney sweepers that jump out of chimneys singing. Another reason we like this movie is because it has really amazing music all through the movie! We really recommend you listen to &#8220;A Spoonful of Sugar&#8221; if you haven&#8217;t heard it yet. Another thing is that Mary Poppins is a movie that was made 50 years ago and it&#8217;s still great! It&#8217;s a classic, brilliant movie that all generations can enjoy! This movie is appropriate for all ages, it&#8217;s non-violent, and it has a very positive message about the importance of change, imagination and magical fun!	5.0	First Graders Love This Movie!	2014-03-05	1	1	0

No one can deny the beauty of this wonderful story. I can't think of any other Disney movie more worthy of a high-definition transfer.The Banks family is searching for a new nanny after the children scare off their last one. The ad is answered by charming and whimsical Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews). She brings the troubled family together with the help of her chimney sweeping friend Burt (Dick Van Dyke) and a cast of magical characters that inhabit different fantastic worlds.A solid digital restoration breathes new life into &#34;Mary Poppins&#34; for its 50th Anniversary Edition. The colors are vibrant and the picture is crisp and clear. Some will no doubt complain that it's a little too cleaned up, but you can't please everyone. If you want the film preserved the best way it can be right now, this is a must-have.&#34;Mary Poppins&#34; 50th Anniversary Edition is presented in 7.1 DTS HDMA. It's safe to say that no one has ever heard any of the wonderful songs or accompanying sound effects the way they're presented here. Every jolly tune surrounds the viewer in a cloud of joy and delight.Bonus material for &#34;Mary Poppins&#34; 50th Anniversary Edition includes some fun items. Actor Jason Schwartzman interviews Composer Richard Sherman about the movie's music in the all-new &#34;Becoming Mr. Sherman&#34; featurette . It also contains Mary-Oke Sing-Along, &#34;The Making of 'Mary Poppins'&#34; featurette, a deleted song, and a musical reunion between Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, and Richard Sherman.Any fanatical Disney enthusiast needs to update their home entertainment library with the &#34;Mary Poppins&#34; 50th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A12WZTC4YJ8ZEC	Ethan D Van Vorst	"At one point near the beginning of ""Mary Poppins"", the character of Bert, played by Dick Van Dyke, looks upwards at the heavens and contemplates aloud, ""Winds in the east, mist coming in, like somethin' is brewin' and bout to begin. Can't put me finger on what lies in store, but I fear what's to happen all happened before."" Yes Bert...the winds carry the stench of ""Revolution"". Che Poppins, affixing urban camoflauge paint to her face in a cloud not far overhead, only needs the wind to change direction before she officially brings her own brand of childcare carnage to the big screen.We're soon introduced to the Banks family, living in the upscale suburbs in turn of the century London, England. Dad is a capitalist and entrepreneur, battling daily doses of smog, mutinous home workers, and a wife deeply involved in an underground anti-government organization, all the while bringing home the bacon and trying to keep his home ship-shape (his neighbor takes that phrase to a whole new level). But Papa Banks also has two impressionable offspring, both intent on driving their daycare workers to the brink of madness. They too have demands, which they list clearly on a manifesto brought forth and read aloud to the governing parties of the house regarding any future nannies: ""You must be kind, you must be witty. Very sweet and fairly pretty. Take us on outings, give us treats. Sing songs, bring sweets"". Clearly the equal distribution of sugared confections is a high priority here.Enter Mary Poppins, part witch creature, part guerilla warlord, she descends upon the Banks home in a well placed para-drop and singularly blows away (literally) all the competition with efficiency that any syndicate overlord would admire. Market saturation obviously is of no consequence to her and within moments of destroying the competition she has asserted herself to Mr. Banks and appointed herself as Nanny Overlord of the Banks residence. Soon afterwards Comrade Poppins sets up shop in the children's part of the house and instructs the children on ways to better serve the State. And it starts by cleaning up one's room.The children are introduced to ""everyman"" Bert, a man who changes jobs each day in an attempt to avoid the government from learning his whereabouts. Whether Bert is belting out songs of The Worker's Struggle, selling low-end kites to the proletariat, or scrawling subversive images into the sidewalks of London, it's clear that he has an agenda, that being to destroy the moral fabric of upstanding, law-abiding families. Bert's fight against City Hall comes to a head when the next door neighbor, Admiral Boom, representing the military-industrial complex, collides with the ideologies of Bert and his comrades. Specifically Adm. Boom launches a gunpowder-laden sneak attack on Bert and his friends at a Chimney Sweep Union meeting, setting in motion the final act of The Great Peasant Uprising. Mr. Banks, now bereft of his job thanks in large part to ""Politburo"" Poppins' anarchist child-rearing methods, now has no income and cannot even afford to feed the birds. Nor can he spare tuppence a bag. He spends the much of the rest of the film hiding in the basement, much as Lenin's foes did. And if Banks is one of the foes, then Poppins is Trotsky reborn, shuffling out of the movie with no warning and with only an eerie promise of returning soon, perhaps in time for the next revolution. And then the concerned viewer is told to go fly a kite. How cheeky!The extras DVD contains interviews with the principal actors and actresses, behind the scenes looks at the actors in action, the how-to's of 1960's special effects, the stories behind the songs, and much more. There is a commentary track by Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke to watch with the movie, if that's your thing. Interesting to know that the robin which Mary Poppins sings to was actually run by thick cables which had to be carefully hidden from the camera by Julie Andrews and resulted in a whole lot of shot retakes. If musicals are your thing, then Mary Poppins will be your thing."	4.0	Mary Poppins: Vanguard of Socialist Nannies	2009-03-18	8	7	1

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	AOZ80EILRHVUJ	"Everett Green ""Inverto-Guajardian Music Thera..."	&quot;Mary Poppins&quot; remains the ultimate Disney musical that both entertains and, in a lighthearted tone, sends a sweet message to children and grown-ups alike. This might sound melodramatic, but anybody who has gotten so deep into the &quot;9 to 5&quot; work routine to the point that they miss the &quot;here and now&quot; could totally relate to this fine work!Such a passionate statement rings true in almost any age; &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; is a wake-up call, a scathing assault on the mindless conformity that runs rampant in any modern society. I can't hum &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot; without also thinking &quot;Protagasubterfugerist et antiphlogistic!&quot; Cheery tunes about nonsensical words indeed mix with angry Greek slogans demanding that the apathetic sloth we call society be energized with the inflammation that is the rising public anger latent in a hollowed culture.Credit for the swift delivery of prosaic force that drives home this angry attack on modern corporate society should go to director Robert Stevenson, who directed many popular Disney films. &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; is a departure for Stevenson; unlike his &quot;nuclear family&quot; hits like &quot;Son of Flubber,&quot; this body of work reveals a brave soul letting out a Guajardian cry for help. This is most abundant in the melodic tune of discontent disguised as joy &quot;I Love To Laugh,&quot; a symbolic parody revealing that laughing at jokes rife with dark humor spears our souls with a hallucinatory effect, delivering us to heights we may never return from, all while the impoverished starve and the farm animals sicken in the fields. Guajardian musical lyrics have never been better!I can't help but believe this film was a cathartic exercise for Stevenson. Unlike his feelgood movies, this is a focused and consistent work. There is only one other Robert Stevenson film I can think of where he seems to cut deep with his personal creative punch. That 1971 work parallels &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; with its upbeat sardonic songs, but also effectively utilizes surreal gothic imagery, chilling Wiccan chants and disturbing apocalyptic overtones. And while that particular film, &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks,&quot; delivers an almost Warholian assault on fascism, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; reigns proudly as the pinochle of Robert Stevenson's body of work.	5.0	Classic Disney musical score blends with great storytelling!	2001-09-03	0	0	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1S31XLRRB11US	F. Adcock	"This is the third DVD release of the Disney classic, and the studio's current technology has given us a print that probably looks better than it did in 1964 - not a scratch to be found anywhere.  The first DVD release presented a copy of the movie that showed little or no remastering at all, with a faded image and sound to boot.  Everything looked and sounded much better in the second release, the first to use 5.1 audio. But anyone watching the present DVD for the first time should appreciate all the work done during the immaculate restoration.  The image is incredibly sharp, bringing out even the smallest freckles on Julie Andrews' face.Audio selections are varied on this new disc, including a French and a Spanish track, and three English tracks.  The sound is a marvel in 5.1 Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix - what a treat!  However, this ""Mix"", and the 2.0 version of the mix, sounds somewhat blurred when heard on TV speakers.  A good test is when the chorus enters during the main title sequence, singing ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"".  Normally, the chorus is up front and focused, but with the Enhanced Mix on TV they tend to be behind the already distanced orchestra.  For TV speakers only, viewers are encouraged to choose the Original 2.0 Theatrical Mix, which sharpens the sound considerably.Extras are very fun and informative.One of the best DVD's of the year."	5.0	Mary Poppins - All Spruced Up	2004-12-29	6	6	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	AHBE4D7UG8742	Gabriel H. Jennings	I see potential here, especially in Julie Andrews.  She has a fair voice and rosy cheeks.  Her dancing is impressive.  Her costume, especially the bonnet, is lovely.  The make-up, however, could be improved--too much soot on the forehead!  Is unbecoming for a lady.The two little twerps, in comparison, give dismal performances.  These two youngsters will need tremendous coaching, teaching, and molding if they ever hope to be stars, or even mature adults.  All of this bedwetting must end.  Unacceptable.  And Michael is too short for a boy of his age, stubborn, and suspicious.  Furthermore, the children exhibit poor manners, especially the character Michael, played by Matthew Garber, who causes a run at the Fidelity Fiduciary Bank, an unprecidented event since the Boston Tea Party.Finally, although Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins has perfect posture and speech delivery, some of her methods are quite unconventional.  For example, it is quite inappropriate to approach an important job interview by umbrella.In sum, although Julie Andrews gives a commanding performance at times --> truly molding the British breed, at other times her lessons appear quite silly.	5.0	Julie Andrews has potential!	2013-11-13	4	0	4

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV	"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"""	"Created in a series of novels writen by P.L. Travers between 1934 and 1952, Mary Poppins was originally described as an eccentric battle ax with magical powers--and Travers was in no great rush to let her popular character go into the movies.  When she finally agreed, she was horrified with the result, despising virtually everything about the movie.  She was, however, in a distinct minority.  Produced by Walt Disney Studios, MARY POPPINS was the number one box office hit of 1965, receiving spectacular reviews and picking up an Academy Award for star Julie Andrews in the process.The plot is a mixture of the first four Travers novels with a bit trimmed here and bit added there and a number of tweaks along the way.  Set about 1910, the story concerns the Banks family.  Father George (David Tomlinson) is preoccupied with his job at the bank; mother Winifred (Glynis Johns) is preoccupied with the suffragette movement.  As such, they tend to neglect their children, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber), leaving them with nannies that the children run ragged.  When the movie begins, the latest nanny (none other than Elsa Lanchester) resigns in a huff--and the next day, under significantly mysterious circumstances, a new nanny applies for the post: Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews.)  Together with her friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke) she takes the children on a series of extraordinary adventures than range from jumping into chalk drawings to having tea while floating in the air to wild dancing with chimney sweeps.  In the process, she reunites the somewhat fractured family.The story is extremely episodic, but it is well done, extremely whimsical, and the script is often unexpectedly clever.  The music holds everything together.  Everyone is sure to have their own favorite song, with ""A Spoonful of Sugar,"" ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,"" and ""Let's Go Fly A Kite"" extremely popular.  My own favorite in the score is the delicate, beautifully performed ""Feed the Birds.""  The film also has a number of cameos, including Hermione Bradley, Reta Shaw, Ed Wynn, Jane Darwell, Reginald Owen, and the aforementioned Elsa Lanchester, all of them charming.  The major cast is also quite good, and if Dick Van Dyke's accident seems to come and go in strange ways, the chemistry between him and Julie Andrews more than makes up for it.  The movie is very specifically a ""sound stage"" movie, and the special effects are distinctly of the 1960s, but no less charming for that.  If the movie has a flaw, it is that it seems a little too long.There are several different DVDs of MARY POPPINS, so the bonuses vary, but from what I can tell most editions will have at least a commentary track and a ""pop up trivia"" feature.  In any case, the sound and film elements are excellent.  Is this a great movie?  Well ... perhaps, perhaps not.  But I absolutely defy anyone to watch it without smiling.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"	4.0	Practically Perfect In Every Way	2013-07-21	1	1	0

There you go.I must have only seen ""Mary Poppins"" when I was a little kid because I only barely remembered the movie when I was watching it and definitely didn't remember the plot. Definitely an experience worth having, whether you've seen it once, or many, many times.The basic plot is that two kids have been a real terror to their nannies, but not so much out of meanness as the nannies' domineering personalities. They draw up a list of their needs for a nanny and when the wind changes, Mary Poppins comes, despite their tight-laced fathers' wishes. They're soon off on fantastical adventures that may just change the lifestyle of their entire family! This movie makes important comments about suffrage, structure, and just finding the joy in life. It's supercalifragilisticexpealidocious! (And I didn't even have to look that up!)The movie is presented in wide-screen with fully-restored, bright and colorful animation and practically perfect sound. There's also both a subtitle and a close-caption track, although oddly these differ greatly in what they do and don't pick up on. I ended up keeping on both.Like other recent Disney Platinum releases, this DVD contains a wealth of special features that will help you to enjoy the movie more. Chief among them is a great deleted song. You also get a complete making-of feature, a look at the movie magic, a game, promo posters and trailers and many other simply delightful goodies.Like the ""Aladdin"" release, this release is loaded with both a commentary track and pop-up fun-facts. If you actually decide to watch all of this stuff, you'll end up having seen the film at least three times by the time you're done!So what are you waiting for? Go off now and buy this!

It's a very humanistic, loving film, but love that has a backbone (snip-snap, as Mary poppins says). It's sweet, silly, touching and still holds up very well technically. I never fail to get a kick out of Ed Wynn (in his last movie role, the father of now deceased as well Keenan Wynn) and the tea party on the ceiling. It's an ideal antidote for the blues ... and those corny old vaudville jokes Dick Van Dyke and Ed share up there ... great fun. The message ""Let's go fly a kite"" -- to take some time off and enjoy life is more relevant today than it was then.

I had the LP and knew all the words and sang them so much it must have driven my family bonkers. And my children also loved this movie and I bought a copy as soon as it became available.Julie Andrews won an Oscar for her portrayal of the irrepressible nanny, Mary Poppins who brings a carpetbag of magical adventures into the lives of the Banks family on Cherry Tree Lane. With a dazzling blend of animation and live-action, and an award-winning musical score, this is a must for children and the young at heart. This is a timeless classic, that children centuries from now will still enjoy.	5.0	A True Classic.	2001-01-19	2	1	1

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A7Y6AVS576M03	gobirds2	This is probably one of Walt Disney's best films, if not the best. It is the most excellent realized combination of live action and animation. It  contains eternal charm, wit, and magic as it introduces us to the  &quot;practically perfect&quot; nanny who brings profound change to the  Banks family of London in the early twentieth century. Every song composed  by Richard and Robert Sherman is pure magic. The believable visual effects,  the heartfelt scripting, and the solid performances by Julie Andrews and  the heart rendering Dick Van Dyke are truly eternal. Every element of  production came together at their zenith to create a treasure of cinematic  endearment. The DVD is excellent. The supplemental material is very good  and nostalgic. One of the best films ever made. The superb cast also  includes: David Tomlinson, Glynis Johns, Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher,  Ed Wynn, Hermione Baddeley, Reginald Owen and Jane Darwell as The Bird  Woman. Director, Robert Stevenson is at his best.	5.0	Mary Poppins on DVD	2000-08-17	24	22	2

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2MXYKNXQEPTFX	GodzillaFan2005	"When I was a little kid, I couldn't get this film at all, but when I heard many positive reviews of this film, some saying that it was the best Disney film ever, I decided to give it another shot. So, I bought the DVD, and now, it's starting to grow on me! I now fully agree that this is the best Disney film I've seen! It's no wonder this film won 5 Academy Awards! Songs like ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"" ""Spoonful of Sugar"" ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" will always get stuck inside your head!This will always be Julie Andrews best character, no matter how many films she makes. She does a perfect job with Mary Poppins, and yet, she can really sing! No wonder she was that good in Broadway! I believe Walt Disney made a perfect choice to hire Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins!Dick Van Dyke ROCKS! He's really funnier than ever, playing as Bert, and yet, he's also a great dancer! I really laughed when he laughs in different stages during the scene with Uncle Albert. Another perfect selection made by Walt Disney!The Special Effects were PERFECT! I've learned that Cherry Tree Lane was actually in the indoor stage, but I thought at first that it took place in London! It's no doubt the best set I've ever seen. Also, I was really surprised when they wanted this to look like a Broadway stage! I really thought they succeeded in doing that when they were doing the song, ""Step in Time,"" which had really perfect energy, and there were no accidents, which really amazed me! I was also impressed that when the Nannies were blew away by a strong wind, and Mary Poppins flying to and from the Banks' house, or all of the Uncle Albert footage, or all the scenes in which they fly, you CAN'T see a SINGLE wire! The fireworks sounds were perfect on the 5.1 mixed edition! I can go on and on, but I'm all out of ideas!Behind the Scenes and Trailers were a perfect help for the Disc 2 edition. It also has a new short called, ""The Cat that Looked at the King."" While having an okay title, this short was very good. It would be a shame that it would not win an Oscar.I give this movie a solid +10/10I give this DVD a solid +10/10 for having a perfect video and audio presentations! The video was so enchanting, that I couldn't see a single scratch! The audio was amazing, but I'd stick with the 5.1 mix!Get this DVD for not only the kids, but for the adults too!I'm sure that everyone around the world will find this movie and this DVD, ""SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS!!!"""	5.0	Practically Perfect in Every Way!	2004-12-30	3	3	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3FBTJCCNQXW2U	Goldenroom	"Absoloutly innocent and adorable fun that the whole family will love. With the cartoons, jokes and classic songs, this is a film that kids to great grandparents can watch and enjoy equally.There is so many great and important lessons too in the film. One such lesson is in the song ""feed the birds"" which teaches the importance of caring for all living things. Personally I get a warm and ""in touch with Earth"" feeling when I feed a deer, duck, etc, etc... Another great lesson comes from Burts job as a chimney sweep. As he and the children look out through the rooftop view of the city, burt tells the children how only the birds, planes and chimney sweeps get to see this view everyday. Its an important lesson to see the bright side of things even in the worst of situations. That is only a few of the great messages this movie delivers.Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews are amazing in Mary Poppins and show great chemistry. You can really tell how much love they put into this masterpiece.The DVD quality is amazing. Im a bit dissapointed that there is no extra cartoons with this one, but the movie is more then enough fun."	5.0	Mary Poppins ~DVD~ Julie Andrews	2003-03-14	1	1	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2UBSGFCP2QFNV	"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'"""	"When we recently went to see Walt Disney's landmark 1964 musical fantasy transformed into a Broadway musical, I approached it much the same as when I first saw ""Superman the Movie"" in 1978. The earlier version was such a part of so many lives it seemed inconceivable that anyone could make it work as a live musical.Superman managed to succeed beyond expectations, and so does ""Mary Poppins"" on Broadway. The movie and the show are related yet compliment each other. Not an easy task.How this was accomplished is chronicled in a new documentary on the new two-disc ""Mary Poppins 45th Anniversary Edition DVD.""The original stage stars, Ashley Brown (who knew she wasn't really English?) and Gavin Lee discuss the process from audition to production, along with the talented artists who brought Poppins alive on stage.Well worth the DVD set alone is the ENTIRE ""Step in Time"" show-stopper filmed right from the stage, complete with one of the most talked about marvels in the show: Bert's miraculous dance around and over the stage proscenium. Lee explains the evolution of the stunt in the accompanying documentary.We also were able to glimpse one of the sweeps in ""Step in Time,"" the immensely talented Sean McCourt, who plays several roles in the stage Poppins as he did for years in Wicked. We were fortunate enough to learn of his contributions from a backstage Wicked presentation he hosted with equally gifted colleague Anthony Galde, who still plays multiple roles in that show.The most warmhearted and reassuring thing about the new 45th Anniversary bomus material is the generous attention afforded to the cooperative relationship between Richard M. Sherman and the new songwriters, George Stiles and Anthony Drewe (Robert Sherman's health prevents the activity).And while you may think it's a no-brainer that Mr. Sherman was included to some extent, consider that after the duo successfully wrote songs for The Tigger Movie, they were summarily replaced for the next Pooh film. In the case of Poppins, clearly every courtesy was accorded the score and the two legends who created it. It's especially wonderful to see all three songwriters on screen, two in England, one in California, singing together.For even more detail about the story of the ""Poppins"" flight from book to screen to stage, take a look at the massive and beautiful book co-written by expert historian Brian Sibley, ""Mary Poppins: Anything Can Happen If You Let It.""Magnificent stage artwork from the stage version rounds out the new bonus material on the recent DVD, for the info of those who have the earlier versions. Most everything contained in the 40th anniversary edition is still here except for a game and a piece-by-piece reconstruction of a ""Jolly Holiday"" excerpt.But it still includes the wonderful audio commentary with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and Richard Sherman -- and who wouldn't want to ""watch"" the movie with them? My only quibble: a guide folder to the discs would have been nice.And if you still have the single-disc Gold Classic edition, you may want to keep that one because it's the only one with the complete ""Hollywood Goes to a World Premiere,"" a short theatrical film with delightfully cheesy narration (""the vivacious Annette!"") as well as the after party audio material. The newer two releases use this footage for a similar bonus, but it's nice to have the original.(By the way, the connection between ""Superman"" and ""Mary Poppins"" may have seemed a strange juxtaposition, but both of them not only can fly, but they spin around real fast, too!)Whether you feel the new release is worth your while or not, I am pleased to see ""Mary Poppins"" reissued as often as possible. This is a very important film, not a relic of the past, and reissuing brings it to the public's attention each time and hopefully introduces it to another legion of fans. Here's to keeping everything higgledy-piggeldy around here!"	5.0	"Well worth it, if just for ""Step in Time"""	2009-02-02	2	2	0

Dick Van Dyke and ensemble, not to mention Julie Andrews, who I believe is so credible as Mary Poppins, and she's so likeable, laughable that it's a shame that no other movies came along with her, but that was before sequels.  I'd say that this is at the top of the heap of all the best and the brightest of movies.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!  And after you've seen it, you'll all want to ""...go fly a kite,"" as the song said.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	AZCP0POER0SUY	"Gryphonisle ""in a bamboo hut"""	"I first saw this film in the theater, on it's premiere.  If I'm not mistaken, it was a very early multiplex in Los Angeles.  Of course I was captivated.  I saw it again, over the years, on T.V., ""Wizard Of Oz"" style, with commercials, although the ads never seemed to attach themselves to film the way they did with the ""Wizard"", where I can still identify the scenes where the commercials are due.Then, as I grew up, and older, I aquired a more jaded view of ""Mary Poppins"", and ignored it for more than a decade.  And, fairly recently, I happened upon ""Mary Poppins"" on T.V., and realized that my memories were not accurate.It was not the repulsive '60s musical, ala ""Sound Of Music"", with the obnoxiously blonde, dreadfully perfect, aryan, children; but a wonderfully escapist piece, with bytes of subversiveness, referring to suffragettes, and a woman's place in Edwardian society, and what they were doing about it;  a subversiveness that ""SOM"" completely lacked, even with it's much darker Nazi overtones.  Can I strangle those brats with the drapes, now?But lately, in watching the film, I notice that Cherry Tree Lane was all too awfully, a harbinger of the banal suburban housing tracts that dominate our lost farmlands and suburban sprawl, today.  One can see the imprimatur of Disneyland, and Disneyland Culture, all over this film, except that, when it debuted, this clarion call was not a part of the film that any, but the most clear headed, and most strident activists would have picked up.Oh my.But don't let that deter you, this is a wonderful film.  This is a product from an era when Disney was a film maker, and not the metaphor of all that went wrong with American society.  It was, after all,  our fellow Americans that took the message to heart, and made a mess out of it.  Don't let them screw it up for you.I highly recommend this film for escapist entertainment, and I won't even feed a pidgeon, even in the company of children! (They're wild animals, like the Parrots of Telegraph Hill, and Chicago...)This is a fine film.  Watch it."	4.0	Aged well, entertaining, pertinent tie-ins to our modern life	2005-07-20	4	2	2

But I bought this VHS because the DVDs are more pricier than other DVDs of other movies, other DVDs can sometimes be found at a good price, but Mary Poppins can't. But as the movie goes, you can't lose when it stars Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. They sing and dance, and entertaining whole family, plus movie has special effects. Plus, you get to know the origin of that long word, &#34;super-whatever,&#34; that I don't know how to spell.

I think of days spent with my brother jumping off rock ledges with umbrellas in hand and hours passed wishing to have a magic nanny just like the practically perfect Ms. Poppins for my own.With a combination of live action, animation, and song, ""Mary Poppins"" keeps the eyes of audiences of all ages glued to the screen. Nominated for a phenomenal 13 Academy Awards (and winning 6), this film (along with 1967's ""The Jungle Book"") kept Disney's doors open through the difficult times following Walt Disney's death. The Sherman Brothers' songs are perfectly suited to the film and will keep you humming along long after the movie has ended.Julie Andrews gives a tour-de-force performance as the titular nanny. It is hard to believe that Disney was criticized for selecting such a newcomer who was unproven at the box office. Incidentally, this is the same reason she was overlooked for the role of Eliza Doolittle in ""My Fair Lady,"" a role which she had already essayed very successfully on the Broadway stage. She *is* Mary Poppins just as much as she *is* Maria in ""The Sound of Music"" the following year. I simply could not imagine anyone else in the role.Dick Van Dyke is terrific in the role of Bert, the jack of all trades, despite having a somewhat-less-than-convincing Cockney accent. He is humble, entertaining, openhearted, and fun all around in his performance. ""Step in Time"" is a charming dance number made fantastic by the physicality of Mr. Van Dyke and his supporting chimney sweeps. What energetic youngster wouldn't love to dance like that? He is also very touching in the scene with Mr. Banks/David Tomlinson. When he sings, ""And when your little tykes are crying, you haven't time to dry their tears,"" I inevitably find that my own eyes are welling up.Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber are lovely as the two ""adorable"" children, Jane and Michael. David Tomlinson is appropriately stuffy as Mr. Banks while his wife, played by Glynis Johns, is appropriately flighty. Their transformation during the film is truly magical. In essence, that is what the entire movie is about -- the ineffable magic of childhood. What adult doesn't need to be reminded of that from time to time? It's just all too easy to get caught up in the rat race of day-to-day existence. It's interesting to me that Jesus said that you must have the heart of a child to enter heaven. That is a sentiment truly worth pondering.ABOUT THE DVD: This widescreen version features an excellent transfer of sound and video.DVD Features:Available Audio Tracks: English, French or SpanishThe Making of ""Mary Poppins"" featurette is wonderful and reveals a great deal about how the film was made.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3E2PIFDDI3SLT	"H. F Merritt ""howmer1"""	"I hadn't seen ""Mary Poppins"" since I was a teenager, but for years afterward I reviled the movie, specifically due to Dick Van Dyke's role.  I'd considered his portrayal of Bert to be unfocused, and his faux-Cockney accent went right up my back every time I heard it.  Recently, however, we purchased a DVD copy of the movie for our two-year-old, who insists upon watching it several times a week, thus forcing me to watch it as well.  And after dozens of repeat viewings, I can honestly state that my original assessment of the film and its actors was dead wrong.  ""Mary Poppins"" is absolutely brilliant, the kind of film (cliche coming) ""they don't make anymore"", a wonderful family film filled with heart, great animation, and wonderful songs.  It is rightly called Disney's crowning achievement.  And Dick Van Dyke is excellent, acting in his greatest film roles as Bert and Mr. Dawes.  A superb song-and-dance man with great comedic timing and a way of mugging for the camera without actually appearing to do so - if Van Dyke had lived in the era of the great MGM musicals of the '30s, we would probably be celebrating him today, and not Fred Astaire.  Most of the rest of the cast are outstanding as well.  Julie Andrews - well, what more can I say about her?  A well-deserved award.  David Tomlinson is equally is good as Mr. Banks - the look on his face after Bert's gentle admonishment, when his children show how much they love him by handing over the tuppence . . . that part always gets me.  The only character I have problems with is Glynis Johns - sometimes she looks as though she wishes she were in another movie, especially in some of her scenes with Tomlinson.  But overall, a great, classic film that has withstood the changes in tastes (when was the last time they made a musical?) and the test of time."	5.0	After Reconsideration, A True Gem!	2002-08-26	0	0	0

I so appreciated the creativity of the story (jumping into chalk drawings, riding carousel horses in a derby race, laughing yourself up to the rooftop, nannies being blown away by the wind) and the slower pacing (current movies are overwhelmingly frantic by comparison).

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3IXZJ1L73DYTA	Jack E. Levic	"For some reason, MARY POPPINS is a movie I have avoided through the years. I knew many of the songs and references to the film, but I never had a desire to see it. It seemed like it would be silly and cliche. Finally, I took the leap and began watching MARY POPPINS. For a while, I was sure I had been right through the years. Who cares about the Banks family and the cold and aloof Mr. Banks and the rather scattered Mrs. Banks? Because Julie Andrews literally lights up the screen as Mary Poppins, I kept watching. Her remarkable voice is a true gift and I could start putting songs I have heard into context.Enter Dick Van Dyke as the seriously miscast Bert. His fake Cockney accent was irritating and I just could listen to his voice. The story chugs along in its silliness. Then something truly magical takes place. The story and the characters come together and in my opinion, it begins when they make an emergency visit to the ""ailing"" Uncle Albert played by the one and only Ed Wynn. Uncle Albert's illness? He loves to laugh and the more he laughs, the more weightless he becomes and he floats to the ceiling. His joyous laughter becomes infectious and soon Bert and the kids are floating with laughter much to the chargin of Mary Poppins. Here was the turning point and the rest of the film seemed delightful.Walt Disney's mix of live action and animation was ahead of its time. He was always the innovator and I can only imagine how the eyes of young children lit up seeing this magical spectacle on the big screen in 1964. Long before computer animation, special effects were created by hand. Dick Van Dyke's dance with animated penguins is a charmer. It's Van Dyke's physical comedy that fills the screen. Forget his fake cockney accident, just relish with delight his long-legged rubbery figure as he cheefully makes his  way across the screen.There could not have been another actress more perfect for the role of Mary Poppins as was Julie Andrews..lovely and young and beautiful, her songs are full of life and zest. No nonsense ""practically perfect"" Mary Poppins puts on a serious face but you know she loves the Banks children and her roll in bringing the family together. Stern Mr. Banks melts into joy with his children and Mary Poppins brings the family together.We never know why Mary Poppins has magical powers. Even Bert seems to have magic in him. Mary flies over the streets of London with her open unbrella. She makes it all look effortless.MARY POPPINS was off to a slow start with me and I went with the flow and was led into a delightful fantasy.

It's got songs, dancing, laughing, crying, animation, live action, special effects, great acting (minus Dick Van Dyke's attempted `cockney accent'), and a great story.  What more can be said?

I remember as a child when I had the chicken pox over christmas break, and I must have watched this movie a hundred times.  The story is wonderful, and in my opinion even though it is often times lumped in with family movies instead of musicals, it has to be one of the best musicals ever made.  Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke were made for their roles.  The little children were wonderful as well.  The supporting cast is made up of the Walt Disney stable of actors that he used over and over again, but you really don't notice because they are all such good character actors they make their parts real to the viewer.You will love the animated scenes and the fox hunt is just crazy!This specific DVD version is the best because the behind the scenes stuff and documentries are great as they explain the animation, and how they painted the beautiful london cityscape on glass.  The Disney fanatics should also buy this as they will get a special peek into the Disney movie machine that isn't usually shown on camera.On my personal top list of all time I rate it #15So get this movie and watch it again and again and again!	5.0	Mary Poppins is Supercalifragilistic....  uh? well you know!	2006-01-24	4	3	1

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	APF9MW1YUQMKO	James V. Ruocco	Julie Andrews won the 1965 Academy Award for Best Actress in this delighful musical adaptation of the popular British children's books. And deservedly so. From the moment she descends from the sky as Poppins and lands on the front steps of Jane and Michael Bank's home, there's absolutely no stopping her. Here, as in the many films she would make over the next five decades, Andrews graps hold of a part, takes it that extra mile and never once disappoints.  As Poppins, she is magnificent. But there's more to the part than just singing about tea parties on the ceiling, popping in and out of chalk pavement pictures or spoonfuls of sugar. Sure, she's the nanny we'd all love to have. But in the story, her character arrives just in the knick of time to put a dysfunctional family back together in true Disney fashion. The songs are great. In particular, &quot;Chim-Chim Cheree,&quot; &quot;Spoonful of Sugar,&quot; &quot;I Love to Laugh&quot; and &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpalidocious.&quot; The rest of the cast, Dick Van Dyke, Karen Dotrice, Glynis Johns, David Tomlinson, Matthew Garber and Ed Wynn, also add to the fun. Hard to believe that it's been 37 years since this film was first released. Nontheless, it's just as entertaining as it was way back when. It's also fun to sit back and watch a whole new generation of kids and their parents discover the magic and wonder of this terrific Disney film. Rent it today. Or Buy it. You won't be disappointed.	5.0	It's a Jolly Holiday With Mary	2001-06-27	13	11	2

Don't you have eyes you stupid woman! Without Julie's outstanding performance, your character would be boring, nasty and ugly like she was in your books. Although i have to agree with her on Dick Van Dykes performance as she wanted to re cast the character of Bert as she thouht he was nothing like her Bert in her books, she's right.But really, this movie is a CLASSIC and has hardly any faults.  Though did you know that Glynis Johns (Mrs Banks) first thought Walt Disney was to cast her as Mary Poppins and when he told her that was already cast to THE Julie Andrews, she was angry and so only agreed to do the picture if she had a song as she felt Julie Andrews was taking all the songs in the picture, well theres only one thing to say to that and that is JULIE CAN SING, YOU CAN'T!!!!The DVD has a wonderful little extra of the actual premiere of Mary Poppins which i found very interesting and also gives you a little featurette on the actual special effects. The picture is crisp and clear and the colour is vivid.So Spit Spot!

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A28ERDII8FZQQ9	J. Daniel	This is my favorite musical of all time. It's wonderfully done, and the story is excellent. Julie Andrews did a great job in her first ever cinematic role, she plays a magical nanny that comes to a rich man's house in order to bring the family back together. What I love about her performance is that she looks very confident and so straight forward and firm, not as playful as you may think. The film also has Dick Van Dyke in the role of Bert, who is a very good friend of Mary Poppins and also handles magic very well. That role was funny and very entertaining(the accent is a bit confusing though), and i loved all of his dance numbers, especially Step In Time, the dance on the roof-top. Another excellent performance was David Tomlinson, who did the role of George Banks, the father of the children. He is very firm and strict, but he can also be very clumsy and forgetful, which is another reason I liked him. His song The Life I Lead was also great. This film was prized with five well-deserved Academy Awards, for the excellent Film Editing, the Visual Effects, like the jump into the pavement picture, the tea party on the ceiling and the smoke ladder, the excellent score, the song Chim Chim Cheree, which may have not been the best song, but one of them had to win, and last but not least, the excellent (oscar-winning) performance by Julie Andrews.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2K4HN6EECBNR3	"Jean Baldridge  Yates ""jean, jewelry designer..."	"We here at home love this 40th anniversary edition of the film, Mary Poppins! It is spectacular! I adored the books when I was a child. My older sons loved the original Disney movie on video, and this DVD is being watched with the greatest delight by my younger children! With good reason! Even though this is an extremely long movie by present standards, it moves right along, is packed with fantastic, classic songs, amusing scenes, and even touching, poignant parts which will move you, zinging straight to your heart.Julie Andrews, who rightfully won an Oscar for her role as the magical nanny who appears at ""just the right moment"" at the door of the discombobulated British Banks' family's household, teaches the children and their parents as well a thing or two about how to live properly. It's complicated to say what ""living properly"" means, exactly, unless you watch the movie...It has much to do with having fun as you do things you ought to be doing. It has to do with caring for other people's feelings, and also for taking a day off when you are least expecting to and having a fantastic adventure! The songs ""Spoonful of Sugar"", "" Let's Go Fly a Kite"", ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"", ""Feed the Birds,"" and Chim-Chimminee"" are all so famous and so beloved it is quit easy to call up their tunes at a moment's notice, I expect.  If you haven't heard them lately, I suggest you get a copy of this really well done 40th anniversary edition and relive the first time, or times, you saw this movie. It is touching, and charming. Dick Van Dyke is fantastic as the appealing foil to Julie Andrews' character. You can tell Mary Poppins  adores him in his character (Bert, the chimney sweep) but must maintain her ladylike character -- it is truly sweet. Another charming and superbly played  part is that of Ed Wynn's in the scene which includes the song ""I Love to Laugh"". That is a great scene in every way! Incredible!The children and their family are beautifully cast; the ups and downs are believable, and easily coax you into caring about the plot. The movie is extremely well rounded. There is dancing, singing, and fantasy galore.  I cannot recommend this 40th anniversay version of Mary Poppins highly enough. I don't care how old you are! You will love this movie!"	5.0	P.L.Travers' Book, Mary Poppins,  Made Even More Magical, if Possible!	2007-09-22	2	2	0

I will do my best to explain why it wasn't ranked higher.  First is that we liked 22 other movies better.  Secondly, if I could edit out about an hour of this movie, it might well end up in the top 10.These assessments come from my children, who found that while they enjoyed much of the movie, sometimes the theatrical parts were to long and drawn out and just plain boring to children.  Watching real people right poorly drawn merry go round horses for 5 minutes sends them out of the room every time.  Watching the chimney sweeps dance for 5 minutes does the same.  It also seemed like the songs they liked were to short and the songs they didn't like were to long.We had a lot of fun by gathering the family together to rank the 41 Disney movies we have that include some cartoon work. All the kids, ages 6 to 27, participated along with mother and dad. Lion King was selected number 1 of the 41 as the family favorite, but narrowly. Peter Pan was 2. Pete's Dragon 3, Beauty & the beast 4, Sleeping Beauty 5, Snow White 6, Robin Hood 7, 101 Dalmatians 8, Fox and the hound 9, Cinderella is 10th, Rescuers 11, Hunchback of ND 12, Aladdin 13, Aladdin King of Thieves 14, Jungle Book 15, Little Mermaid 16, Hercules 17, Winnie the Pooh 18, Rescuers Down Under 19, Sword in the Stone 20, Pinocchio 21 and Mulan 22.	3.0	A spoon full of editing makes the movie move along	2003-08-11	11	3	8

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3QTP2CI1BDV0M	"Jim O'Brien ""JamesMark"""	"This is a great movie ... maybe the perfect movie, in that it is entertaining from beginning to end, the story is easy to understand and take a personal interest in, the bad guys are never too scary, and the ending could not be happier.The morals too are right ... children are more important than adults, the family is more important than the job (or cause), and good behavior is important, but so is having fun.I think it is fair to say that ... the better a movie is, the more times we will watch it.  And Mary Poppins ranks high in that department.  All the different parts (the acting, the wonderful songs, the animation) seem to come together perfectly, and the final product is, well, ... practically perfect in every way.Thank you Walt Disney for giving us this movie.A FEW WORDS MOREI recently got the 40th anniversary re-issue, and it is well worth buying ... especially for any ""Mary Poppins"" fan.  The quality of the extras is a little up and down, but we get the movie (and that's a lot) and the ""Making Of ... "" extra is excellent.A lot of people do good work for ""Mary Poppins"" and it's hard to pick one who might be called the MVP of the movie.  Robert Stevenson has an excellent eye as the director, Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi give us a wonderfully well thought out script, the instrumental arrangements for the songs and background music for the whole movie (done by Irwin Kostal) are excellent, Peter Ellenshaw does all those beautifully realistic background paintings (I love the one that opens the movie best), the Sherman brothers give us 13 great and memorable songs, the choreography (by Dee Dee Wood and Mark Breaux) is imaginative and fun, and the actors and actresses all do a great job (even the pigeons do a good job).  Glynis Johns is fun as Mrs. Banks ... funny in just about everything she does.... and there's Walt.  His guiding hand ensured that we got a perfect ... or practically perfect ... movie to be enjoyed for generations.But I think I would have to choose ... the Sherman brothers (as MVPs).  Those wonderful songs are ... more than anything else ... the engine that makes the movie go (especially for repeated viewings).  Also, they (the Sherman bros.) helped write the screenplay (uncredited) and came up with many of the key ideas that comprise the story.  Plus, Dick Sherman plays the kazoo in the penguin scene.FUN LINES FROM THE MOVIEMrs. Banks:  I don't think we need bother the police dear.  The facts of the matter ...Mr. Banks:  Kindly do not attempt to cloud the issue with facts.--Jane Banks:  Wanted:  A nanny for two adorable children.Mr. Banks:  Adorable.  Well that's debatable, I must say.--Bert:  Now's the time Mary Poppins.  No one's lookin'.--Mrs. Banks:  As a matter of fact, since you hired Mary Poppins, the most extraordinary thing seems to have come over the household.Mr. Banks:  Is that so?Mrs. Banks:  Take Ellen for instance.  She hasn't broken a dish all morning.Mr. Banks:  Really.  Well that is extraordinary.----NICE LITTLE TOUCHESJane and Michael are usually made to speak ... alternatingly.  Jane will say a sentence, then Michael will say a sentence, then Jane, then Michael.  It fits very nicely into the movie.The children are (a couple of times) made to be peering through the banister posts ... a nice touch.Jane, after measuring Mary Poppins, is seen rising up.  Somebody had to think of doing that, and it works nicely.After Mary Poppins returns the robin to the outdoors, she closes the cutains, and a slight breeze is then seen blowing the curtains inward.  A nice little touch.In the cartoon sequence, one of the baby swans is made to do a sort-of spazmatic little swim.  A nice touch, I think.After singing ""Feed the Birds"" Mary Poppins gently brushes the side of Jane's head.  A nice little touch.When fleeing from the bank ... out the door ... the edge of Jane's is seen as the bank guard grabs for her.At the end of the movie, while starting to fly their kite, Jane is made to be holding the forefingers of her mother.  A nice little touch.TRIVIA QUESTIONWhen Mary Poppins (and Jane and Michael) meet Bert in the park, and Bert outlines Mary Poppins' silhouette, .... what time is it?(answer)It is nine o'clock.  A clock can be heard chiming in the background, and it chimes nine times.A CURIOUS THINGLate in the movie, when Ellen (the maid) dances up and says ""It's the master!"" there is a black object on her shoulder.  It looks like a black glove, and I wonder why they had it there."	5.0	It Would Be Six Stars...If	2005-01-22	4	3	1

I loved it so much, I begged him to sit through TWO more showings! He must have liked it too or just wanted to give my Mom some ""alone time,"" because he agreed to watch it two more times.My own daughter loved it as much when she was a little girl so it has a special place in my heart! The high quality of clear definition to the images is fantastic (you can actually see where Dick Van Dyke's bald cap is when he's playing the old bank president, Mr. Dawes). The sound and color are so vivid - they must have really worked some Mary Poppins magic to bring such clarity and color to this 45+ year old film!My family loved reading all of the pop-ups that gave us little trivial insights into the actors, scenes, costumes, etc.,  This is a beautiful family musical that is just as entertaining today as it was over four decades ago. It's no wonder that it received 13 Oscar nominations and won five including Best Movie and Best leading Actress (this went to Julie Andrews and Mary Poppins was her first starring role).I read that the 45th anniversary edition had less on the movie and more on the recent (Broadway) stage production so I'm glad I ordered this edition.

Nothing wrong with that when you can pop in one of the most cheerful children's classics ever. (Even grownups love the music--ok, admit it, you do.) The songs are brilliant, Julie Andrews sings like an angel, and Dick Van Dyke was a stroke of genius as Bert the chimney sweep--as lucky as can be!Other than the risk of hearing &quot;supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot; to excess around the house after playing this film, what's not to like? The funny thing is that the movie is not exactly true to the more acerbic style Poppins of the P. L. Travers novels (she was NOT all sweetness and light, just read it.)

It is a mixture of live action and animation and is a wonderful musical and is quite possibly the perfect family film.  Nominated for 13 Academy Awards and it was the winner of 5, including Best Actress for Julie Andrews in her feature film debut.""Mary Poppins"" is the story of, well, Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews).  Mary Poppins is the new nanny for Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Matthew (Michael Garber) Banks.  As a nanny, Mary Poppins is ""practically perfect"".  She floats down from the sky holding on to an umbrella and convinces George Banks (David Tomlinson) to give her the job as the nanny.  George is flustered by Mary and of course he gives her the job.  The lives and experiences of the children are about to change because there is something magical about Mary.  With a song and a dance amazing things happen around Mary.  She can clean up a room with nothing more than a snap of the fingers and can take a journey into a picture drawn with chalk on a sidewalk.""Mary Poppins"" perfectly mixes animation (the penguin waiters!) and live action to create a magical world that is an incredible change from the London that Jane and Matthew think they know.  There are excellent acting performances and the over the top Dick Van Dyke is charming in how sweet he is.  The whole movie is sweet, charming, funny, and fantastic.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A168VXSISJWQN9	"John D. Muir ""oldies and pies lover"""	First let me say that I like this movie. I'm British by birth so I am duty bound to deduct one star for the most unsuccessful attempt at a British accent ever to be immortalized on film. It shows how much the standard of acting has improved when you hear the flawless British accents of actors like Rene Zellweger or Johnny Depp. Dick Van Dyke simply can't do a British accent and should never have been cast in the part. There was a British actor/singer at the time called Tommy Steele, who already had an impressive stage and screen resume and who would have been perfect in the role. However, he was overlooked for the bigger name (in the US) of Van Dyke. Ironically, Julie Andrews was passed over a year earlier for the movie of 'My Fair Lady' for the non-singing, but better-known, Audrey Hepburn (whose cockney accent was almost as bad as Van Dyke's). Andrews showed what a mistake that was by winning an Oscar for this film. However, that quibble aside, this is a joyous, entrancing movie.The funny thing I referred to in the title of this review is that in most movie adaptations of books, like say the Harry Potter series, angry reviewers spend much time and energy complaining that the movies don't follow the books. Hardly anyone (I did find one such review) says that about 'Mary Poppins', even though the movie bears little resemblance to the book and, in particular, the character of Mary Poppins is completely changed.Personally, I've never felt that movie adaptations need to follow the books on which they were based. Movies are a totally different medium and the only criterion should be whether the movie works as a movie. In that respect, 'Mary Poppins' works admirably.	4.0	It's a funny thing...	2010-08-24	6	3	3

Veteran troupers Ed Wynn, Reginald Owen and Arthur Treacher lend colorful support, and Van Dyke is an appealing song and dance man, though his Cockney accent fails him.

It places values on family that lack in the upbringing in moral fiber these days and teaches values that a nanny rarely teaches our current children of today with the exception of hola due to parents working there children's lives away in pursuit of money and Capitalism.  So please sit down with your own family and cherish feeding the birds or going to fly a kite or spending time with them before time spends you.	5.0	Its Disneys best...and it takes you to Disneyland everytime you watch it...	2007-07-19	2	2	0

I was &#34;privileged&#34; to be able to watch it between 80 and 90 times while it was in its first run. It never ceased to make me smile and sing along with &#34;Supercalifrafilisticexpialidocius&#34; and &#34;Ster in Time&#34;. Watching it again now, brought back those memories and rekindled my enjoyment of the whole experience.	5.0	Timeless Entertainment.	2013-04-12	0	0	0
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	AA3EC3LKOBD80	Jonathan Cohen	"""Mary Poppins"" is one of those classic musicals that you probably loved as a kid, then think you outgrew- until you show it to your own kids (or yourself) and happily sing along. That's what I found on viewing this Disney masterpiece for the first time in decades. The fabulous Julie Andrews- already a Broadway/ West End star, and here an Oscar winner right out of the gate- became a beloved institution as the world's most famous nanny. Dick Van Dyke was already a huge TV star before he shined here as Bert the chimney sweep/sidewalk artist/one-man band, weird Noo Yawk-cockney accent and all. A host of Brits both veteran (foppish David Tomlinson and vibrant Glynis Johns) and young (the button-cute Karen Dotrice and the late Matthew Garber) fill out the excellent cast, probably the best in any live-action Disney movie before or since. Look for Van Dyke in his Rip Van Winkle getup, too, as what his old boss Carl Reiner might have called ""the 2000-year-old bank president"".The Sherman brothers would score many more Disney and related family movies, but never came close to the joy of this one. With its distinctive Olde English lilt (music-hall, military marches, Gilbert and Sullivan), the music did a huge part to make ""Mary Poppins"" the treasure it is: ""Spoonful of Sugar"", ""Jolly Holiday"", ""Chim-Chim-Cheree"" (an Oscar winner on its own), the still-haunting ""Feed The Birds"" and, of course, that busker-flavored number with the 34-letter title...oh, dear, what is it? ""Super-Calabogus...Super-California...got it! Docious-Ali-Expi..."" Never mind. If you don't know this song, don't bother reading any further and go back to your ""adult"" fare.I'd forgotten about the animated sequences and art work that combined with the superb settings and wardrobe (designed by Julie's then-husband) to give ""Mary Poppins"" its authentic atmosphere and feel for Edwardian London. Disney had a couple of house Brits- director Robert Stevenson (""Swiss Family Robinson"",""Treasure Island"") and artist Peter Ellenshaw (his gorgeous title painting of Olde London Towne)- who really did transport you back in time along with the cast and songs. The animation isn't exactly Pixar-style, but the soft-color, old-school Disneylook is just right for the carnival/teatime/race course ""Jolly Holiday"" sequence, penguins and all.The bonus material, as you'd expect for a true classic, is superb. We learn from the documentary feature (almost an hour in itself) that Disney pursued the movie rights as early as 1938. You might say it was worth his wait! Just about all of the surviving principals are part of the extras and commentary, which include two delightful musical segments with songwriter Dick Sherman. One of these brings back Julie and Dick to reminisce and sing their songs- most warmly indeed. On his own, Sherman reveals the inspiration for the tunes (""Step In Time"" was adapted from the music-hall dance tune ""Knees Up Mother Brown""). There are moving moments, too: Sherman on how ""Feed The Birds"" moved Walt like no other song; a still-girlish Karen Dotrice, long-retired from acting, breaks down when she tells of co-star Matthew Garber's death at 21 and Walt's own passing two years after ""Poppins""' release. Not many movies can stir such emotions, happy and sad, 40 years on- this one does. Finally, as with many Disney (and Pixar) DVDs, there's an animated bonus: ""The Cat who Looked at the King"", adapted from a later P.L. Travers story, a cute little cartoon fable featuring great voice work by Tracey Ullman (as a white kitten with a moral) and David Ogden Stiers (as know-it-all Old King Cole).Whether you have children or not, it should be a must to watch ""Mary Poppins"" at least once a year, as not only a great piece of true family entertainment but a reminder of how both Disney and Hollywood really did care about quality movies for ages 3 to 93. A wonderful package for a wonderful musical- the kind you know they don't make any more. Highly recommended!"	5.0	JOLLY GOOD AFTER ALL THESE YEARS!	2005-08-08	3	3	0
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A30QIRX0TROA6A	"Jonathan Green ""defrocked cultural anthropolo..."	Given that the movie is wonderful, perhaps the last of the great Hollywood musicals and a charmer for all generations, this DVD is still remarkably wonderful. Disney has done a clean-up job on the film that makes it shine. The audio is rich and wonderful, including the all-important ORIGINAL stereo soundtrack (feh to multi-channel remixes!). The special features even manage to elucidate the process of filmmaking in manner intriguing to both the cineaste parent and Mary-mad children.Though my TV screen is significantly smaller than 1964 theater screens, I can't imagine that Mary Poppins looked or sounded any better when it was new.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2WVTRNQMUW1HX	"Jonathan P. Saltzman ""bookdesign"""	"With this new 2-disc release, Disney Studios finally ""got it right.""  Kudos to the technical specialists who cleaned up the animation sequences and the soundtrack irregularities that have plagued every release of ""Mary Poppins"" ... until now! The 5.1 Surround Mix is superb and the sound engineers have equalized the voices during the songs that contained dialogue that was dubbed into the sequence, so now it is hardly noticeable. The Disney Home Theater Stereo Mix is even better than the original stereophonic theatrical release. It was just thrilling to watch the opening credits and see the actual care and love gone into cleaning up the original artwork.  Here is a Textbook Example of how to digitally restore a movie without destroying it (are you listening, George Lucas?).A technical note: This edition is listed as being widescreen (1.66:1) whereas my 1998 edition of ""Mary Poppins"" listed a screen ratio of 1.88:1.  Whichever it is, it is the same screen ratio as the 1998 edition (thankfully).""Mary Poppins,"" in my opinion, has always been the best film Walt Disney ever produced, and the care he took in producing it is evident in the casting (especially the cameo roles). Robert Stevenson's direction is classic and unobtrusive; the editing is well-paced; the cinematography perfect.  It is no wonder this film won 5 Academy Awards, mostly for technical achievements and the music, and of course one big one for Best Actress to Julie Andrews in her film debut!"	5.0	"""Mary Poppins"" on DVD is Practically Perfect in Every Way!"	2004-12-16	3	3	0

I watched it again and though it is not something I want to watch everyday, like The Sound of Music, it is an alright film that people can live through. The songs are really wonderful and touching.  The children are very cute even thoguh at times they lack the personality of some other children from one of Julie's other movies made a year later.  I think of this movie kindov as a stepping stone to greatness for Julie because this movie was the precurser to the good things to come in &quot;The Sound of Music.&quot; I would recommend if you want to see a really flawless musical about a nanny watch &quot;The Sound of Music.&quot; It is onehundred times better.  Mary Poppins however is good in its own right.  And one more thing.  All the people who continue to whine that Audrey should have gotten the Academy Award instead of Julie need to get over it.  Julie was just as deserving and MFL won for best piture so you really should jsut stop complaining.  Audrey is a good actress, but let me remind you Julie's performance was superior because she acted, sang and danced and did all of them well.  Also compared to Julie's performance on Broadway, Audrey really stunk in MFL.  Audrey got her fame from doing a lot of alright movies, but let me remind you that Julie Andrews were always be remebered for her great performance in Mary Poppins that made the movie.  And for the one movie that will live forever &quot;The Sound of Music.&quot;	1.0	It was better the second time	2003-12-30	117	3	114

The 40th has lovely video/audio ('fully restored original 1.66:1, 5.1 audio), and extras as follows: bonus short (animated), musical reunion (Sherman,Andrews,VanDyke), 'Super...'(making of M.P.), audio commentary, Poppins pop-up funfacts, orig. 2.0 theater audio.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1BUCXZTW926PL	Julia Walter	"We watched this as a family on New Years Eve before we will see ""Saving Mr. Banks."" My daughter had never seen ""Mary Poppins"" before. I hadn't watched it for decades. (I *loved* it when I was a kid.)But I don't think it aged well. Many of the dance and singing numbers were about twice as long as they should have been. The chimney sweeps dancing on the roofs was exciting, but also felt like it went on *forever.*  ""I Love to Laugh"" is delightful, but again too long. When the children, Mary Poppins and Bert step through Bert's chalk art is at once gorgeous, but again, the sequence is waaay too long. I saw the play ""Mary Poppins,"" a Broadway touring company, in 2012 and didn't think any of these things. In the movie they make fun of Mrs. Banks as a suffragette, in the play/ musical she is more sympathetic.  Similarly, the class distinctions are more sharp and used for laughter or poignancy more effectively in the play.On the other hand, Julie Andrews is *wonderful* in this. She sings so sweetly! Dick Van Dyke is great, even if his accent is terrible, it's part of the fun. He seemed to be channeling Stan Laurel. The children and the other actors are great. The music and story is pure fun.I'm glad we saw this and I'm glad we watched it together, --mostly, my daughter stopped watching after an hour or so.

Decades later, I had to watch it as an assignment for a class called Innate Abilities - about activating our human DNA to open to our inherent capacities as a embodied and turned on human in all her glory.  I was blown away even in the first 10 minutes of the film.  My heart exploded as I realized the depth of message and nuance of beauty underpinning this film..

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1N2L9A6I686G5	"Katie ""book worm"""	"Although I am in my mid-thirties now, I still remember my family watching this movie TOGETHER every single time it was shown on t.v..  I capitalize ""together"" because, even back in my day, everyone was so busy that to sit together for anything was a major feat - and I truly cherish these times with my parents.Mary Poppins is a wonderful musical that is appropriate for everyone - regardless of your age.  The songs are so upbeat & fun that you'll find yourself (and everyone else watching) tapping their feet and singing along.This movie is about a family in need of hiring a new nanny for their 2 children because all of the other nannies were scared away by the jokes these kids played on them.  In reality, the children are really in need of a bit more love & attention from their parents, and are acting out in an effort to get rid of the nannies so that their parents will start parenting them themselves.This is where Mary Poppins comes in...  She is the one who's hired for this job, and she is able to give the children a sense of love & peace like they'd never known.  She also has some ""special powers"" that enable her to create fun out of anything!!!Julie Andrews & Dick Van Dyke are absolutely amazing in this movie!  They both have such a stage presence, and they mesh perfectly together.Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals, as well as those who are looking for a great movie for ""family night"" - I'm sure it will be a hit with everyone in the house!"	5.0	One of the Best Movies Ever Made!	2005-08-20	2	2	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3OLNBFLTQ3PZI	Katrelya A. Angus	C.S. Lewis believed that a story worth enjoying at 10 is worth enjoying again at 50.  While I do enjoy my childhood favorites: Gone With the Wind, Little Women, and Lewis' own Narnian series, I believe I can lower the age limit and say that a story worth enjoying at 3 is worth enjoying again at 50.  I loved Mary Poppins when it was first released in the theatre, but love it more now with my adult eyes and ears.Mary Poppins is a warm happy tale, but there is also a definite conflict with a strong protagonist: Mr. Banks and pair of antagonists: Mary and Bert.  Together the boyfriend/girlfriend duo of a chimney sweep and nanny assault Mr. Banks' cold harsh sensibilities like a blow torch and teach him that compassion and joy are far more valuable than financial gain.I found the extra pieces in Disc 2 very informative, and they left me wanting to see the stage show.  However, like Karen Dottrice (Jane), I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of the endearing young chap who plays MIchael.The only flaw I saw in the movie then, and now, is that there is not one shot of Mary's beautiful long dark hair down.  If Mary's room is right off the nursery, a shot of her getting up to get Michael and Jane a glass of water (or telling them to quiet down for the night), with her hair in a braid, or completely down, like that of a faerie tale princess,  as she teaches Jane proper hair care, would make Mary more realistic, while at the same time enhancing the charming magic of this timeless tale.When I was a wee damsel, I only had one word for the first movie I ever saw in my life, and that word still holds true:Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!	5.0	Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!	2011-06-30	0	0	0

This time they have included nearly an hours worth of additional material documenting the wildly successful broadway production.

I haven't watched Mary Poppins for ages and decided to buy it since it's such a Disney classic.  Disney is even releasing a movie about the making of the film starring Tom Hanks as Walt Disney.  Sadly, it'll be ages before I ever watch Mary Poppins again. It seems like every bit of the over 2 hour length. And I personally, enjoy longer movies when the story is so good it makes the time go by quickly. But Mary Poppins does not and is a basic story line connect with long musical numbers.	3.0	Nice Musical, but Entirely Too Long	2013-12-16	10	1	9

It was nominated for a staggering 13 Academy Awards in 1965 and proceeded to win 5 including: Julie Andrews for Best Actress in a Leading Role; Peter Ellenshaw, Hamilton Luske and Eustace Lucett for Best Effects, Special Visual Effects, Cotton Warburton for Best Film Editing, and Richard B. Sherman and  Robert B. Sherman for Best Music, Score - Substantially Original, as well as Best Music, Song. It also won a number of other awards including Golden Globes, Grammys and BAFTAs. Dick Van Dyke, who unfortunately didn't receive an Academy Award nomination, was nominated for the Best Actor award in the Golden Globes, but was unsuccessful.Julie Andrews is Mary Poppins who, by unusual circumstances and highly original transportation, arrives at 17 Cherry Tree Lane to take up the role as nanny to Jane (Karin Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber) who are the children of banker George Banks (David Tomlinson) and his suffragette wife Winifred (Glynis Johns). Mary Poppins, together with her friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a local street musician and chimney sweep, proceeds to take the children through a magical journey. Along the way she teaches George something about his values, and what the truly important things in his life are.Mary Poppins showcases excellent performance by all the leading players, and is a classic movie by any standard.	5.0	Truly Magical!	2004-12-25	3	2	1

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	ABHBURBXUZFF8	Kurt Miller	"1964 was a very strong year for film, Becket, The Fall of the Roman Empire, My Fair Lady and Mary Poppins just to name a few. (I am not too fond of My Fair Lady but I would by no means call it a terrible film.) So far I have seen three of the Best Picture nominees--Becket, My Fair Lady and Mary Poppins. My Fair Lady and Mary Poppins swept up most of the trophies while Becket snunk in between them and got one. Personally, I think Becket was the best of the bunch but then again quality is subjective and the Academy is mostly a popularity contest. Perhaps since this was the year after the Great American Tragedy, the audiences found light hearted musicals a more welcome escape from reality than a serious costume drama tragedy.Some critics tend to dislike musicals because ""It's one song after another. It's getting annoying. Just cut to the chase! Get on with the plot!"" My response is ""Uh...guys...It's a MUSICAL!"" Mary Poppins is definetly one of the strongest of the genre. Sure it's not without shortcomings. The 'outside' scenes are obviously not really outside and some scenes go on too long like the laughter sequence and carousel race, but it's an absorbing film filled with great songs and dialogue (mostly from Mary herself) crackling with wit and spark.I have always loved Julie Andrews. She works wonders with whatever role she plays. She may not be for everybody--hard to believe--but she certaintly has a very distinct signature persona. And of course she could sing. If I wouldn't have given her the Best Leading Actress Academy Award she won, it is not due to any percievable flaw I find in her performance but simply because Maria in The Sound of Music is a more complex role. Mary Poppins is cheerful, strong, good-hearted and devoted to her friends but she remains an engima throughout the film and we never really get to know her well. Where does she come from? What is she? Where does she get her magical powers? However, we get to know Maria through and through. She's not a hero or a villian. She has her strengths (cheerful, good-hearted, pious) and weaknesses (outspokeness, flighty disposition.) just like the rest of us. She feels a little more 'real' to me than Mary. No offense to Mary though since Mary Poppins is supposed to be a fairy tale--and not 'real.' Julie Andrews winning an oscar for Mary Poppins isn't exactly a BAD choice, just not what I would have chosen for her.Andrews is paired by Dick van Dyke as Bert, a lower class jack-of-all-trades. He wins the audience over with his usual comedic style (grimaces, jerky movements, etc.) I admit I got a bit tired of him toward the end. His particular brand of Quixotic charm (dancing with penguins and the laughter sequence) wore off on me after an hour. Glynis Johns gives a wonderful performance as the flighty, eccentric, suffragette mother (the jokes poking fun at feminism during her first scene are a riot) and manages to be funny without getting annoying. John Tomlinson is also great as the gruff, cantankerous, no-nonsense father and his 180 degree personality turn at the climax is one of the film's finest moments.There is one more performance worth mentioning that is rather un-sung but one of the best in my opinion: Hermione Baddeley as Ellen, the middle-aged brunette maid. I love the funny faces she makes in the first few scenes:1. When Mrs. Banks checks the clock for the umpeenth time. ""Ah! It's almost eight o'clock! Posts everyone! Posts!"" She and the two maids position themselves around the ceramics and glass so when the canon shakes the house nothing will get broken. The grand piano slams into Ellen. Mr. Banks says ""Ellen, are you allright?"" Ellen pushes the piano back, rubs her back in pain and says ""Yes. I'm allright."" The crossed eyes and grimace on her face when she delivers this line is PRICELESS.2. When she goes to the door to tell all the other governesses that the post has been filled. They are all gone so she gives her message to the dog.3. Her astonishment at Mary and the children sliding down the staircase.No one really struck me as award worthy but you can still hit a home run without without making a grand slam.The visual effects won a richly deserved oscar. Even by today's standards they are very impressive.1. When Mary and Jane snap their fingers and the toys get picked up.2. The smoke staircase.3. When Mary, Bert, Jane and Michael jump into the chalk picture on the ground. They become smaller and smaller and disappear in a cloud of chalk dust.4. And of course the combination of real-life people and animated figures.Chim-chimer-ree won Best Song that year. There's not a single song in Mary Poppins I didn't like but for my money ""Feed the Birds"" was the best. It is the heart and soul of the movie. It is the beginning theme and is repeated in the quieter, more moving parts like when Mary puts the children to bed and Mr. Banks walks to the bank knowing he's going to get fired for starting a run but ready to take on full responsibility for it.Two other things I really admired were:1. How they develop the platonic relationship between Bert and Mary. Does Hollywood still know how to make a movie where a man and a woman are only good friends?2. How they flesh out the strengths and weaknesses of the parents. Mr. Banks is grumpy, mean and cantankerous. He seems to be annoyed at everything and everybody--particualry the children. Mrs. Banks is kind and gentle to the children but she has a tendency to neglect them--pursuing her own activities. However, Mr. Banks does go to work to make money for the family and Mrs. Banks bends over backwards to make sure her daugher (and future grandaughters) will be able to have a say in political matters when they grow up. Neither of them would win the Best Parent of the Year Award but they weren't terrible either.Five Stars?

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3SR2FSNU40ZSD	"L. Boki ""L. Boki"""	"I didn't know when I fell in love with ""Mary Poppins"" that a major part of my attraction to her was her willingness to fill her work children with all types of altering goodies. In that basket, Miss Poppins was a renaissance drug pusher....eager to get her little ones back in a controllable state.""Supercalifragilistic...."" is the ultimate stoned out psychobabble diddy.Though she wasn't necessarily a seductress, I was pretty sure that if she wanted to duet on ""Chim Chim Shiree"" that her master would soon fall under her spell.You see miss Mary wasn't this good ole girl. The woman was a little lazy because she was far too anxious for her work family to handle their own chores.So now that a half century has gone by, like ""The Wizard of Oz"", which was also a psychedelic trip, ""Mary Poppins"" is like working girls in ""The Wiz"".1964 was such a magical year. After the devastating tragedy of the previous November '63, we welcome The Beatles to America, by the summer, The Supremes proudly ushered in the Motown Sound and began their counterattack to the British Invasion and then by summer's en, ""Mary Poppins"" flew into theaters across the country as we were still asking, ""Where Did Our Love Go"". It was all too enchanting. By the end of 1964, we were singing ""Come See About Me"" and ""She Loves You"" to soldout theaters with ""The T.A.M.I. Show"", the Baby boomer generation's first entry into ""Live AID""(sans the charitable aspect) gargantuan musical event introducing the masses to The Supremes, The Rolling Stones, James Brown and various Motown acts. So holiday movie going was ideal for the 12-24 year old demographic. Mary Poppins joined Paul, John, George, Ringo, Diana Flo and Mary as the most beloved figures of 1964.The recent release of ""Saving Mr. Banks"" helped to refuel interest in Miss Poppins, the original pusher woman peddling her mind altering goodies to her adopted family. ""Supercalifragilisticexpealodocious"" became the ultimate psychobabble theme song."	5.0	The Original Pusherwoman	2014-01-15	1	0	1

While these films do show their age, they have nonetheless held up well over time and we've all viewed them over and over. I had never actually seen Mary Poppins until recently, and found this film to be quite disappointing--as did the grandchild, who was ready to hit the road before the kids even appeared. Everything about this movie is annoying, from the made-for-TV type effects, to the accents, to the very predictable story itself. It's neither fun, nor satisfying, and definitely not engaging for kids. Get the anniversary edition of Wizard of Oz instead--it's a far, far better film!	2.0	The years have not been kind to this one	2009-09-23	27	1	26

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	AD2BIAIH78QI5	"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal"""	"...and if you know the punchline to that one, then you've already seen ""Mary Poppins"", the best live-action movie ever produced by Walt Disney Productions in the master's lifetime. London is brought to the screen beautifully, gray and coal-based but not without parks and trees--but how wonderful everything becomes when we pop off into a sidewalk chalk drawing! Then the English countryside explodes with color and talking/singing livestock, even though penguins aren't quite native to the British Isles.The chalk drawing is courtesy of Bert the erstwhile chimney sweep and it's he also who introduces us to Cherry Lane and its unhappy inhabitants, the Banks family. Unhappy because the two children Michael and Jane are being neglected while the parents pursue a banking job and the suffragette movement. What's needed is a good nanny to take things in hand, and right on cue, down lands Mary Poppins on the doorstep. Michael and Jane are convinced she has magical powers and even magical friends, but Father is convinced otherwise, although he can never best her in conversation. How the Banks family get in touch with each other and the power of familial love is the crux of the matter, and it couldn't happen without the intervention of Mary Poppins.Julie Andrews is a stand-out in her debut role, and never looked lovelier than here in her dark wig with a proper amount of hair--not that close cropped signature hairstyle she's had since ""The Sound of Music"" that does nothing for her. She's a prim know it all with a lovely soprano voice, who slyly indulges in magic from time to time. Dick Van Dyke has a double role as Bert, her roguish beau and as old Mr. Dawes, the greedy head of the bank where Mr. Banks works. David Tomlinson is great as the civil servant dad, the sort of fellow cariacatured by John Cleese so well. Glynnis Johns has less to do as Mother, but still good. And other supporting roles amply filled by Reta Shaw, Hermione Baddeley, Arthur Treacher, Ed Wynn, Elsa Lanchester, and Jane Darwell (in a nonspeaking role as the Bird Woman of St. Paul's, her last role). And not to forget those wonderful child actors playing Michael and Jane! Not a moppet between them.""Mary Poppins"" is a delight from start to finish.

But in reality, the parents are the ones that should watch it because underneath the world of carousel horses coming to life and tea parties on the ceiling and &quot;Chim Chim Cheree&quot; there is a very important lesson: you should never be too busy for your kids. Both parents, not just the father, were too invloved in their own things..whether it be Mr. Banks' postition at the bank or Mrs. Banks' crusade for women's rights. Mary, like the nannies before, was basically hired to do the parents' job. There are plenty of instances where the parents prove that they know nothing about their kids. I won't give away the ending, but the parent viewers would definitely be reminded that their kids grow up too fast and that there's no substitute for the love of a mother and father.	5.0	Parents Today Should Watch This...	2003-08-17	1	1	0

One could say that Mary  Poppins has a magical right-brain personality. Delightful adventure, catchy  songs, terrific dancing, colorful scenes. Add Dick Van Dyke, David  Tomslinson, Glynis Johns, Hermione Baddley, Reta Shaw, Arthur Treacher, and  Reginald Owen who are just some of the many wonderful performers in this  dynamic, early-Disney musical.	5.0	BET YOU HUM the SONGS after VIEWING!	2000-08-20	2	2	0
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK	"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing"""	"I probably give too many movies five stars.  However, this movie truly deserves five stars, and probably six.  While this movie was an achievement for Disney, it would have been an achievement for any studio, winning five Oscars, another twelve awards, and another twelve nominations, which included a best actress award for Julie Andrews in her first movie appearance.What makes ""Mary Poppins"" so magical?  Certainly the production values are incredible.  Though everything was filmed on a set, the production in this two hour nineteen minute movie is crisp and tight, with every moment focused on moving the plot forward.  But the magic in this movie is the focus on the children, and the children's view of our world; they see the world as a place of magic and wonder, and we see objects and obligations.  Whose world would you rather live in?When children are the age of Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber), they are trying to understand the world, which can seem so confusing.  Unfortunately, their father, George W. Banks (David Tomlinson, a Disney regular who also appeared ""The Love Bug"" and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks""), is a banker who has forgotten what it is like to be a child.  Worse, he barely acknowledges his children at all.  The children's mother, Winifred Banks (Glynis Johns, who has made more than 90 movie and television appearances), is barely better as she focuses on the needs of society rather than those of her family.  So who is to explain to the children what is expected of them as they grow older?Mary Poppins magically arrives and provides the bridge between the world of adults and the world of children.  Wonderfully aided by Bert, played by Dick Van Dyke, Mary Poppins shows the children first and foremost that she understands them.  Then Mary Poppins shows Mr. and Mrs. Banks that they have forgotten how to have fun, and that they could learn much by trying to understand their children.  Lastly, Mary Poppins shows the children that their parents really are looking out for them, if they could only understand their parents.To make all this magic work, Disney combined animation and outstanding special effects.  Indeed, this movie won the 1965 Oscar for best visual effects.  Mary, Bert and the children gambol about an animated countryside, in a style that was used again in ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks.""  There is a marvelous scene with Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) where we see Uncle Albert is laughing so much that has floated from the earth.  Then there is the wonderful scene with chimney sweeps singing and dancing on the rooftops of London.This 40th anniversary edition has a second DVD that includes an incredible number of extras.  If you are not a fan of extras, these will mean little to you.  If you like extras, these are excellent, including a fifty minute documentary that helps explain how some of the scenes were filmed.""Mary Poppins"" is not only practically perfect in every way; it is a rare movie adults and children can enjoy without provisos of any sort.  Furthermore, it is an opportunity to remind adults of a time when they too could see our world as a magical, barely understood place, and to remember that our own children still see the world that way.  Watch this one again and remember your own childhood, and relive that childhood through your own children, or perhaps grandchildren.  Enjoy!"	5.0	Magical Disney Great	2006-05-07	5	4	1

I must say I spend two whole days reviewing the special features. It is amazing and a must have DVD for the Holidays and all year long.This DVD edition is remastered in the DISNEYS' THX home Theatre set up. The audio is incredible and the restored print is amazing bright, vibrant and textured. The movies are toted as Walt's best achievement ever. And it has everything you would want in a film for the entire family including a break down of sing-a-long songs.40th Anniversary DVD contains:A special audio commentary track with the none other than Academy Award Winning JULIE ANDREWS (The Sound of Music, The Princess Diaries, 10) and DICK VAN DYKE (Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Bye Bye Birdie, The Dick Van Dyke Show) themselves. Reminiscing about the music, production and even Mr. Walt Disney himself. Also on the track is Karen Dotrice (Many Lives of Thomasina) who plays young Jane Banks and composer Robert Sherman (All the Disney Classics). They all seem to speak fondly of the shoot, the cast and crew and especially have some funny memories of the production itself.A MAGICAL REUNINION: There is a great walk down ""memory lane"" with Robert Sherman, Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews. They musically review through stories and example of the songs and how the evolution occurred. Dick van Dyke is amazing enthusiastically about his part as Bert. Julie discusses everything from the children to learning about making her very first film ever.THE MAKING OF MARRY POPPINS: Is an amazing visual and educational look at the making of the film. This is the longest of the extra features and goes in depth of the time, energies and efforts into making this Walt Disney classic. Filled with outtakes, behind the scenes footage and commentary from Julie and most of the cast, crew and musical influences of the film. It is hosted by - Dick Van Dyke (Bert) himself!Other features include Dick Van Dyke's original MAKE-UP test, THE GALA WORLD Premiere at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood and one of my favorites the DECONSTRUCTION of two scene that include the break down of special effects and animation and their elements being combined.I LOVE TO LAUGH - A game for the kids who have watched the movie and handle some visual trivia from the film.THE CAT THAT LOOKED AT THE KING: Finally there is an extra bonus of a great little new animated short that is from one of the original P.L. Travers books. Julie Andrews herself takes you through the adventure in a very ""Marry Poppins"" sort of way. Guest voices include David Ogden Stiers (Beauty and the Beast, M.A.S.H., Pocahontas), Tracey Ullman (The Tracy Ullman Show, I Love You To Death, Once Upon A Mattress) and England's own Sarah Ferguson.The film directed by Robert Stevenson  (Bedknobs and Broomsticks, The Love Bug, The Absent Minded Professor)  is an amazing piece of fun, entertainment and a true lesson in life and the love of family. Richard and Robert Sherman's score, music and songs will leave you singing long after the movie is over! This is an Amazing DVD with tons of extras for the family to enjoy. Sentimental moments, very funny moments and some very heartwarming emotions get this one before it disappears like Marry Poppins herself does! I loved it!

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	AZTDHDUTVOSCC	"mallard ""calvin"""	"Search no more for the perfect gift for the kids. The position has been filled by ""Mary Poppins.""The 1964 musical about the ""practically perfect"" nanny sails into stores this week in a refined and polished two-disc anniversary-edition DVD.Poppins brings a much-needed sense of joy to the strict Banks household in 1910 London. She's the answer to her two young charges' prayers.""In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun,"" she tells them. ""You find the fun and - snap - the job's a game.""Poppins' panache and a magic carpetbag of tricks made the film a huge hit, rescuing the financially struggling Disney studio. It was Broadway star Julie Andrews' first film, the third for co-star Dick Van Dyke and the last for Arthur Treacher (Constable Jones).It won five Oscars, the most for any Disney film, including best actress for Andrews and best song, ""Chim Chim Cher-ee,"" by composer brothers Richard and Robert Sherman. But Oscar easily could have picked ""A Spoonful of Sugar,"" ""Let's Go Fly a Kite"" or Disney's favorite, ""Feed the Birds.""The supercalifragilisticexpialidocious DVD set includes lots of new bonus material, including a cartoon starring Andrews, a game and a deleted song, ""Chimpanzoo."" Andrews and Van Dyke provide audio commentary and appear in a musical reunion.The best extra is a 50-minute featurette that describes Walt Disney's 20-year struggle to make the film. Also, Van Dyke laughs about his fake cockney accent. ""It's amazing how the British forgave me,"" he says. Glynis Johns tells how Disney had to sweet-talk her to play Mrs. Banks. ""When I think of how nearly I didn't do it, it's amazing, because I'm so proud to be a part of it,"" she says"	5.0	After 40 years, it's still a jolly holiday with Mary Poppins	2004-12-17	4	4	0

But even if it weren't... even if I never had children of my own and never enjoyed it with them... how could I, how could anyone, not love Mary Poppins?This is the very best movie that Disney Studios ever produced. The music is infectious. The mixture of live action and animation is groundbreaking. It is cheery -- OK, maybe too cheery -- and heartwarming. Julie Andrews was never better, and I include the Sound of Music. And Dick Van Dyke, despite his ridiculous accent, is immensely likable. (OK, not everything is cheery. If you don't get a little teary-eyed at Feed the Birds, you're not human.)If you have any affection at all for Disney movies, you have to love Mary Poppins.	5.0	Seriously - it's Mary Poppins!	2014-01-07	1	1	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1LQPMX21BS6N8	Marilyn Monroe	Hello all! A great classic starring Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins, English nanny and helpful chimney sweeper extrodinaire-by the way, despite what the dictionary says, supercalifragilistic-expealidotious, means to expidite, to go fast. Anyway this is a timeless classic, and it was aired on Disney's ABC-Sunday night for the first time in probably twenty years, shown on television that is! A spoonful of sugar is probably about cough syrup, but back then I believe it was either castor oil or cod liver oil!YUCHHHH! This movie must be seen to be beleived and if you have the time, watch as Mary Poppins floats down on the town in a dirty black smock and a black umbrella, and gets herself a job as a clean the kids room type nanny!

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	"The Banks family is in need of a new nanny for Jane and Michael.  Fortunately, one arrives on the wind in the form of Mary Poppins.  She's everything the kids want, fun and magical.  But while she's taking them to chalk painting countrysides and tea parties on the ceiling, their father is less then happy.  Can he be made to see beyond the end of his nose?Ok, so this movie is really little more then an excuse for song and dance numbers.  It's still great!  The plot is paper thin, and you loose site of it in the middle of some of their fantastic scenes.  Of course, part of that is because the movie is based on a book that is really nothing but short stories.  Still this movie is more about fun then anything else.  And it has that in spades.  What kid wouldn't have fun imaging that they get to do all the things that Jane and Michael do in this movie?It's said that Walt Disney poured everything he had learned into making this film, and it shows.  Many of the special effects hold up remarkably well today.  There were some I still hadn't figured out until watching this special edition.  And the music!  Any fan of Disney knows these songs by heart.  And you can't help but find yourself humming ""A Spoonful of Sugar,"" ""Jolly Holiday,"" ""Let's Go Fly a Kite,"" or ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"" for days after seeing it.Those wanting to own a great DVD of this film won't be disappointed in this two-disc set.  Disc one features the movie in all its wide screen glory.  I can't see how it's ever looked better.  The soundtrack has many different options, but the Home Theater mix will blow you away.  It's fantastic.  There is also a commentary track featuring Julie Andrews, Dick van Dyke, Karen Dubice (Jane), and Richard Sherman.  Sprinkled in are archive comments from others, including Disney himself.  Also included are some pop up facts to read along with while watching the movie.  Disc two features a new documentary on the film, a deleted song, and more on the music with Julie, Dick, and the composers.  And be sure to check out the animated ""The Cat That Looked at a King,"" a tale adapted from one of the later books in the series.One thing that comes through loud and clear in this set is how much fun everyone had making it and how much they respect Walt Disney.  The fact that this film has lasted 40 years is testament to his genius.  With this set, it'll be enjoyed by generations to come."	5.0	Perfect in Every Way	2005-02-28	6	6	0
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3E832FY3AIKFT	"Mark Clegg ""Nathan's Dad"""	The film speaks for itself. As fresh and damn well entertaining as it was forty years ago, this is How To Make a Family Movie 101. The cast are uniformly excellent (ignoring Dick Van Dyke's appaulling Cockney accent) and the songs are by far the Sherman Brothers' best. The extended running time never drags and the script sparkles with it's aim at every demographic.The extras are still a little sketchy - the 'plus much more' not boding very well - but the real gem of this is the commentary. Very few classic movies of this vintage are lucky enough to have their two principle performers still alive and I really had hoped that Andrews and Van Dyke would take to the microphone. I am not disappointed! Hopefully this will be an all-new group commentary and not just interveiw snippets spliced together.The other hope for this disc - and this one seems less likely - is that this will be released around the same time as the stage production of the movie hits the London stage. I would love to see some coverage of this show on the extras ala Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, but since the show will be in it's infancy, I doubt whether there would be time to assemble such footage. We may have to wait for the fiftieth anniversary edition for that!	5.0	Poppin' Full of Extras!	2004-10-15	7	6	1

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1URXSRV6WDHVY	Marty Gillis	"'Mary Poppins' from Disney Studios in 1964 was a groundbreaking film in many ways. Not only did it successful blend both live action and animation in new and exciting ways, it also featured a top notch stellar cast of old pros and extremely talented newcomers (many of whom we would soon be seeing LOTS more of) and the beautiful original music by the Sherman Brothers, the greatest songwriters that ever worked for Disney. With the songs sung by one of most beautiful voices of all time, the great Julie Andrews, Mary Poppins is entertainment at it's best.While created primarily as a 'Family Film' there is something about 'Mary Poppins' that resonates with ALL age groups and speaks to me differently now at age 59 than when I first saw it in 1964 at the Northgate Cinema in Seattle.  It is fun for the entire family and has plenty of Re-Watch-ability built right in.With that said, this review will be focusing on the video and audio portions of the Blu ray presentation, and not the film itself.'Mary Poppins"" looks REALLY GOOD on Blu Ray. It is not perfect and simply can not be due to the sheer amount of old school optical effects that are achieved at the expense of both clarity and perceived picture resolution.  I honestly did not except too much from this transfer and was happily surprised throughout the presentation.I really must say that the work that went into this transfer must have been enormous.  Almost all the dirt and debris has been cleared way along with print damage like scratches, etc.  Color timing looks very good, perhaps the color saturation level is just a bit on the light side of things, but overall it is very natural looking.  Contrast and Brightness levels are very good and the film looks spectacular in motion.  Nice and smooth.....The problem areas of this transfer all revolve around the special effects of the time which were mostly achieved optically, by printing multiple layers of negative onto a composite piece of film. By the time all the elements are inserted and printed, you might be looking at 4 or 5 generations and you have lost clarity with each one.I was frankly shocked by how well Disney has handled this title. I was not expecting things to turn out as well as they did. However......... You can pretty much guess each time the film will dissolve (fade) into another scene as you are then at at least 2 layers and things will be noticeably ""blurrier"". Also, during much of the animation scenes with the human actors, you will notice the rotoscoping around the live actors and at times it is sloppy looking. This is NOT from the current Blu Ray transfer, but from the original effects process.  Honestly, the film has been polished and cleaned up to the point where it only really slips badly visually a few times. For me, the worst looking segment was during the room cleaning sequence. Not ALL of it, just parts.  If you have a critical eye, you will notice the weak spots immediately but soon realize they are perfectly acceptable within the framework of the full movie. MOST of it is great so there is enough wiggle room for those rather weaker looking moments.No overuse of edge enhancement/sharpening or DNR can be seen. Technically this is a top notch transfer. Decent bit rate and no visible encoding artifacts that I could spot. Hats off to the team that accomplished this!Still, I am truly only mentioning all this for those who buy the disc and then are bitterly disappointed that 'Mary Poppins"" doesn't look ""Perfect"" on Blu Ray. The simple reason is IT CAN'T look perfect since it never WAS perfect.  But Marty G is saying right now that this is the VERY BEST he has ever seen 'Mary Poppins"" look on home video.ON a scale of 1 to 5, I would say the Video quality 'Mary Poppins"" is an average of 3.3/4 and at time hits 4.5 while at other times sinks down to perhaps 3.0. The visuals aren't all that consistent at times, but only someone who is really looking for it will notice it much.OK, so the picture is pretty darn good, how about the sound?The audio on 'Mary Poppins"" is where this disc REALLY shines. The musical numbers especially just come to life in DTS HD-Master Audio 7.1 Surround.  I was disappointed that the original Stereo mix is only presented in Dolby Digital but the re-purposed surround mix is quite good and I went with it.  Decent surround activity and even some sub involvement, this is a lively mix that belies the age of the source elements. Nice job!The original production sound lacks a bit in the dialogue department. Oh , you can hear everything, but it at times has a weak and canned sound to it. The techniques and limitations of the day are to blame I am sure.  The music itself is wonderfully reproduced as are all the vocals.  Foley and Ambient effects are nicely mixed to take advantage of the surround format and I found myself quite satisfied with the audio on this Blu ray disc.Special features abound on this disc and the Supplements are quite extensive.  Most are in SD, while a few are at least in wide screen with a 14 minute HD quasi-commercial (basically) for the new 'Saving Mr. Banks' film.  Honestly though, the special feature are so numerous I don't have the time or space to write about all of them. Basically,. They are for the most part quite good and will interest all who love the film to begin with.  Just the movie alone on Blu Ray is well worth the price, but the addition of this plethora of extras puts the icing right on top of the cake.  Yes, you guessed it, they are Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  !!  I had to say that once! (sorry)'Mary Poppins' is a true classic that will entertain and delight for many years to come. This Blu Ray presentation gives you the very best rendering of both the video and audio available.  While not perfect, it is a great film with a very ambitious Blu Ray transfer that SHOULD delight most fans. Looks very good, sounds even better! I had a huge smile on my face all during the screening. It's an amazing achievement!Highly recommended by ME, Marty G!"	5.0	'Mary Poppins' Blu Ray not perfect, but VERY close!	2013-12-08	162	158	4

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2R6RA8FRBS608	Matthew G. Sherwin	"This edition of Mary Poppins will captivate you and entertain you to no end! GRIN Finally, a QUALITY two DVD set of this awesome classic Disney picture! I remember seeing Mary Poppins when I was much younger and this release does not disappoint! It is loaded with extras and the quality of the picture and sound is excellent!The plot of the movie involves Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins, a magical nanny who becomes the governess of the Banks children who have a stuffed shirt father. (By the way, this part is similar to the role Julie would play the following year as Maria in The Sound of Music.) How Mary finds out about the job is in itself magical since the father of the Banks children had thrown away the letter they wrote asking for a nanny! We never get to know where she came from, either! Mary uses her love and natural powers to bring joy to the Banks children without ever being too overbearingly ""preachy."" Later on in the movie the father is faced with the possible loss of his job and the moral of the story is delivered to the audience in a very well done fashion.The acting is superlative and the musical numbers are unforgettable. To this day ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" remains an extremely catchy song and the other songs like ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"" and ""A Spoonful of Sugar"" are completely enchanting!But there's more! This DVD set is loaded--and I mean loaded--with valuable extras that will entertain you and raise your understanding of how the film was made as well as its history. For example, there's ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: The Making of Mary Poppins"" - a new 50-minute documentary, footage of the ""Gala Movie Premiere,"" and a make up test for Dyke Van Dyke. There are songs and games for children (and the children in us), too!After you see this you will understand why the movie got Julie Andrews a Best Actress Oscar (in her film debut, no less) and why Dick Van Dyke is so talented and perfect for his role as Mary's boyfriend. (Look for Van Dyke also in the role of the senior officer of the bank!) All together the film received 13 Oscar nominations including Best Song for ""Chim Chim Cher-ee!"" Although some of the technical effects are not the state of today's art, the film did receive Oscar awards for technical effects and music. Simply put, I highly recommend this two DVD set for Disney fans, Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke fans, and fans of musicals. This edition of Mary Poppins will not disappoint!"	5.0	Lesson One in how to PROPERLY restore a movie!	2004-12-16	6	6	0

Mary Poppins who is to have been the greatest of nannies was rude and insensitive to her employers, was off flying around and flirting with the chimney sweep, ignoring her duties, encouraging lots of &#34;sugar&#34; and disrespect.The Chimmney sweep was in way too many sequences of the film, His dancing once was enough.The riduluous treatment of Mrs Banks who was interested in voting rights for women were diminished by the ignorant, unmotherly treatment by Walt Disney.Many of the songs are good, memorable and the grouchy bankers were done well.I wouldn't waste my time with this film with your children.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3N0HBW8IP8CZQ	"Melissa P. Cooper ""kymissyin"""	"Like many folks here, I saw this one when I was very young--right after second grade, I think. By the time it came to the theater in my little rural hometown a year after its release, Julie Andrews had already won an Oscar for her work as the title character.  Not that that mattered.  To the kids in my class at school, this was the hot, must-see movie of that summer--the way ""Star Wars"" would be in the next decade.  I can still remember laughing over Dick Van Dyke tap-dancing with the penguins and crying during the ""Bird Woman"" song (which was as much social commentary as a sentimental tune about our feathered friends). I became a fan of Dick Van Dyke's show after this--he basically won my heart as Bert--the jack-of-all-trades special friend to Mary and the Banks' children.  For the rest of that summer, man, I WAS Mary Poppins.  My mom bought me a record of all the songs, I used her old Avon sample case as my carpetbag, and I acted out the movie every day. If VCRs and DVDs had been everyday household items then, I would have asked for ""Mary Poppins"" for Christmas. (It would have been worn out by Easter, most likely!)As happens to children almost overnight, my interests changed over the next year and I sort of got over my fixation with Mary, Bert, et. al.  After all, Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke went on to other things after that, so why not me?And then in the 90s, Disney re-released ""Mary Poppins"" as a video.  I bought it for my daughter (or at least that was the excuse I gave my husband).  Though she was too young to understand everything in the movie--just as I was the first time I saw it--she, too, loved ""Mary Poppity"" as she called it.  We must have played it at least 3 times a week during the first summer we had it, while living in temporary housing and waiting for our house to be built.  She, too, loves to act this one out and to sing the songs for hours on end.  The apple does not fall far from the tree, I guess.As for me. . .it's all I remembered it to be, and then some. For starters, the music. . .what was missing from the old record I had were the overture, underscores, and closing score--they were beautifully put together.  And the little details are delightful, too.  Among them:  Mrs. Banks, who is a feminist (at least when Mr. Banks isn't around) wears bloomers--and later in the movie, we discover Mary Poppins does, too.  (don't blink, or you'll miss seeing them)  The relationship between Mary and Bert. . .as a child I thought they were probably a couple but never had time to see each other because of their work.  Now?  I think they would be a couple if they got a lucky break.  Let's face it--she's a nanny and he's a lower-level tradesman.  Even if they did get married,  in 1910, the realities of British society were such that if you weren't part of the gentry, you worked for a living, and changing your ""class"" or status didn't happen.  A shame, because their characters obviously love children very much.  So they do the next best thing--work together as a team to bring happiness to British middle-class homes--mainly by shaking up the parents.  Mary was no ordinary nanny, but Bert made her an even better one--he was the idea man, and she handled the implementation.And therein is the secret:  this movie was not as much about Mary, Bert, and the kids as it is about Mary, Bert, and Mr. and Mrs. Banks.  It's when Mr. Banks realizes that his children don't need a nanny to be happy--they just need their parents to love them and give them their attention--that he also becomes the man that the Bank needs.  The scene between Bert and Mr. Banks at the house is one of the best in the movie.As for the ending?  When I was a child, I didn't understand it.  Now, as an adult, I do.  The mission was accomplished, and it was time to move on.  As one of the main characters said, all was as it should be.So is this movie.  Enjoy it with your own daughter. . ."	5.0	I loved it as a child.  I love it more as an adult	2002-04-16	33	28	5

I haven't seen it in years but it's just as great as when I first saw it in the movies as a ten year old.  Every child should be made to watch this movie.  It's about more than children needing a nanny.  It's about the family as a whole.  The kids don't need a nanny to be happy.  They just need their mom and dad.  This is one of the all time Disney great movies.  It's a great family picture.  No car chases, bombs, sex, cursing, nudity, rap music, miniskirts, etc.This dvd is well worth having.  There are so many extras that they are longer than the movie.  I've been up for hours trying to see everything but I gave up.  I'll have to see the rest of it tomorrow.  Interviews, the premier, out takes, behind the scenes, after party, red carpet, star interviews after the movies, deleted songs, plus much, much, more.Mary Poppins looks great on dvd.  The images are sharp and clear.  Please don't miss this one.  Make sure you see it with your children.  Pass it down to the next generation.	5.0	Fantabulous!	2004-12-22	5	4	1
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"In 1964, Walt Disney Pictures, under the directorship of Robert Stevenson, released what became a timeless, musical, fantasy called ""Mary Poppins"".  Starring Julie Andrews as the mysterious & magical Mary Poppins, the film is a fictional account of a dysfunctional family living in London circa 1910.  The father, George W. Banks (David Tomlinson, who played Emelius Browne in ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" in 1971), is obsessed with his job at a prestigious Fidelity Fiduciary Bank and with maintaining a professional atmosphere at all times at home.  The mother, Winifred Banks (Glynis Johns, whose film career began in 1938), is preoccupied with demonstrating as a suffragette and maintaining a clean home.  Their young children, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber, who died at the young age of 21 in 1977), are allowed minimal time with their parents, who prefer to have a nanny look after and raise their children for them.  Unfortunately, Jane and Michael rarely like any of their nannies, who regularly quit after the children do something mischievous to each of them.  Also working for Mr. & Mrs. Banks are the maid Ellen (Hermione Baddeley, who played Mrs. Cratchit in the 1951 classic ""Scrooge"") and the cook Mrs. Brill (Reta Shaw, who played in ""Pollyanna"" in 1960 and ""The Ghost & Mr. Chicken"" in 1966), neither of which have the time or the desire to look after Jane and Michael.Following the departure of yet another nanny, George decides to hire an appropriate nanny himself.  Jane and Michael write their own advertisement for a nanny, but George regards their innocent description as rubbish as he intends to find a nanny that will uphold his every professional expectation.  Mysteriously, the children's advertisement, that George tossed out, comes to Mary Poppins.  When a very lengthy line of perspective nannies are seen at the Banks' front door early one morning, all of them are blown away by a strong wind.  Coming down from the sky via an umbrella is the magical Mary Poppins.  Expecting a rush of perspective nannies to race through the door, only Mary Poppins waits to enter the Banks' home.  George interviews Mary, but he is quickly confused by her wit and unexpectedly hires her.  From that point on, nothing is quite the same in the Banks home and the children get a nanny that not only fulfills their expectations, but becomes something much more to them.  Along the way, the children are also introduced to several interesting people, including the handyman Bert (Dick Van Dyke, who starred in his own 1961 TV show and starred in ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang""), Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn, who also played the toy-maker in ""Babes in Toyland"" in 1961) and the bird woman (Jane Darwell).Many of the songs in the film are well known by people who have never seen the film, including:* ""Sister Suffragette"" (4.5/5, Glynis John).  Winifred calling for the rights of women to be able to vote.* ""The Life I Lead"" (5/5, David Tomlinson).  George describing his life and what a British home should be.* ""The Perfect Nanny"" (4.5/5, Karen Dotrice & Matthew Garber).  Jane & Michael telling what they want in a nanny to their parents.* ""A Spoonful of Sugar"" (5/5, Julie Andrews).  Mary encouraging the children to clean their rooms upon her arrival.* ""Pavement Artist (Chim-Chim-Cheree)"" (5/5, Dick Van Dyke).  Bert's carefree life.* ""Jolly Holiday"" (4.5/5, Dick Van Dyke).  Bert describing how wonderful it is to be with Mary Poppins again within the sidewalk chalk painting.* ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" (5+/5, Julie Andrews & Dick Van Dyke).  A word you use when you don't know what else to say.* ""Stay Awake"" (5/5, Julie Andrews). A lullaby to Jane and Michael.* ""I Love To Laugh"" (4.5/5, Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Ed Wynn). Uncle Albert is visited who is suffering from incurable laughter.* ""A British Bank (The Life I Lead"") (5/5, David Tomlinson & Julie Andrews). Mary telling George that he'll be taking the children to the bank with him.* ""Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)"" (5/5, Julie Andrews). Mary describing the life of a poor woman who enjoys feeding birds.* ""Fidelity Fiduciary Bank"" (5/5, Dick Van Dyke and David Tomlinson) Mr. Dawes Sr. (also played by Dick Van Dyke), the CEO of George's bank, sings praises to the British banking system with George to Jane and Michael.* ""Chim-Chim-Cheree"" (5/5, Dick Van Dyke).  Bert describing the carefree life of chimney sweep.* ""Step in Time"" (4/5, Dick Van Dyke). Song and dance upon the sooty rooftops of London.* ""A Man Has Dreams"" (4.5/5 Dick Van Dyke and David Tomlinson) George singing his woes to Bert.* ""Let's Go Fly a Kite"" (4.5/5, David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns). George & Winifred spending time with Jane and Michael.It is not surprising that so many children and adults alike love ""Mary Poppins"".  It's catchy songs and fantastic situations propel the audience into a magical world of laughter and love that can be watched many times while never becoming tiresome.  It also made Julie Andrews a household name with her unforgettable performance as Mary Poppins.  Julie Andrews went on to play leading roles in ""The Americanization of Emily"" (1964), ""The Sound of Music"" (1965), ""10"" (1979) and ""Victor/Victoria"" (1982).I highly recommend the purchase of ""Mary Poppins"" on DVD, where it can be fully appreciated in its widescreen format.  I rate this DVD with 5 out of 5 stars."	5.0	One Word Sums It Up: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!	2003-02-13	64	60	4

And yes, I still think that is the case for Disney.  And I wonder who all those little girls will grow up to marry, when all the boys are fools, tools, slobs, or villains.But Julie Andrews.  JULIE ANDREWS!  Mary Poppins!So I cracked.  And I bought it.And I had a few twinges on my view-through -- the put-down of men as ""rather stupid"" in Mrs. Bank's first number; and the presumption that Mr. Banks' flying a kite with his children was somehow MORE valuable than his daily providing for them (I do appreciate the value of kite-flying, just not the value judgment); and the idea that the kids will respect a nanny who is sweet and pretty, but not one who smells weird.But I went ahead and showed it to the kids, and I'm so glad, because we have been singing the songs like crazy and laughing a lot.  The absolute fantasy of it is marvelous, and the songs are beautiful.  I like how Bert treats Mary.  I like how straight Mary is, as though she isn't magical, when she clearly is.Very nice.Now I'm wondering about Bedknobs and Broomsticks.  Would anyone be so kind as to enlighten me about whether that one is as good?  Thanks!"	4.0	I finally did it	2008-10-12	4	0	4

It works on at least two levels and that's more than you can say for some of the tripe being released recently.At the finale when Mary's duty is completed and it is time for her to move on to another family, I shed a tear for good old Mary and particularly for Julie Andrew's performance as Mary: you can have your current pop icons, I'll take Mary Poppins... no spoonful of sugar needed."	5.0	Welcome Back Mary !!!!!!!!!!!	2005-01-03	4	3	1

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3UK21NY0SBOZ7	Miguel Lescano Cornejo	"During the 90's Disney flicks were lame, drippy musicals. This is not the case with Mary Poppins. The songs are still fresh and vibrant. As a whole this is the most re-watchable musical flick ever, so I'm happy to have it in DVD. Highly recommended to adults, even those that were put off Disney by ""The Little Mermaid"" and the rest of the Eisner era dreck-to-theater.However, I have to admit that from a technical point of view, Mary Poppins shows its age. The blend between humans and cartoons is not that good, so you have to try harder to keep your disbelief suspended.Anyway, it has great nostalgic value for me. Perhaps kids might like it, too...

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3IB1W0SVED0Z3	"Mike Powers ""mkp51"""	&quot;Mary Poppins.&quot;  Many film critics call it the best Walt Disney movie ever made... the crowning achievement from a studio that has brought us such timeless classics as &quot;Fantasia,&quot; &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,&quot; &quot;Bambi,&quot; &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; and &quot;The Lion King.&quot;  For my money, Mary Poppins tops `em all! This fabulous musical comedy, starring Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson, and Glynis Johns, and based on the best selling British children's books written by P.L. Travers, ranks as one of the two best children's movies ever made. (The other being &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot;)Where to begin? This is such an extraordinary movie!! It has everything that a great kid's movie should have: a wonderful story that teaches strong family values; a brilliant cast; absolutely stunning special effects (even by today's standards); and wonderful music. Here are just a few of the things I like best about &quot;Mary Poppins:&quot;THE ACTING is absolutely brilliant! Julie Andrews won a Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of Mary Poppins. She imbues her character with the reserve so prevalent in British society during the Victorian and Edwardian eras. At the same time, she manages to convey a wonderful sense of joy, kindness, and compassion toward the children. Dick Van Dyke is superb as the carefree chimney sweep ans jack-of-all-trades, Bert. His relaxed comic style is perfectly matched to his character. And, while his Cockney accent doesn't quite deliver the goods accurately, it's nevertheless pretty good. (By the way, look for Mr. Van Dyke in a secondary role in this film. I won't tell you which one... but it's unlikely you'll miss him!) David Tomlinson is the third stand-out member of this fabulous ensemble cast. He's practically perfect as the pompous, stuffy martinet of a father, George Banks. Other cast members are excellent as well, especially Glynis Johns as Winifred Banks; and Ed Wynn in his hilarious role as the laughing man, Uncle Albert.THE WRITING: Screen writers Bill Walsh and Don Da Gradi adapted &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; from the series of British children's books authored by P.L. Travers (1899-1996) This is a tender story that addresses many family issues that were as problematic at the beginning of the twentieth century as they are today: responsibility, accountability, and the proper role of parents in the rearing of their children. In the Banks household, we find a family with many of the same problems that afflict today's families: two parents, each focused on their own interests, each so busy with their own lives that they have precious little time to forge and maintain loving bonds with their children. What are the possible consequences for the children? How can these problems be addressed and solved? The beauty of this story is that it's done in a way that's easy for kids, even younger ones (I'd say ages six and older) to understand and learn from.THE MUSIC: All of the music and lyrics in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; are original... composed by Richard Sherman and his brother Robert. This film has some of the best songs ever to appear in a movie! Each song is in itself a classic: &quot;A Spoonful of Sugar;&quot; &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious;&quot; (I think that's how it's spelled!); &quot;Feed the Birds&quot; (my personal favorite); Academy Award-winning &quot;Chim Chim Cher-ee;&quot; &quot;Step in Time;&quot; and &quot;Let's Go Fly a Kite&quot; are but a few of the magical, sometimes whimsical, but always &quot;practically perfect&quot; songs that make this film such a wonderful musical experience.And then there's THE MAGIC... the special effects! In its day, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; was on the &quot;cutting edge&quot; of movie-making technology. Examples of these (what were then) ultra-modern special effects: this was one of the first films to use miniature robotics for animation. (That robin that lands on the window sill during &quot;A Spoonful of Sugar&quot; is a miniature robotic bird!) And, of course, this is also one of the first films to combine real-life actors and animation extensively (the entire sequence with Mary, Bert and the children inside the sidewalk chalk picture.) These special effects may seem a bit tame when compared with today's computer-generated graphics, but make no mistake: they're still eye-popping!Go beyond all the glitz and glitter of the film, and you'll find at the heart of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; a simple story about family, with important lessons for all of us - children and adults alike - on how we can make our homes better and happier places to live.By today's standards, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; may seem a little old-fashioned, even dated. But it's still a great kid's movie! With a well written, touching story, superb music, and outstanding special effects, it's at once brilliantly funny, poignant, joyous, carefree, and just plain marvelous entertainment.	5.0	It's a Jolly Holiday With Mary!	2001-10-28	19	16	3

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3QLAOOTFEHCJI	M. Oleson	"I was at an age that was much too cool to ever see this movie before.  Well, that's not true either.  After having children, we did own a VHS copy that is now long gone.  Sure I've seen it with the kids but frankly wasn't paying much attention.  Now as a grizzled old grandfather, I decided to watch it the right way.  Undistracted and in high definition.Mary Poppins, for the uninitiated, is a magical nanny created by P. L. Travers in a series of books.  This film featured Julie Andrews in her big screen debut and I must say, she is drop dead gorgeous in spite of some heavy costuming replicating 1910 London.  She is perfect as Mary Poppins, who cheerful though she seems is a bit more focused on discipline than what is on the surface.  And in quiet moments seems to have feeling of remorse or regret.  Dick Van Dyke plays Bert, a street performer and some-time chimney sweep.  He not only provides a convincing fun-loving character but also shows considerable dancing ability.  This is especially evident in his dancing sequence with the controversial animated penguins.  Mrs. Travers wanted no animation in the film.Bert and Mary Poppins know each other well and cavort about with the children on a regular basis but there is no hint of romance (another Travers stipulation).  Mary Poppins has answered an ad for a nanny that was scripted by Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber), the young children of Mr. and Mrs. Banks (David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns).  Mr. Banks is a bank officer and Mrs. Banks, doesn't do much of anything but attend women's suffragette meetings.  Mr. Banks is of the strict upper crust method of socializing.  He also believes children are to be seen (if they must) and certainly not heard.  He has not been happy with their lackadaisical upbringing and fired the previous nanny (Elsa Lanchester).""Mary Poppins"" is full of bright and sometimes thoughtful music throughout.  Some of the scenes are a bit lengthy as is the whole movie.  The integration of the animation with the live action is very good and revolutionary for the time.  The dance sequence involving the dozen or so chimney sweeps is beautifully choreographed.  To be sure, ""Mary Poppins"" is a film aimed at children and their parents.  And it is a good one."	4.0	3 1/2 stars for an excellent film for children and their families	2013-12-21	4	3	1

Filled with beautiful, memorable songs, and superb performances, Mary Poppins is a gem and a classic. It is enchanting to see how Mary is able to teach a work-a-holic, self-centered, uninvolved father, and a sweet-but-sidetracked mother what their most precious possessions truly are--their children and their family. And Mary does it all so subtly, even magically, that the medicine really does go down with that spoonful of sugar!Along the way, Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) and Bert (Dick Van Dyke) take the children on magical adventures to an English countryside, a tea party on the ceiling, and a chimney sweep's paradise.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2UQIIJ2CD8REE	Monty Moonlight	"Floating in on the East Wind, the mysterious and magical Mary Poppins arrives at the door of the Banks family to take on the position of nanny to the two Banks children, Jane and Michael. Their workaholic father and politically preoccupied mother have no time to waste raising their children, nor do they feel they need to. It's simply another position to hire for as far as they're concerned. But Mary Poppins puts her magical powers to good use by teaching the Banks parents that missing out on their children's childhood is a mistake they'll never be able to take back. Along with her Chimney sweeping friend, Bert, Mary takes the children into a magical, cartoon world within a chalk pavement drawing, where they attend a fair, ride in a horse race, and take part in a fox hunt. Later, they have a tea party on the ceiling at Uncle Albert's and play Step In Time on the London rooftops with a wild band of Chimney Sweeps. But when father tries to teach the children some responsibility by taking them on a field trip to the Bank where he works, his lack of understanding and experience causes things to get out of hand, and Mr. Banks is fired soon after. It's only after a conversation with Bert, the surprisingly wise chimney sweep, that Mr. Banks learns the error of his ways, and how Mary Poppins' only intentions were to help bring the family together. All works out in the end though, and the rest is Disney history!Hailed as Walt's greatest theatrical achievement, one certainly can't argue the point after seeing this film. It's ""practically perfect in every way!"" The Sherman Brothers outdid themselves, as usual, in the songwriting tasks, and the casting is some of Disney's best. The beautiful backdrops are completely amazing, especially after watching the behind the scenes featurette to see how they were accomplished. There simply isn't ANYTHING bad to say about this astounding picture! The extras are quite nice too. You get the behind the scenes featurette I just mentioned, a theatrical trailer, a trivia game, and footage of the Hollywood premiere of the film. Sure, there could have been a lot more extras, but for a Disney DVD this is actually quite a bit. If you don't already have this film on DVD, you should be kicking yourself right now! So go out and get it!"	5.0	Disney's Greatest Theatrical Achievement!	2002-08-09	0	0	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1WOMXP1TMIX7O	MrsMorland	Like many other reviewers I was motivated to re-watch Mary Poppins after enjoying Saving Mr. Banks. I have to agree with P.L. Travers--Dick Van Dyke has no place in this movie. Was he the big star at the moment? I know Julie Andrews had been passed over for My Fair Lady because she wasn't considered a proven movie star--and this was her next big break. DVD has WAAAAAY too much screen time, tedious dance and humor scenes with his annoying Cockney accent. I would edit out those scenes if I were going to watch it again. Mary/Julie's scenes are much better and the children and Banks parents were good. But a movie truer to the book (which I am also reading now for the first time), with a few musical numbers, would have been much better.Liked: The Life I Lead (Mr. Banks), The Perfect Nanny (Jane), Spoonful of Sugar, Supercalifragilistic (OK on it's own)--that's about it, Fly a Kite (OK)Didn't like: any of Dick VD's interminable numbers (One Man Band, Jolly Holiday/Penguins/Carousel), I love to Laugh (arrghhhhh), Chim Chim Cheree, Step in time--God---how many were there???)Really Hated: Feed the Birds. This is a nice enough song on it's own and was used to beautiful effect in Saving Mr. Banks. Used in the original movie it was scary--like a horror flick--hundreds of pigeons crawling over a corpse of a homeless person for a LONG TIME--they really thought that would be charming to children????Caveat on Mr Banks--the flashback scenes trying to explain PLT's damaged psyche went on and on and on. After seeing Mary Poppins I think PLT was right on in her concern.	2.0	Mrs. Travers wants Dick Van Dyke out	2014-05-18	1	1	0
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A10FBJACMOL2MQ	"Mrs. Paula J. Brill ""paula122"""	"Every one has so eloquently reviewed this wonderful movie that I can add nothing but my personal little story of the way I felt when I first saw the movie.I went with my mother and her friend and we sat in the balcony of an old movie theater down town. I was 9.  The theater is kind of spooky and I remember being a little unnerved by it.  The movie started and I was absolutely and utterly in love with Julie Andrews from the moment she appeared on the screen.  I remember even attemptling to speak with a british accent after I saw the film.  My mother said at the time how wonderful Dick Van Dyke was and I remember being so mad at  her for saying that--how dare she say anything against ""my"" Julie. But seeing it again as an adult I have to say she was absolutely right. (dont you hate it when you have to admit your mother was right? ) I have heard people vilify Dick Van Dyke for his accent but we have to remember that everyone else was british.  He is so wonderful in this film that it takes my breath away and at the end when he is chastising Mr. Banks and telling him in a nice way that he hasnt made enough time for his children, it always makes me cry.  He was wonderful, SHE was wonderful.  Wonderful movie."	5.0	Just a funny little Mary Poppins story......................	2010-11-18	2	2	0

There was chemistry between the two stars. The supporting cast of Glynis Johns, David Tomilson as well as character actor, Ed Wynn and Reta Shaw and Hermionne Badley as the servants supported them well. When I was a child, I loved the film and still love it. My favorite scenes happened when Mary, Bert and the children when they went through Bert's chalk drawing to the fair and included the songs, Jolly Holliday and Supercalifragilistic.	5.0	Julie Andrews Star Turn	2013-12-18	4	1	3

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A30BCRSABL9AYI	Music Lover	Rarely does a movie come along that has the mass appeal of Mary Poppins.  Even more rare is a movie that can stand the test of time.  Still more rare is a movie that combines the two.  This is just such a movie.  The acting is great, the story is great and the music is great.I can remember watching this once or twice as a child and finding it good.  Now that I have 2 kids of my own I'm constantly on the look out for a movie that the whole family can watch without worrying about things like language, nudity, violence and other things that I don't think are appropriate for my 3 year old.  Mary Poppins is a wonderful movie to put in on movie night as not only is it entertaining for the kids but it's also very entertaining for the parents which I have to admit is a rarity these days as you can only watch the same movie so many times before getting tired of it.Great acting, great story, great imagination, great music, great movie, great buy.	5.0	One of the best classics of all time	2006-01-18	2	1	1

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	"Forty years old and still practically perfect in every way! Even at 2hr.s, 20 min. ""Mary Poppins"" remains Walt Disney's crowning technical and artistic achievement; an effervescent eclectic blend of animation/live action and special effects that idyllically encompasses P.L Travers' enchanting best seller. Julie Andrews' London stage performance in `Camelot' so impressed Disney that he immediately began talks to secure her talents for his film. By the time shooting began, Andrews was playing Eliza on stage in `My Fair Lady'. That she was casually looked over for the lead in the film version of that play remains a mystery. But Lady's loss was Poppin's gain.Andrews delights in the title role as the too good to be true nanny with just enough playful larceny lurking beneath her properly quaffed locks and bonnet. She arrives to take charge of the Bank's household and whip them into shape; wife Winifred (Glynis John), husband George (David Tomlinson) and their two children, Michael (Matthew Garber) and Jane (Karen Dotrice). Seems Jane and Michael have been giving the previous nannies a hard time. Actually, they're just a pair of lonely kids who desire the love and attention of their stoic dad. A lowly chimney sweep, Bert (Dick Van Dyke) helps provide Mary and the children with one of those supercalafragalisticexpialadocious bits of escapism set to magic; a fantastic frolic in the country complete with carousel ride, fox hunt and horse races. Yikes, tally-ho! There's so much to admire and celebrate in this perennial classic that it's best left to the home viewer to pop this one in for a jolly holiday of a good time!Disney's deluxe, 2-disc DVD is a genuine treat. At long last, anamorphically enhanced for widescreen televisions, the transfer is generally quite smooth and solid for image quality that will surely please. Colors are rich and vibrant. Blacks are solid and deep. Whites are generally clean. Occasionally there is a hint of age related artifacts as well as some minor pixelization that breaks apart some of the background information, but these distractions are kept to a bare minimum. The audio is a brand new, and very engaging, 5.1 mix for the home theatre aficionado. Extras include the all new 50 min. documentary on the making of the film that is quite comprehensive. There's also some self congratulatory audio commentaries and `A Musical Journey' with composer, Richard Sherman. The rest of the extras are typical Disney catering to the tot's fanfare; a trivia game, special effects junket and some music video and short subject stuff. All in all this is a very nicely packed special edition from the Disney stable and one that's been long overdo. So get out your umbrella or go fly a kite; because ""Mary Poppins"" is shear magic for the young and young at heart!"	4.0	STILL 'PRACTICALLY PERFECT IN EVERY WAY'	2004-12-08	5	3	2

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2TLN3VB1IBDNU	Noah Gale	I can not believe the 50th Anniversary Edition on Blu-Ray of Mary Poppins is coming out already this December 2013. I remember when the 40th and 45th Anniversary Edition of Mary Poppins was re-released on Blu-Ray. Wow! Time flies fast! I love the movie and show.!!! I remember I saw the show on Broadway when I was only 8 years old. My parents and brother took me to the show. I love the part when they sing Supercalifragilisticxpialidocius.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1NLFVSZBEUDNF	No Fool	Can't say enough nice about the movie, about the actors, and about those who made the original movie. The themes in this movie really do need to be conveyed again to this generation of young children, especially given all the poor conduct in the financial markets of late.But I am left disappointed by this 45th Anniversary release. I wonder why should I buy this (again) in regular red laser DVD format when children of this age and adults will find a high definition version so much better. Regular DVD players are not even selling in some advanced countries as people move to Blu-Ray. Disney seem to just milk us every several years for a new edition, and this 45th is not really any better than the 40th Anniversary Edition.Maybe Disney is trying to have us pay for an advertisement for their Broadway version of Mary Poppins, but I don't even care to hear the Broadway show mp3's in this set. If Disney is not simply shoving the Broadway show in our face then why not let us have mp3's of the original performers whom we do recall with some affection?You'd think those of us, especially those who have seen this since the 1960's would not be so gullible as to buy the 45th Edition, then have to buy it again if/when Disney's 'bean-counters' decide its time to milk the public yet again with the Blu-Ray version some time in the future.Pardon the cynicism but this is no longer Walt Disney's company - and it has not been since the days of Michael Eisner.Sorry Mary	2.0	Why is Disney milking us for another DVD when there's Blu-Ray?	2009-02-07	14	8	6

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1ZNGCNKCHW11	"Norman Strojny ""retired tech-person"""	"""Mary Poppins"" appeared in movie theaters in 1964.  I remember the movie playing for week after week after week.  I think this was Disney's biggest hit, ever.  I suppose I have seen the movie three or four times since then.  I always enjoy some of the special effects.  The animation scenes were very good when they first appeared, but have aged a little since then.  And, Julie Andrews had a wonderful voice and sang great songs in the film.In short, a magical nanny swoops in to take care of the Banks children and also helps their father to value them and make time for them. Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) treats the children to adventures with Bert (Dick van Dyke), a street performer/chimney sweep and with her Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) who loves to laugh. There are excellent songs and dance numbers.Children still fall in love with this movie.  Adults still like it.  And Julie Andrews' performance still shines."	5.0	Amazing!	2009-02-16	2	2	0

Please, avoid the ""enhanced home theater mix"" at all costs. It is a distasteful remix of the original soundtrack that seems to be a misguided attempt to update the film to have a more ""noisy"" and ""modern"" feel. The excessive bass is especially inappropriate. The original theatrical mix is clear, magical and engrossing, and was actually nominated for an Academy award. The fact that it is not the default option on this disc is an insult to the people who created the original sound mix."	3.0	"Avoid the ""Enhanced Mix"" and choose ""Original Theatrical Mix"""	2005-02-21	25	17	8

I enjoyed it both times, although it did seem a bit strange to hear Julie and Dick singing in French (seemingly).  This was one of those lavish blockbuster musicals where every song and every dance had to be expanded almost to absurdity.  The Sherman brothers came through as never before or since, and the cast was perfect.  I had seen Julie Andrews in Camelot on Broadway in 1961, but she was even better in this film.	5.0	Disney's masterpiece	2013-05-18	0	0	0

Ed Wynn plays the uncle whose waves of giggles carry him soaring up to the ceiling. Set in Victorian England, the pompous father and fatuous mother are transformed by Mary Poppins' special brand of love, compassion, and understanding.This movie was a blend of animation and live action, one which creator Walt Disney considered to be his crowning achievement. And then, of course, there's the music: A Spoonful of Sugar, Feed the Birds, Chim Chim Cheree, etc.This is one to own and watch over and over with kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews, neighbor kids.

She has such a beautiful voice, which is on record for all time.  New aspiring singers should look to this classy singer, Julie Andrews to learn how to sing!And as someone else pointed out--Dick Van Dyke's amazing skills of dancing and acting as Bert and Senior Dawes STILL takes my breath away.  The ""Step-in-Time"" sequence and the dancing with the animated penguins....The magic involved is imaginative for its time. The power of human suggestion with Mary's singing is quite....what's the word? ""supercalisticexpialidociuos"".  Her ability to talk to animals, making animated objects move.

Highlights - the horse race and the dancing cartoon waiter penguins; Chim Chim Chiree and the acrobatic chimney sweeps; Mrs Banks (Glynis Johns) and her 'Votes for Women'; Reginald Owen's Admiral (with a ship on the roof of his house!); the gorgeous 'Feed the Birds'; the special effects in 'A Spoonful of Sugar'; Ed Wynn as the giggling Uncle Albert; and of course the brilliant performances from Julie Andrews as Mary, Dick van Dyke as Bert/Mr Dawes senior, Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber as the children Jane and Michael, Hermoine Baddeley as the maid, and David Tomlinson as Mr Banks.  Absolutely brilliant and definitely makes you remember being a child with a big smile on your face. Those who don't like it possibly came to it too late in life, but I can't fault it.	5.0	The perfect children's movie	2008-10-09	1	1	0

This movie has always been a favorite of mine, and the DVD set does not disappoint, except for one little thing....The default audio is an ""enhanced"" 5.1 home theater mix that is notably different than the older sound mix we have been used to for so long.  The dialogue and sound effects are ""buried"" beneath the musical score, nearly inaudible at times.  It probably sounds great on the proper audio setup, but something is just amiss for those of us watching this film on a regular television set with 2-channel stereo sound.  Fortunately, there are several audio options for the feature on this DVD: 5.1 enhanced (default); 2.0 enhanced (which sounds just as bad); 2.0 original theatrical mix (this is the one I prefer, as it's the one I'm used to); French 5.1; Spanish 5.1.Otherwise, an excellent set packed with features!"	4.0	Only one minor gripe	2013-04-06	0	0	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A5ZUZ49YRDPCV	Rachel Garret	"1964: Julie Andrews was awarded the Oscar for Best Actress in her performance as Mary Poppins. British-born Julie Andrews was an accomplished singer on the American musical stage, as well as a gifted actress who would later appear in such films as The Sound Of Music and Victor/Victoria. She is most known for her work in this film. To many, it is the zenith of her career; certainly it launched her career. The Disney film was based on the British novelist P.L. Traver's books ""Mary Poppins"" and its sequel""Mary Poppins Comes Back"".George Banks (David Tomlinson), is the typical Victorian husband who works at a prestigious bank in downtown London, whose wife Winnifred (Glynis Johns) is an active feminist, whose children, Jane and Michael have successfully rid themselves of various nannies through their mischief. When the magical Mary Poppins comes into their lives, she transforms their lives through magical going ons (becoming part of a painting, having tea in the air) and brings happiness and remedy to the home that badly needs the affectionate attention of the overworked, uptight father.The Oscar for Julie Andrews as best actress was well deserved. Her prudish, sugary image as the ""practically perfect"" nanny could not have been if not for Mary Poppins. The musical, for this is a musical (which unfortunately never became a Broadway musical) contains lots of upbeat and memorable songs, tinged at times with a melancholy sentiment- ""Feed the Birds"" and ""Chim-Chimeney"" the latter which won Best Song, ""A Spoonful of Sugar"" and the hilarious ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"".A family-oriented film, but suited for child-at-heart adults and musical lovers, this film is perfect entertainment for everyone."	5.0	A Musical Masterpiece: Julie Andrews' Best Performance	2003-03-26	1	1	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1YU3JQIT9421C	Richard Brennan	"I was nine years old when Walt Disney produced the first movie I remember being a ""must see"": Mary Poppins.  After seeing it numerous times as a child, I bought the new DVD - thought I might enjoy seeing it again and sharing it with my nieces and nephews.Mary Poppins retains the same magic and wonder that I remember experiencing as a child. She still remains this enigma - who was she really?  Where did she come from?  What was really going on between her and Bert? The movie answers none of these questions - it just lets them float in the air like it's magical heroine. And that's part of its charm.  The film seems to live by Mary's maxim: ""I never explain anything"".Technically - the film holds up as well, even in this age of digital everything.  I was amazed to learn (in the ""Making of"" documentary that's included on the CD) that the film was shot entirely on the Disney soundstages in Burbank.  They never went on location; they never even went outside.  London is ""painted in"" in a series of beautiful matte glass paintings.  (If I remember correctly, even today, it is the largest number of glass background paintings ever used in a film.)Julie Andrews, of course, is ""practically perfect in every way"" as Mary - a much more idiosyncratic character than the governess she famously played in ""Sound of Music"" a year later.  And that clear soprano voice - never showy, always in character - just lifts the film.  Dick Van Dyke is wonderful as Bert - though accents are clearly not his strong suit.  But as a comic, a mime, a singer and a dancer he is charming as the Jack-of-all-trades friend of Mary.The DVD looks great.  It's letterboxed - but it wasn't shot in wide screen format - so you don't loose much on your TV screen.  The colors are snappy and true.  There is a new ""Making of"" feature, produced especially for the DVD hosted by Dick Van Dyke and featuring interviews with Julie, and some of the other technical team that are still around.  There is some great home movie footage of the chimney sweep dancers rehearsing ""Step in Time"" outside in the California heat stripped down to their skivvies.The one thing on the DVD I do NOT appreciated is a long series of promos for other Disney video releases that you can't cancel out of easily and skip to the film. I think it's rather shameless forcing kids to sit through those commercials to see their favorite movie.All in all - a beautiful presentation of a classic film that adults and children can enjoy together."	5.0	Pratically Perfect in Every Way	2001-11-12	17	17	0

Sometimes I catch myself singing ""A Spoonful of Sugar,"" while doing my sidework at the restaurant where I work.  It is a great work song."	5.0	Practically perfect in every way!	2007-02-14	3	3	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2HFHOEX3LA7TZ	R. L. Guck	Mary Poppins is one of the timeless classics, but my family decided we should watch it again before seeing Saving Mr. Banks. That was a good decision and helped make Saving Mr. Banks (an excellent movie, BTW) a little more enjoyable. I was glad Mary Poppins was available on Amazon, but I gave it 4 stars because it was only available in standard definition.

But I know lots of people are, and I'm not about to start tearing it apart because I find it too treacly...much more than a spoonful of sugar in this flick.  BUt, there's no sense reviewing it.  I'm a 40 year old man, my opinion of this film is not terribly important.  Nor can I comment on whether kids will still like it...neither of mine can be coerced into watching it.But the DVD CANNOT BE FAULTED. It's packed full of features that will make any fan of the movie drool.  Looks and sounds great! If you like Mary Poppins, then I highly recommend this DVD.  Some recent Disney DVD releases felt a bit thrown together, and the ""special edition"" label was a stretch.  But this one reminds me of the SNOW WHITE release.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO	Robert Badgley	"This is a review for the new 2-disc Disney 40th Anniversary edition of Mary Poppins.This is one of the best re-releases of this year.The movie is  STILL(and will be for years to come) an aural and visual delight and designed for families and people of all ages.Interweaving a wonderful story with some groundbreaking techniques and special effects Disney took/takes us on a magical ride in a recreated slice of life from 1910.The story,by now familiar to many,involves the arrival to the Banks household of a nanny(Julie Andrews).In short order she manages to shake the prim and proper Banks household to its Edwardian core and teaches them,especially the ""master"" of his realm Mr.Banks(David Tomlinson),that there are more important things in life than strict adherence to schedule,rules and blind duty to ones'job.Bert(Dick Van Dyke),a friend to Mary,assists her whenever and wherever he can.Julie Andrews plays her character with a wonderful reserve befitting the part and she sings beautifully.Whenever Mary gets too stodgy though Bert,played phenomenally by Dick Van Dyke,is always there to ease the atmosphere and put a smile on everyones' face.The entire cast from the children,the servants to the admiral and the policeman all turn in a superb supporting job from beginning to end.The restored print and accompanying sound track have been given the deluxe Disney treatment.Visually I have not seen as good a print of this film since I first saw it during its' premier in Toronto in late 1964.The versions I have seen over the years either on TV or on video just don't come close to this one.My particular benchmark test was the colour and detail of the panoramic view(with special attention to the sky)when they climb the ""smoke stairway"" and gaze out over a late in the day city of London.It is stunningly beautiful and was as I remembered it after all this time.That cinched it for me.Aurally the liner notes tell us that the sound has been remastered into a Dolby 5.1 ""Theatre Mix""(the original 2.0 theatrical mix is also included).Translation:""Fantastic"".The movie never sounded as clean or as good.I couldn't help but to sing and tap my feet to all the numbers.The set is loaded with a surfeit of extras that will satisfy even the most picky of movie buffs from footage of its' opening premiere in L.A. to a making-of special.So grab the popcorn,get yourself seated comfortably on the sofa,turn down the lights and slip into the magical world of Mary Poppins like you've never experienced before.Oh yes a heads up, grab the hankies for the ""Feed the Birds"" scene/number....you'll need it."	5.0	Mary Poppins-Simply Marvellous!!	2004-12-17	4	4	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	AQRODCIYD7PYX	"Robert F. Powers ""show maniac"""	"I saw Mary Poppins when it was first released in 1964 and even after all these years, the movie never fails to enchant and entertain, boasting the academy-award winning debut of Julie Andrews as the practically perfect, nay, perfect Mary and Dick Van Dyke as Bert the jack-of-all-trades is also superb, even though his cockney accent comes and goes at whim.  His last occupation as a chimney sweep leads to ""Chim Chim Cheree"" as a march across the rooftops of London by he and Mary with the children Jane and Michael as tag-alongs seques into a platoon of sweeps singing and dancing ""Step in Time""led by Bert in one of the longest dance sequences in the history of cinema.P.L. Travers the author of the original stories was somewhat dismayed(to say the least) at the Disneyfication of her somewhat somber and dark tales---but the lighter touch is much preferred over the somewhat dreary production. now trodding the boards on Broadway and London.The movie is brimming with many brilliant set-peices including the extended ""Jolly Holiday"" sequence which seamlessly blends cartoon characters with Mary, Bert and the children featuring the nonsense song ""Supercali....etc"".Another standout sequence is ""Feed the Birds"" the prettiest song in the score.Glynnis Johns as the dizzy Mrs Banks, ""Sister Suffragate"" is adorable and David Tomlinson as the appropriately stuffy Mr Banks who has a somewhat pedantic view on how to run a household,wife and children until Bert, not Mary shows him the error of his ways.To be sure Mary Poppins has its flaws.  Sometimes it tends to be precious(the children)and sweet(the children) but not sweet enough to bring cavities but all in all, Mary Poppins is still fresh and bright after 45 years and 45 years from now when most of us reading this will be memories, Mary Poppins will still be here to enchant and entertain.

But there's one thing about this production that makes me want to break the disc over my knee: Disney has encoded this disc so that every time you watch it, YOU ARE FORCED TO SIT THROUGH THE ...PREVIEWS!The DVD standard allows the producer to prevent viewers from activating certain functions at certain times (to make a DVD-based game, for example, play according to the game rules). But, aside from the FBI warning segment, this is the first movie I've encountered that WON""T EVEN LET YOU STOP THE DISC during the previews. You can't press MENU to get to other features, and you can't press STOP. You're stuck, basically, with the temptation to press EJECT. Fortunately, the production engineers at Disney missed one trick; you can at least Fast Forward through the previews. This is a shade better than turning off the TV and waiting it out.C'mon, Disney. This isn't a rental -- I bought your disc! And you make me sit through 5 minutes of previews for things that I either: own, or choose not to own (thank you very much). I understand Disney's desire to ""cross sell"" their new stuff based on their old stuff. And I don't mind watching previews, but -- every time I play the disc? Shame on you!!After you've wasted five minutes, of your life, enjoy the movie. It's a treasure and I wish someone would make another like it.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1WUMTJOASEL5F	"Robert ""Supermandisco"""	"Disney or not, this is simply Julie Andrews at her very best. Everytime I watch it, I keep thinking how much trouble Mr. Disney had to get the rights to film the project, plus his discovery of Julie in Broadway production of Camelot. They were ready to cast her, but were crossing their fingers for the outcome of the ""screentest"". Low and behold she took over the cinema screen with a ""snap"" of a finger.Another comment I might add, is that some might look at the animation sequence as outdated by today's standards, but to follow the story at a closer level, the animation in this movie is about entering a drawn fantasy world via Mary Poppins. The drawing in the story is a pavement picture among many accomplished by an jack of all trades. He even apologizes for any shortcomings his drawings may have to the home audience in mild references. So, with that in mind, it would be out of character (if you will) to have the animation suddenly appear a phenomenal rendering by today's animation standards because in the story it has been drawn by an apologetic part-time artist. And with that, take a better look at that background forest and the architecture of the colorful bridges, they still leave many animators in the country dust!Mary Poppins is, and always will be, Mr. Walt Disney's ""crowning achievement"". . . make no mistakes."	5.0	Julie's best!	2007-02-04	0	0	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3OI05RGQQN33R	Rock Hard	"""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" is 1000 times more enjoyable and a better movie than ""Mary Poppins. "" What an inane movie!.From the very beginning their is no rhyme or reason to this so-called story.  Even ""Alice in Wonderland"" makes more sense than this musical nonsense.A  man with a medium position in a bank has 2 housekeepers and needs a nanny to take care of his 2 children when he has a wife?  If this marriage needs that many servants for 2 children with a housewife present they should never have had children.The man is portrayed as arrogant and effeminate and the wife as a whimsical butterfly caring only about herself and her interests.  In this case, for the cause of the suffragettes.  Instead of being a mother and a teacher to her children she focuses all her attention at gallivanting in the world of men;  hence, the nanny.After watching, with difficulty, this long and drawn out movie I could not understand how Julie Andrews won an Oscar for her role in this movie.  If she deserved an Oscar it should have been for her splendid role in  ""The Sound of Music"" and not for  this whirlwind of stupidity.A nanny for 2 children who are really no trouble at all?  They have mildly untidy rooms and chase their runaway kite and they need an insane sorceress to sing them into other worlds while avoiding reality.  This domineering nanny walks in and tells the man what to do and is probably why she won the Oscar.  This film has a very blatant message and it's about women's rights.  And that it is paramount that the mother be excused from her responsibility in raising her children and that protesting and fighting against men is her true duty.It's Feminism at its worse.  This movie in a nutshell is about Feminism disguised as a ridiculous children's tale.  It has a patriarchal nanny in charge with a weak unmanful father and a willow 'o' wisp for a mother.  This nanny evokes no warmth, tenderness or kindness but is more in line with a tolerant drill sergeant that sings cadence and smiles a lot in order to deceive.I didn't feel any kind of sadness or joy or humor throughout the movie.  It was too  badly written, directed, and casting was questionable.  Dick Van Dyke made the movie a little bearable during his dance routine on the rooftops but that was it.And the moral of the story is: escape reality into worlds of fantasies and let the nanny be in charge and everything will turn out alright in the end just like in the movie when the father gets canned and goes about singing  like a blithering idiot: supercalifragulisticexpialidotious.When you ponder it, the movie teaches a lie.It turns the home upside down.  The father is incapable of manly character and the wife is out in the streets pursuing them and the state, represented by the nanny, has to step in  with insanity to mend the torn garment.In ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" the man needed a wife and the children needed a mother.  He also needed a job.  He was doing the manly thing and she the womanly thing.  It was natural and it flowed.  That is a great movie.Mary Poppins is a tale of travesty and anyone with a quarter of a brain will see through it.  I can understand 1 or 2 year old enjoying it but adults?  And, this was my first time seeing this movie that is so  well spoken of.  As always,  it's better to watch it or read it yourself than to believe what others think or say.  So be my guest and please watch it and then decide.As a kid I remember hearing the music and I enjoyed it but the movie is a totally different  on the mind.If you must, buy the soundtrack and enjoy the tunes but forget acquiring any moral lesson from the sad and henpecking script.  There's no moral lesson--only an immoral lesson depicting parents abandoning their duties while others step in to divert them into false dreamy paths hidden by animations, music and magic.P.S.  Disney has stopped adding digital copies for PC Windows and instead is herding people to iTunes and others I don't use or care for.  Other companies still support Window PCs.  And if you type in the code and don't download the movie, it's still considered downloaded; hence, you end up with no digital copy."	1.0	Moronic movie.	2013-12-17	22	3	19

Even though there are many wonderful Disney films, this particular selection far surpasses most children's and many adult films I have ever seen. Julie Andrew's performance with a superbly chosen supporting cast could not be a more perfect accoutrement to P.L. Traver's book. In many cases, movies made from books are a disappointment; not in this case. I am a younger 'old-school' Disney fan, and like very few of the Disney movies made after the 60's and 70's because I grew up watching films like Dumbo, Bambi, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty.

Now that I'm a parent, I see it's deeper meanings. Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews are truly fantastic in this film. I can't wait to share this with my son.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3BSS2M2DPPV4T	"""scotsladdie"""	"MARY POPPINS is a sheer delight no matter how many times you see it! This was Julie's ""consolation prize"" for not getting the role of Eliza Doolittle for the screen (alas, Audrey Hepburn played her). We will never know the sight of Andrews playing the lead in ""My Fair Lady"" on film, but we do know the sight of her playing Mary Poppins, and we love her (so did the academy!). The movie is very Disney, and done in such a grand way that you are taken directly into the charm of Edwardian London. Elsa Lanchester is very good (but all too brief ) as Katie Nana who informs Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns) that the children have disappeared again. The need for a new nanny is neccesary as Katie Nana leaves. Jane and Michael write on paper the attributes of which they seek in a nanny; this sheet of paper is angrily torn up as rubbish and thrown into the fireplace by their father George. Miraculously, the pieces of paper are reassembled and the magical Mary Poppins makes her appearance, with the children's requests in hand. The scene where all the waiting nannies fly away is hilarious as are the domestics Hermoine Baddeley and Reta Shaw as they rescue the vases etc., from the daily vibrations caused by an eccentric local firing a cannon.The children are properly English and really just a WEE bit naughty. Julie Andrews is terrific and Dick Van Dyke is very good as Bert, though his cockney accent is pure Hollywood. As a kid, the scene where Jane and Michael run into an old hag scared me, on recent viewing it was a lark. Jane Darwell, as the old bird woman is heartbreaking especially when that beautiful score is playing; it was her final role. Glynis Johns is a strangely irresponsible mother,but she was ahead of her time (1910) as a suffragette, David Tomlinson is stuffy and proper as the indifferent father. The choreography is first-rate and the songs are memorable.(Disney's very favorite of all his films was ""Tuppence a Bag"" however ""ChimChimCheree"" won the academy award as best song of 1964(!). The animation sequences are among the best ever put on film (it was always difficult to do animation scenes with live actors). This is widely regarded as Disney's masterpiece, it was certainly his most expensive film, and it grossed many times it's cost. Disney got the idea for Mary Poppins when, in the late 40's he would hear his daughter giggling constantly while reading the books by P.L. Travers; he put the idea on the shelf and he filmed his masterpiece fifteen years later!"	5.0	FANTASTIC ENTERTAINMENT.	1999-11-29	0	0	0
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	ARAS5VERQ8BH2	Scott Baret	It doesn't matter if you're 7 or 70. This movie pleases everyone. It's got a great soundtrack (don't know if it's still available but I inherited my mom's old LP record!), great acting (anything with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke has to be good), and has some scenes where live action and animation are combined. This was all done without the technology of today, yet another reason to appreciate the work in this film. The remastered DVD editions are great. Not sure what extras come with the newest one but the one I saw in 2001 had a good section about the making of the film.I recommend this to anyone, and it will come as a blessing if you're sick of the garbage that Hollywood is making today.	5.0	Now THIS is what I call a movie!	2005-05-05	3	2	1

It was our first time alone in the theater and we felt so grown up.This movie was so full of surprises and has always been my second most favorite movie (after the Wizard of Oz.)  Julie Andrews was the most perfect nanny ever.  I've always wonder why our babysitters never carried a magic bag.  I remember going home and trying to snap my fingers to clean up my room.  My shock that my toys and clothes didn't move on their own.  The music was wonderful and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious was the biggest song hit in school (sung is just about every school's concert in our town.)This movie was full of magic.  It allow us to dream that things were possible.  Even when the grownups didn't understand, you knew that there was magic all around.  I am so thrill for the 40th anniversary and will get this.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2B7BUH8834Y6M	"Shelley Gammon ""Geek"""	This is a 5-star movie crammed into a 1-star DVD. If you're renting a movie, you only plan on seeing it once... when you buy a movie, you have bought the right to see it whenever you please for as long as you want.  This DVD has FORCED COMMERCIALS! You can not skip them and you are forced to fast-forward through them.  Instead of endearing you to the movies featured in the trailers, you eventually get so mad that the thought of those films makes your blood boil... especially if you already have purchased those films on DVD and you don't need to be coerced into buying them in the first place.There is no excuse for this. Disney should offer refunds and/or replacement discs to those who purchased them on good faith.In addition to the forced commercials, the tech specs are misleading and plain wrong. While the film is widescreen, it is NOT anamorphic as is claimed... this means that while it is in letterbox format, it is not in proper proportion and the images are slightly distorted.Just throwing a movie on a round disk does not a DVD make and this is proof.The movie is fantastic despite these shortcomings... but as the title of this review states - this is a DVD review, not the film. I'd advise waiting until a collector's edition comes out. A collector's edition is likely to contain more features such as interviews with the cast, out-takes and scenes from the Oscars for that year... and (one can only pray) no forced commercials.	1.0	A DVD review	2002-08-05	134	103	31

Disney's eye for talent was magnificent. Miss Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson, and Glynis Jones were the only people imaginable for the parts. The movie was made from Walt's favorite book of the same name. PL Travers wrote the books, I highly recommend reading them.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1ZU4ESC3VFUAI	SitcomsGuru93	For over 50 years, Mary Poppins has defined Disney Magic and is an excellent film.Partly based on P.L. Travers' childhood, but more fictionalized.A hard-working man with a suffrage wife, two domestics and two unruly children must seek help in raising his children whose nanny has quit. Originally his choice for a nanny isn't what the children have in mind. However, out of the blue comes a beautiful woman by the name of &#34;Mary Poppins&#34;, and while she takes the children on unbelievable outings she teaches them how to behave properly, and opens their father's eyes and makes him realize love is more powerful than money.With Five Academy Awards, catchy songs from the Sherman Brothers and outstanding performances from Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. &#34;Mary Poppins&#34; is fun from start to finish, and you'll find yourself singing to the songs &#34;Spoonful of Sugar&#34; and &#34;Chim Chim Che-ree&#34;.While P.L. Travers despised the film years later, it has remained a staple in many childhoods and is a must see for anyone who is a child or a kid at heart.	5.0	Truly Walt Disney's Crowning Achievement.	2014-04-30	0	0	0

Today in our society there are plenty of negative influences once your kids, or any kid gets into middle school or earlier, but the best brain growth is even before that. Why not take advantage of this time and get them something wonderful and positive and affirming!?!!! This is such a great story and it and the songs will stick with your children or any children giving them something to sing and play with. Not only that, but this is the type of movie that can be watched over and over again for enjoyment to give your kids simply something to do! I highly recommend this classic movie to anyone with kids or as a gift to anyone that has them!

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1GYR0Q9BRCNQ4	slkx	I hear there are two versions of Mary Poppins' DVD going around - a single layer and a dual layer version.I unfortunately and unknowingly bought the single layer. Middle of the movie, it stops dead, an animated hand appears showing a disc being turned over and you have to leap up and flip your disc for the movie to resume. This is almost sacriledge in any movie but to do it in Mary Poppins is a crime. It kills the flow and destroys the magic. It should be clearly marked on the label if you have to flip your disc.So be warned all: check if you are getting the dual layer version on any long movie. If not, do not buy it.	2.0	Disappointed	2002-03-31	37	31	6

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2HL12DBLNZYJ6	"Software Engineer ""See"""	"One of my favorite movies and every family should own a copy, but I'm still hoping for a release that has the original release's 1.75 aspect ratio. Until then, I'm hanging on to my copy of the 2000 Gold Collection DVD with the 1.85 aspect ratio. All discs released since then have a 1.66 aspect ratio which crops the image on the sides, which is particularly noticeable in certain scenes such as with the penguins and the kite flying. The 1.85 aspect ratio isn't perfect as there is some cropping on top and bottom, but to my eye it is not as disruptive as the cropping on the sides. Too bad the 50th anniversary edition is still 1.66, but maybe there'll be a Platinum Edition with 1.85? Maybe in the 60th anniversary edition?UPDATE 01/13/2014: I did a side-by-side comparison of the 50th Edition 2013 DVD vs. the Blu-ray and there is a little less cropping of the top and bottom in the Blu-ray. So if you can't get the 2000 Gold DVD, the 2013 Blu-ray appears be better than the DVDs after 2000.FYI, there is also an Amazon Instant Video available in HD, i.e., 16:9, so you might think, ""Aha, 16:9 is 1.78! That must be better!"" But sadly, no. It is the same as the 2013 DVD release further cropped and magnified to fill a 16:9 screen. In other words, the streaming version crops even more of the top and bottom than the DVD version which already crops the top, bottom, and sides.All that said, the movie is still amazing in every edition and most will not notice nor miss the cropped edges. And I recognize some, probably the majority, even prefer cropping to fit the screen over the ""black bars"" on top and bottom. But for those who want to see as much of each shot as possible, hopefully this review saves them a little trouble."	5.0	Gold Collection DVD has a better aspect ratio (1.85) than later disc releases (2004, 2009, 2013)	2014-01-11	2	2	0

As usual, he's right. Nearly all successful childrens films, books, etc...have something to do with the supra-natural. Witchcraft usually. Mary Poppins is the nicest witch ever. She crafts order from chaos, turns brats into nice children, and turns real life into a happy cartoon. The songs are ageless, timeless, and charming. Mary Poppins is a very powerful witch indeed! I'm sure that children will be spellbound and unable to unglue thier little eyes from the screen. For older people like me, I am way impressed by the seamless special effect; for example, Mary's carpet bag that's deep enough to hold a 7' lamp, other furnishings too, but her bag is only about 14"" deep. I think it would have made a good series watching Mary go from house to house in ancient England rescuing needy families. Engaging and lovely.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A398BJNQJ524MP	"Stephen Dobbins ""Drummer Boy"""	First Of All, Disney Did Mary Poppins A Dishoner in my opinion. They put out a Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix That Does Nothing To Enhance The Sound but add a bunch of reverb in the rear speakers and actually muddles the sound in my opinoin. Then they went and sweetened the sound effects by adding sounds that weren't in the original movie audio track. This is a no no! You don't Tamper with the original sound. All the sounds you hear must be faithful to the original film nothing added and nothing taken away. The original 2 channel audio track is the best sounding audio track on this release. Now if you still want my opinion, an earlier release of the film called the Mary Poppins Gold Classic Collection that was released in the 90's had the best audio track on it. Why disney didn't include this track I don't know but all the sounds were seperated and placed in individual speakers and no sweetening or reverb was added to the sound. Only this Gold Classic 90's Version of The release did not have 16x9 enhanced widescreen. Oh the film was presented in it's original widescreen but not enhanced to fit a widescreen TV. So as a consumer you are better off with the 40th anniversary edition. And one note, go into the audio settings and change the audio to the original 2 channel stereo and you'll get much better sound over the other choices unfortionatly. Not 5.1 surround but its better than the other 2 disney enhanced home theater mixes. Plus one more thing Disney did a dishoner with was removing the original Buena Vista Fanfare at the beginning of the movie in the 40th and 45th Anniversary Editions. Shame On you Disney.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	AT07UZQQR7ZEH	"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov..."	"Is there anyone left on the planet who does not know MARY POPPINS?  Made in 1963-1964, after a thirty year battle to convince a very stubborn and possessive P. L.  Travers  to give Walt Disney the rights to her book(s), it may be the Disney Studios' crowning film achievement.  It is a wonderful movie, a flawless blend of live action and animation, with some of the most beautiful and detailed matte paintings in movie history.  Julie Andrews, who won a Best Actress Oscar in her film debut, is the perfect nanny in 1910 Edwardian England to Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber).  And the movie won four other technical and music Oscars, with a still untopped thirteen total nominations.With chimney sweep/street artist/best buddy Bert (Dick Van Dyke in peak form), Mary Poppins leads Jane and Michael on many magical adventures.  These include a live-action/animation day in the park (""Supercalifragilisticexpealidocis""), a tea party on a ceiling with Ed Wynn as Uncle Albert, the hauntingly beautiful ""Feed the Birds"" with bird woman Jane Darwell, and the Oscar-winning ""Chim-Chim-Curree"" on the rooftops of London.  (Peter Ellenshaw allegedly did 100 breathtakingly beautiful and detailed matte paintings for this movie, winning a well-deserved visual effects Oscar.Meanwhile, the Banks family is controlled like clockwork by Mr. Banks (a perfectly cold and stuffy David Tomlinson, who turns 180 degrees over the movie's fast-paced 140 minutes.  (Cotton Warburton won an Editing Oscar.)  Glynis Johns is an ideal and likeable suffragette and feminist Mrs. Banks.  Mr. Banks works in the bank and constantly wants his kids to open a bank account, but they are always off playing with Mary Poppins or  Bert.MARY POPPINS is a fabulous feast of a movie, with some of the greatest visual effects and most beautiful matte paintings I have ever seen.  The cast is perfection, the writing something that even grouchy Pamela Travers should be pleased with.  And the 40th anniversary restoration on DVD has shimmeringly rich color, crystal-clear image clarity, and awesome 5.1 Home Theatre Mix THX sound to top any theater sound system.Disk 2 runs over three hours and includes composer Richard Sherman giving us deleted songs that ended up in other Disney animated movies, were cut for sheer length on a movie that runs almost two-and-a-half hours without them, and chats with Julie Andrews and Dick Andrews.  A full hour behind-the-scenes documentary shows how most of the magnificent visual effects were achieved, should you want the illusion spoiled.  We see the battle to get P.L. Travers to let Walt Disney film her precious baby of a novel over three full decades and working over the screenplay to make it all seamless plot-wise.  Finally, we have long lost footage of the Grauman's Chinese Theatre Los Angeles world premiere in August 1964 and various movie trailers for those who want to know how this very magical masterpiece was marketed.The two-disk 40th anniversary DVD of MARY POPPINS belongs in every house with kids--and kids at  heart.  With it, a hundred filmmaking aspects come together perfectly to create a masterpiece that gets my vote as Walt Disney's crowning film achievement."	5.0	Walt Disney's crowning film achievement	2006-08-10	3	3	0
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS	Stephen M. Lerch	The DVD release of Mary Poppins, to quote another bit of the film, is practically perfect in every way. The video is crisp and clear with only a small hint of edge enhancement. There are maybe 2 specks of dust/dirt on the entire 139 minute film. Simply amazing for a film this old.The audio has been enhanced for a Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, can also be watched in an enhanced stereo mix or can even be watched in the original theatrical release's stereo mix. Can also be watched in French and Spanish. English subtitles are available for the hard of hearing, or the odd person who wishes to watch the movie in a foreign language they don't know. Since I'm not sure where else to include it with my review, there is also a commentary from Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews.For the Mary Poppins fan, there is a tremendous amount of bonus material. On the second disc there is a 50 minute making of, 10 minute short, several clips on how scenes were made and a round table (actually, around a piano) discussion with Dick Van Dyke, Julie Andrews and Richard Sherman. There is a game to be played for children and a lot of other material. A bonus on the first disc (the feature) is the ability to watch with fun pop-up facts that give you interesting information about certain scenes.Having been one to have never seen the movie all the way through, and having only ever sat through bits and pieces, I wasn't sure what to expect when I began watching. I was blown away. Even if a person can't appreciate the imaginative brilliance of the film, they should be able to see the technical brilliance of the special effects. Mary pulling various, larger than the bag items from her carpet bag, the near seamless integration of animation and live action and the amount of work needed to choreograph all of the dance moves. This movie puts some of the CG work done today to shame. George Lucas should take notes from this film to make his works actually worth watching.Watching this movie 40 years after it was made also drives home the fact that the Disney company has fallen a very long way. From a company about giving dreams and entertainment to children, to a company concerned only with the bottom line and the next gimmick. Walt Disney understood what the current Disney management does not, a good movie will make you money and is timeless. The amount of imagination that went into this film puts recent Disney fair to shame.I hate to admit it, but had I not received a promotional copy of this DVD, I probably never would have watched it. Having now seen it, I would have been doing myself a huge disservice not watching it. For those that feel that this isn't there type of movie, simply watch with an open mind. I went expecting to turn it off after 15 minutes, what I ended up doing was watching the entire 139 minute film and not even realizing 2 hours and 20 minutes had even passed.Highly recommended for Mary Poppins fans and film fans. If you don't like musicals, this movie definitely isn't for you.	5.0	Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious	2004-12-08	2	2	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	AGRR05FH945HR	Steven Cain	Finally a DVD package that is worthy of this Disney masterpiece, and one that takes you behind the scenes with the truly incomparable Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke.While they each made many memorable movies, this is one that really showcases their almost unique combination of talents. I seriously doubt that there was another couple in Hollywood who could have even done half the job that Dick and Julie did in this utter classic.This is one of those rare movies that really is as good as you have heard. While I think it was Variety magazine at the time who described the English accents as 'lamentable', for me, as a former Brit, they almost add to the charm, guv'nor.A cast made in heaven, stunning sets, costumes, impeccable direction and production, some of the best songs and dance routines you could possibly wish for - Van Dyke's sheer genius is a joy to behold - all add up to one magical experience that simply should not be missed.Julie also worked closely with the brilliant Pamela Travers in order to do justice to the author's creation, and the two really hit it off. The results of her thoughtful collaboration are here to see and savor.Whether you see the movie as Pamela's homage to the transforming power of the Feminine on the eve of woman suffrage, or just a stunning piece of solid family entertainment (and we could sure use a whole lot more of that, especially these days) Mary Poppins delivers beyond your wildest dreams.It may be a no brainer to say this, but for more Julie, The Sound Of Music is a must, and for another Dick Van Dyke showcase (including a masterful, complex dance routine), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is also essential viewing.Then of course, you should really watch the superb David Tomlinson and the divine Angela Lansbury in Bedknobs and Broomsticks... sigh... so much brilliance, so little time...This 40th anniversary (sheesh, I remember its original release) edition is a welcome boost for the Mary Poppins fans, and one that I simply cannot fault. Two absolutely magical people; one absolutely magical movie.	5.0	The King and Queen of entertainment	2004-12-16	4	4	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	ASEBX8TBYWQWA	"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon..."	FIRST an important note: Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together. This means that reviews posted five years ago are grouped in the 800+ reviews on now for this title. I always recommend that, when reading Amazon reviews, you 1) look at the product that the reviewer is commenting on (it&#8217;s listed) and also the date of the review. (You can sort by &#8220;newest first&#8221;. With that said, on to my review of the 50th Anniversary RESTORED Blu-ray Combo.Disney repackagings it&#8217;s classic films about every 10 years for their &#8220;Anniversary Editions&#8221;.  They usually add a new &#8220;special feature&#8221; or two and repeat the ones from prior editions. For the first Blu-ray release of MP they went the extra step and digitally remastered the film. They did an amazing job on it and, even on a basic HD flat screen TV &#8211; the images are super sharp and the colors brilliant.There were two reasons to release this &#8220;Special Edition&#8221; now (three, if you consider that it&#8217;s Christmas gift time). One is the 50th anniversary of the film&#8217;s release (which is stretching it a bit since the 50th won&#8217;t come until next year (2014). The other is the December 2013 release of the Disney feature film &#8220;Saving Mr. Banks&#8221; about the making of MP. And, trust me, Disney did not miss this opportunity to cross-market both films. The &#8220;Exciting New Content&#8221; on this 2013 package includes &#8220;Becoming Mr. Sherman&#8221; an new 11-minute featurette with actor Jason Schwartzman (who plays composer Richard Sherman in SMB) chatting with the real Richard Sherman. I can already see this being a &#8220;bonus&#8221; on the SMB DVD when it is released in 2014. This is followed by the 2 1/2 &#8211;minute &#8220;trailer&#8221; for SMB. The other &#8220;Exciting New Content&#8221; is the &#8220;Mary-oke&#8221; which shows the animated lyrics to four songs on the screen so you can sing along.All the other bonues (and there are many) are carried over from prior editions and titled &#8220;Classic Bonuses&#8221;. These include a 48 minute feature on bringing MP to Broadway (with the full 7-minute production number of &#8220;Step In Time&#8221;), a 50-minute &#8220;Making of&#8221; the film featurette, A 9-minute Pl&#62; Travers story told by Julie Andrews and a full length commentary with Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and Richard Sherman. Considering that the film runs 2  hours, this means that there is over SEVEN-HOURS (!) of entertainment on this BD.You may already own a copy of the earlier edition and not need the &#8220;Classic Bonuses&#8221; again. And the &#8220;Becoming Mr. Sherman&#8221; bonus is really an infomercial for SMB (which I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing next week), but if you have a Bluray player, I feel it&#8217;s worth upgrading to this new edition, if only to enjoy the new crisp images from the latest restoration. (Then give your older edition to someone who has yet to experience the magic of this film.)I&#8217;ll end by saying that the film is not just for children. There are moments of humor that only an adult will notice and &#8211; until I watched it again yesterday &#8211; I didn&#8217;t realize how little dialogue there is in the film; it&#8217;s mostly songs and production numbers! This film is not only timeless, but ageless too.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful!Steve Ramm	5.0	Bluray Review: Disney&#8217;s Brilliant masterpiece in BRILLIANT new restored BD	2013-12-15	34	31	3

This film, of both live action and animation, is guaranteed to keep a person of any age mystified through all 139 minutes of fun and music.This film was the winner of five Academy Awards, including Best Actress (Julie Andrews), Best Song (Chim Chim Cher-ee), and Best Visual Effects.I give this film five stars because it can be enjoyed by audiences of any age.  It is also enjoyed as much today as it was on its original release date of 1964.  In a nut shell, this Walt Disney Production is ""practically perfect in every way!!"""	5.0	Practically Perfect In Every Way	2003-09-06	2	2	0

No grain, no film flaws, nothing of the sort. Colors are vibrant, the audio is clear and crisp, and it's the best this movie's ever looked or sounded. The songs will sound nothing short of spectacular while special effects sequences will still be as magical as ever.The bonus features are excellent and this DVD boasts some of the best bonuses ever for a non-Platinum Disney DVD. You have an INCREDIBLE making-of documentary that totally goes in-depth and is not at all fluffy. The short The Cat That Looked At A King is charming and a wonderful watch. The Musical Reunion and Musical Journey featurettes are both charming to watch. There's lots of footage from the world premiere, still art galleries, publicity materials, and more.In addition to this DVD, Disney also released a 2-CD Special Edition soundtrack. Disc 1 boasts the most complete soundtrack album ever available. Disc 2 contains all kinds of bonus materials. The packaging and content is truly excellent.I can't find any fault with this DVD or the Special Edition soundtrack.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2MYUI8IT6UBUU	"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com"""	"One of Disney's very best musicals, Mary Poppins is an unforgettable children's classic. It combines memorable songs that get stuck in your head with the forward and sarcastic dialogue of the unsurpassable Poppins, and a psychedelic story that employs superbly integrated traditionally animated characters. Part fairy tale, part daydream, and all magic, the sights, songs and laughs propel this Academy Award-winning picture (Andrews took home the Oscar for Best Actress, and the film was nominated for a whopping 13 golden boys - the most of any Disney film) to the top of the lists for the greatest family films ever made.The story begins with Bert (Dick Van Dyke) playing the role of guide and narrator, ushering the viewer to the home at 17 Cherry Tree Lane (as if inexperienced in the technique, the camera cuts on several occasions during the trip, taking the viewer out of the notion of following Bert). The sixth nanny in four months is about to dash out the door, upset at the constantly preoccupied Winifred Banks and her two misbehaving children who have once again gone missing. When Mr. George Banks (David Tomlinson) comes home, he's furious at the disorder, blames the kids and his wife, and insists upon personally hiring the next nanny. The two children, Jane and Michael, create their own list of requirements for the prospective woman, but George scoffs and throws the paper into the fireplace.The following morning, dozens of elderly ladies line the front yard, waiting for an interview for the newly open position. But with a powerful gust of wind, the lot of them is replaced by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews), who descends from the clouds with her umbrella and carpetbag and, mysteriously, the children's list of preferences. Banks is all seriousness and professionalism, but he's no match for the tricky verbal wizardry of Poppins, who not only hires herself, but initially agrees only to a trial run. After dismissing the befuddled man of the house, she slides up the staircase (in a peculiarly reverse Exorcist-like manner) to meet the children, and unpack her empty carpetbag (pulling out a hat rack, mirror, lamp and more).Poppins uses magic and singing (starting off with the very famous ""A Spoonful of Sugar"" song) to tidy up their room (tables, toys and doors all flap about in another playful scene reminiscent of The Exorcist), and the trio departs for the park. There they meet Bert, who is creating chalk masterpieces on the sidewalk, and with a little more magical help from Mary Poppins, embark on a fun-filled adventure into his artwork - firstly on a jolly holiday in a picturesque English countryside (the kids are curiously absent for the first two lengthy sequences with dancing penguins and barnyard animals) which segues into a merry-go-round horse ride through the park that transforms into a fox hunt and then a derby.At first it seems that practically perfect (and rather vain) Mary Poppins is there to straighten out the wily kids; as the film progresses it's evident that Mr. and Mrs. Banks are the ones she's there to fix; George is a well-ordered man absorbed with his work, and rarely has time for his children and their unseemly hullabaloo (or the sugary female thinking of his wife), while Winifred is leading women's rights movements - an act contrary to her subservient attitude toward her husband.A cheerful creativity surrounds the whole film, from the laugh-filled tea party on the ceiling of Uncle Albert's home, to the senile but punctual admiral who commands a ship atop his house, to the tongue-twisting silliness of ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious."" The songs are some of the best in any of Disney's films, the mixing of traditional animation with the live action characters is fantastic, and Andrews' performance is (spit) spot-on. Although the running time is noticeably lengthy for a family film (the following year's The Sound of Music was, of course, even longer) and the scripting of Poppins changed drastically from the original story by P.L. Travers (for the better), it is one of the most memorable and delightful musicals from Walt Disney - one that hasn't aged and remains universally entertaining.- Mike Massie"	4.0	Mary Poppins Review from The Massie Twins	2009-01-29	2	2	0

Mary Poppins is the definitive musical fantasy that others tried to imitate. Evet song is a classic from the Oscar winning ""Chim Chim Cherrie"" to the final tune ""Lets go fly a kite"". One of the best routine was the chimminy sweep dance number where you had breathtaking view of the London skyline. Both Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke were at their musical best. The part where they were riding on the carousel horses is a pure classic.I am suprised this did not make AFI's top 100 movies list.

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) don't want another strict, unfriendly nanny. Their father (David Tomlinson), a banker, believes that they need discipline and strict guidance. Their mother (Glynnis Johns), a leader of the Women's Suffragette movement, seems to agree with the children, but can't really say so. The next morning, Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) arrives and takes the job, based on an advertisement the children wrote. Soon, she is leading the children in song, displaying her magical spells and clearly enchanting the children in each and every way. She introduces the children to Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a street performer who seems to have some history with Mary and they are off on a magical journey.""Mary Poppins"", released in 1964, represented a magical blend of live action and animation that, at the time, was technologically very advanced. Disney just released a 40th Anniversary DVD, complete with a second disc of interesting extras.Watching the film again, I was struck by how rudimentary the special effects seemed. Then, remembering that this film was made in 1964, these same special effects became charming and wholly fitting for the story. The story is told through the eyes of the Banks children, and the use of these special effects helps to put us in their shoes. The story is set in Victorian England and it seems completely realistic that children in this era would see toy soldier marching into a toy box (stop motion), jump into a chalk drawing (2D animation) and watch their nanny sing to a bird (animatronics). The outdated look of these effects serves the point of view of the story beautifully and adds to the charm of it. We actually get a feeling that we are looking at a picture book as we watch the film. I can't even imagine how slick and uninviting the same film would be if it were made today, with CGI special effects coming out of the woodwork.Yes, the film is very saccharin at times, but this helps to define the viewpoint of the children as well. The story is told through their eyes. The struggles of their mother to win `the vote', their father's troubles at the bank, life in England at the turn of the 20th Century, are not going to be delved into too deeply. The children don't know about these problems. If the film started dealing with the mother's attempts to lead the suffragette movement, for instance, the viewpoint and the story would become off-balance.One of the most delightful things about ""Mary Poppins"" is the musical score containing many classic songs.  I've seen this film, or parts of it, dozens of times over the years. I think that even if you have seen it only once or twice, you probably remember many of the songs. ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"", ""Step In Time"", ""Spoonful of Sugar"", ""Jolly Holiday"" and ""Perfect Nanny"" are all songs that I remember, and I can even sing a couple of lines for most. The true mark of a good Broadway musical is that you leave the theater humming the tunes. The same holds true for a musical film. All of the best musicals remain classics because we remember the songs. The Sherman Brothers created a great score of music and songs all of which served to enhance and supplement the story.Watching the DVD, the second disc contains a making of documentary, a musical reminiscence with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and the surviving Sherman brother, a new animated short with Julie Andrews taking her grandchildren into a new chalk painting where they meet ""The Cat That Looked Like A King"" and more. There is also a brief featurette showing how the live action photography of Van Dyke and Andrews walking along the path for the ""Jolly Holiday"" number and the live action photography of ""Step in Time"" was superimposed with animation. While watching the making of documentary, I learned an interesting fact. Disney wanted the film to look like a Broadway play. All of the sets were fabricated on sound stages, adding to the idealized look of the entire film. ""Chimpanzoo"", a deleted song is also included. Sung by Richard Sherman and illustrated by story boards for the deleted sequence, presumably, it would have been part of the ""Jolly Holiday"" number. It is probably better that it was left out of the film.There are a lot more features on the second disc, too many to list. As is the case with the best Disney DVDs, it appears that they have included everything they could get their hands on. This makes the DVD a must-have for film scholars and collectors. Essentially, the best Disney DVDs are encyclopedias on the making of the films. Filmmakers, enthusiasts and scholars have the opportunity to learn so much from these DVDs, even if a lot of the material is sugar-coated.This is Julie Andrews's first film. Before this, she appeared on Broadway and in a television version of ""Cinderella"". It is a truly remarkable, accomplished performance, amazing for someone acting in their first film. Andrews brings just the right blend of friendship, guidance and stern leadership to the role. Hand in hand as she enchants the children, she appears slightly annoyed at various points. And what is the relationship between her and Bert? These are questions left unanswered by the film, thankfully. If they were to remake this film, the filmmakers would probably feel it necessary to make her a former barmaid or tarted up boozer, make her back-story more explicit.Dick Van Dyke was a more established star at the time. His television show was in full swing and he had previously appeared in the Broadway and film versions of ""Bye Bye Birdie"". It might seem strange that a rising star would take what is essentially a supporting role, but I think he made a wise choice. He brings an unabashed enthusiasm to the role which is also very fitting. The entire film is meant to be seen through the eyes of Jane and Michael. Naturally, they would see a character like Bert as the neatest guy in the world. Van Dyke created a role that he will always be remembered for.""Mary Poppins"" is a classic. Every spoon full of sugar helps the film remain a classic in each and every way."	4.0	Great In Each and Every Way	2005-04-07	7	6	1

Yeah yeah, I have no soul or heart, but I just don't like this film one bit. I can't stand it when musicals come up with a musical number every five minutes. Musicals that do really annoy me, and this is an example. There's always talk that this movie was famous for combing live action and animation. but that's only for what--ten to fifteen minutes? There's no adventure, no heartwarming, it''s just people singing pointlessly. I remember getting bored with this utterly ridiculous movie. I'm not much a fan of the Sherman Brothers, or at least not in THIS movie.  Mary Poppins herself is not an interesting character, correcting poor Michael when he's not perfect, just acting firm most of the time. I am definetly never going to buy this movie."	2.0	Mediocre Movie	2012-12-18	10	0	10

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ	Todd7	This 1964 Disney masterpiece has it all: great music, great dancing, great acting, good animation, character development, humor, charm, and a unique story. I won't delve into the plot, but rather want to focus on the aforementioned attributes. The film features some of the all-time classic songs, which add warmth to the experience. The acting is superb, with a vivacious Julie Andrews as the perfect choice in her role, as is the charming Dick Van Dyke. The actors in this movie mesh, which generates great character development, thus moving the story along. Mary Poppins is a balanced movie that's anchored by a great and unique story that touches our senses and leaves a lasting impression.

How many classic films from decades past have both stars doing the commentary?  Not to mention Karen Dotrice (who played Jane Banks), who adds another charming touch, and a moving tribute to Matthew Garber, her sibling in the film, who died of complications of Hepatitis acquired while traveling in India.But there's more:  a documentary entitled ""Disney on Broadway"" provides a fascinating behind the scenes look at the craftsmen who adapted P.L. Travers work to a new venue:  the stage.  While obviously a bit of a puff piece, and there's a whiff of self-congratulation here and there, frankly, much of the pride here is well deserved.  Travers' well known scorn for certain aspects of Disney's film is well known.  How Disney Exec Thomas Schumacher and producer Cameron Macintosh finessed the great dame into giving them the rights makes for interesting viewing.A last point-- so often when we are offered a glimpse behind the scenes, we find out that a magical film wasn't always so magical for those involved in the creation of it.  Not see here.  For everyone involved in this production (and everyone seems charming)  it seems to remain a high point in their lives.  Disney magic indeed.

The kids started watching it immediately and I loved listening to them sing my favorite songs from the movie.  Ten days later on a rainy Sunday we popped it in the DVD player as a family and watched it on the big HDTV in the living room.I was amazed at the color, the skin tones and the digital remix of the score.  I felt just as excited as the first time I saw it,  was shocked at Dick Van Dyke's blue eyes, the creamy complexion of Julie Andrews and the sheer fun of this movie.And my technie kids loved the story - ""T'uPence never fails to make them sad about the pigeons at St. Mark's Square and I love that as a mother I'm sharing some of my own childhood.PS - my son wants to be a chimney sweep!"	5.0	A Classic to be shared	2008-03-18	1	1	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	AY6A8KPYCE6B0	Tyson	I was always a Mary Poppins fan as a child, but thanks to the new Saving Mr. Banks movie I've been re-obsessing myself with her. To prepare myself for a full Mary Poppins experience, I read theoriginal books, watched Saving Mr. Banks, and finally popped in the new Blu Ray transfer of this iconic movie. Combined, the grandeur of Mary Poppins had me in tears. There is something about her, both Disney's and Travers' versions of her, that embodies imagination and seems to be both the essence of jollity and the earnestness of tragedy. Having read the books, I understand why Travers did not want her Poppins to receive the Disney treatment, but unlike her, I believe the adaptation was a brilliant work of art that added dimension to the books rather than take them away.As for the Blu Ray itself, I found the transfer to be exquisite. There's no question that the movie has never looked or sounded this fantastic on home media before. The half-animation half-live action sequences were even more magical than I remember as a child. I was afraid the added HD would reveal some of the '60s special effects, but actually they still boggle my mind even by today's standards. The soundtrack includes some of the best songs from any musical, ever.OVERALL: The story and back-story of Mary Poppins is nearly as incredible as the film itself. It's a miracle the film was ever made, but were it not for Travers' disagreeable critiques and prolonged refusal to sell the rights, there's no doubt in my mind that the movie would not have been nearly as good as it was. The improved special effects, Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, the Sherman Brothers, Walt himself, who must have realized that his own death wouldn't be far off - it was a symphony of extraordinary talent that happened to come together and create one of the masterpieces of cinema. And were it not for Poppins, it is unlikely that we would have Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music. For art lovers, all this history is positively juicy. If you've seen this movie before, even if it was years ago, I definitely recommend reading the books and watching Saving Mr. Banks before re-watching, but either way, Mary Poppins is a classic and will be cherished by everyone.	5.0	Gorgeous Blu Ray - Unforgettable Movie	2014-01-04	2	2	0

Who wouldn't like a carpetbag like hers?The favourite song of the movie is ""Step In Time"" performed on the rooftops of London by the ensemble of chimney sweeps. At the start of the song it's all hands on deck in my household, as we all have to get up and dance furiously to Dick Van Dyke's instructions (a hilarious sight when a twenty month old is involved).This is sure to be a hit with kids of all ages as indeed, it has proven for over 36 years."	5.0	A Big Winner With the Kids	2001-08-05	3	2	1

For one, the Mary Poppins of the books is  much more prim and prissy and proper than the Poppins played by Julie  Andrews in the movie. There are four children in the first book (Jane,  Michael, John and Barbara) and a fifth (Annabel) comes along in the next  book. Some of the books also read more like a series of incidents than a  tightly-knit story. The movie tells a definite story: of how a father who  is estranged from his children gets re-united with them through all the  strange and wonderful things that occur when the perfect nanny with magical  powers literally blows into their house with the east wind.  Some incidents  from the books that are portrayed as written, others changed to suit the  movie.  When the movie deviates greatly from the book it is based on, I  haved liked the books far more than the movie. &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; is  the exception, where I feel the books and the movie have their own (and  very different) charm. Julie Andrews is terrific, the setting of Edwardian  London great, the songs are fabulous, and this is a movie to be treasured  and seen over and over again down the years.	5.0	A movie destined to last through the years	2000-07-25	3	2	1

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A2E6D0N0N8QK35	Wayne Best	After watching 'Saving Mr. Banks' I pulled out an old 'taped it myself off TV' copy of &#34;Mary Poppins&#34;.  My copy wasn't very good by today's standards, so I sprung for a new movie.  There are lots of cheery tunes.  I'm happy with my choice.	4.0	New interest in this movie from watching 'Saving Mr. Banks'	2014-03-27	0	0	0
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A30QHCLJQ4FC6L	Wayne Hogan	Watched after seeing Saving Mr. Banks at theatre.  Though I'd see a movie the the writer had described in the movie (little to no animation, characters true to her vision).  I know the anime was very cutting edge for it's time, but most of the movie appeared to be nothing but a showcase for that anime with scenes running WAY too long than needed to tell the story.  And in the end, Mr. Banks goes right back to what was causing him so much distress.  My Mom also watched this movie and had a similar response.  So it didn't work for either generation.This would be a good movie to watch to see what was cutting edge at the time, but be prepared for a long boring movie.  In my opinion.	1.0	Boring long songs.	2014-01-12	13	1	12

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	A1Q15TP2FXYYMF	"www.steveo2006.co.uk ""Steveo"""	"The Banks family is in need of a new nanny for Jane and Michael. Fortunately, one arrives on the wind in the form of Mary Poppins. She's everything the kids want, fun and magical. But while she's taking them to chalk painting countrysides and tea parties on the ceiling, their father is less then happy. Can he be made to see beyond the end of his nose?Ok, so this movie is really little more then an excuse for song and dance numbers. It's still great! The plot is paper thin, and you loose site of it in the middle of some of their fantastic scenes. Of course, part of that is because the movie is based on a book that is really nothing but short stories. Still this movie is more about fun then anything else. And it has that in spades. What kid wouldn't have fun imaging that they get to do all the things that Jane and Michael do in this movie?It's said that Walt Disney poured everything he had learned into making this film, and it shows. Many of the special effects hold up remarkably well today. There were some I still hadn't figured out until watching this special edition. And the music! Any fan of Disney knows these songs by heart. And you can't help but find yourself humming ""A Spoonful of Sugar,"" ""Jolly Holiday,"" ""Let's Go Fly a Kite,"" or ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"" for days after seeing it.Those wanting to own a great DVD of this film won't be disappointed in this two-disc set. Disc one features the movie in all its wide screen glory. I can't see how it's ever looked better. The soundtrack has many different options, but the Home Theater mix will blow you away. It's fantastic. There is also a commentary track featuring Julie Andrews, Dick van Dyke, Karen Dubice (Jane), and Richard Sherman. Sprinkled in are archive comments from others, including Disney himself. Also included are some pop up facts to read along with while watching the movie. Disc two features a new documentary on the film, a deleted song, and more on the music with Julie, Dick, and the composers. And be sure to check out the animated ""The Cat That Looked at a King,"" a tale adapted from one of the later books in the series.One thing that comes through loud and clear in this set is how much fun everyone had making it and how much they respect Walt Disney. The fact that this film has lasted 40 years is testament to his genius. With this set, it'll be enjoyed by generations to come."	5.0	Practically Perfect In Every Way	2006-06-11	3	3	0

6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	AB2AQMK9PCWWX	"yygsgsdrassil ""yygsgsdrassil"""	....my only beef with Mary Poppins is not with the story and concept itself, it's with the Disney people who knew how to exploit the American tendency to place evvy thing European in on a higher level than evvy thing else, so that Poppins' British &quot;perfect in every way&quot; attributes, which were meant to be veddy, veddy tongue-in-cheek and cheeky (look under &quot;Irony&quot; and &quot;Satire&quot;, kiddies.) were taken way too seriously. And  too many people tried to emulate her. Disney brought this out on the cusp of the British Rock 'n Roll Invasion, Barnaby Street, the Mods, all that.  So that Veddy &quot;Brit&quot; was Veddy &quot;In&quot;....Not only did Julie Andrews tried to fight typecasting of a sweet and perfect image from this and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; with very un-Mary Poppins roles like in the movie &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; and &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot;, she tried to murder the image by baring all in her husbands' production &quot;S.O.B.&quot;(A perverse part of me wishes Andrews would bury the typecasting once and for all by showing up in a future Austin Powers moovy, but that's just how I think, folks.)...There ain't no Poppins, except in these fantasys....it's just a kiddies' story, folks!....and &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, to it's great credit, is magical. And it's musical. My favorite scene is the &quot;Step In Time&quot; production with Burt's chimney sweep buds...talk  about choreography! I know Van Dyke must've had a blast doing Burt and the decrepid, decaying banker--he was like a Rubber Band  Man, then (a Carl Reiner clone), and his faux Cockney had all the school kids wanting to be a &quot;matey&quot;, kinda like the way the Crocodile Hunter seduces kids with his Aussie ways.I had heard that the powers that be at Disney are gonna put out Poppins on a limited scale, in cinemas across the nation. The difference being that they plan to have the words to &quot;A Spoonful of Sugar&quot;,&quot;SupercalifragilisticexpiallIamtoolazytofinishthiscorrectly&quot;, &quot;Chim-chim Cheree&quot; and &quot;Let's go Fly A Kite&quot; across the bottom of the screen to encourage singing and cult-dom a la &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;...say what?  The Disney folks--at it again?Or mebbe it's because Disney has had the British children's story market covered for years with the likes of Poppins and Pooh and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and is looking for a bit of competition with the impending Harry Potter moovy and it's PR saturation. Hmmmm....&quot;On the rooftops of London, Coor--whatta site.&quot;	5.0	Spit-spot! A Low-Tech, Anti-Sorcery Harry Potter...	2001-03-08	4	1	3
6300274187	Mary Poppins [VHS]	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"Just recently, I watched this film with my younger sister, who is pretty much obsessed with the whole ""High School Musical"" phenomenon.  I wanted to show her the musical that defined MY childhood, but wasn't sure how she would react to the dated graphics and themes.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that she found the film to be very entertaining, from the goofy songs to the crazy characters to the wacky animation.In all honesty, though, what is not to like about this charming film?!  The areas in which the movie excels include:Plot: Simple enough (Nanny swoops down from above to take care of somewhat-neglected children) for children to understand, but with just enough political undertones to keep adults' attention, something that does not occur in HSM (in that series, either you buy into the catchy tunes or you don't...there's no middle ground).Acting: Julie Andrews (as Mary Poppins) and Dick Van Dyke (as chimney-sweep Bert) turn in incredible performances that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, and there isn't a member of the supporting cast that doesn't bring something interesting to the table.Music: Of course, a musical film is ultimately judged by the success of its musical numbers, and in that case ""Mary Poppins"" is a rousing success!  It would take too long to rate all the musical numbers in this movie, but suffice it to say that they offer something for everyone.  I personally love the chimney-sweep's ""Step In Time"" upbeat dance, while my younger sister's favorite was, as she would said, ""the one with the dancing penguins!"".Overall, ""Mary Poppins"" is a movie that can be enjoyed by any and all ages from now until the end of time.  Please watch the film to sustain your own craving for nostalgia, then introduce it to your children/relatives to show them that musicals need not be set in high school."	5.0	"It Doesn't Have To Be ""HSM"" For Kids To Like It"	2009-04-20	0	0	0
