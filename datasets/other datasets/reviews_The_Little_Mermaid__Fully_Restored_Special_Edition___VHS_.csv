Since watching the film, she has taken to leaning against large rocks (imitating Ariel when the ocean splashes up behind her as she poses on a rock), and singing to her toys.When I purchased the DVD, it was less than $15 (on amazon), at the time of this writing, the price has skyrocketed above $50.Another bonus, in addition to the added material contained on the disks, is the removal of the ""Phallic Symbol"" on the underwater castle, and the ""questionable accents"" on the pants of the priest who performs the wedding ceremony between The Prince and Ursula.It should be a crime to deny a child access to this wonderful story filled with beautiful songs and vivid imagery."	5.0	I've got gadgets and gizmo's aplenty...	2012-07-04	0	0	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3PFBH26G48ZOO	Aaron Bachler	I love the The Little Mermaid.  As a film, it's a true gem in the Disney vault.  The reason I gave it 3 stars is I bought the 3D version and was very disappointed.  I'm sure you're thinking &#34;well it wasn't made for the 3D&#34;.  That's very true, but there's been a few conversions of 2D to 3D that were amazing.  Finding Nemo comes to mind.  Disney should have left this one as a 2D film and saved people the extra money.	3.0	Great movie, terrible 3D	2013-11-08	1	1	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1IJKK6Q1GTEAY	A Customer	The Little Mermaid from Hans Christian Andersen is one of my favorite fairy tales and even though Disney changed the story and the ending of the fairy tale to give it a more happy Disneyish ending I still really loved this animated movie and thought it was such a nice, sweet, charming movie and I really liked Ariel, also I loved the songs especially Under The Sea! I reccomend this animated movie and also the Faerie Tale Theater version of The Little Mermaid starring Pam Dawber as the Mermaid, it was much closer to the classic Andersen tale and it kept the scary part with the Mermaid and the knife and the sad ending.	5.0	Not exactly the same as Andersen's tale but still Wonderful!	2002-01-05	0	0	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3BRND97LVLITA	Adam Cook	Many say that the Little Mermaid was the movie that restored the magic of Disney in its films.  This statement may not be enough.  The Little Mermaid is one of, if not the best movie Disney has made yet.  The animation is a little inferior to recent movies such as Beauty and the Beast and the Lion King.  However, the Little Mermaid makes a connection with its characters and the audience like no other Disney film.  In this film the viewer feels for the characters.  I was standing anxiously awaiting for Eric to finally pucker up and kiss Ariel in the magical boat ride scene.  In the final scene when Ariel is wed to Eric and she whispers to her father, &quot;I love you, daddy&quot; melted my heart.  The songs are fantastic.  &quot;Under the Sea&quot; and &quot;Kiss the Girl&quot; won major awards but don't forget Ariel's song performed by the lovely Jodi Benson &quot;Part of Your World.&quot;  The bottomline is that the movie entertains like no other.  The Little Mermaid should not be considered the standard of Disney movies but the pinnacle.  I have yet to see another film by Disney that moved in me the same way as The Little Mermaid.	5.0	Not the standard, but the best	2002-12-11	2	2	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	AMP7TQRWAIE84	"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D"""	"The only thing that I don't like about these Disney DVDs is that they're all SO expensive!!!Some new DVDs are 15 bucks, but the Disney ones are always 19 bucks +. I don't understand it. Can't a kid buy a Disney DVD for 15 or so bucks anymore? Guess that answer is NO.Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" mostly takes place in the sea.Ariel, who is 16, is very stubborn and headstrong, and disobeys her Father, King Triton at every opportunity.She's lovely though; smart, curious and representing for the pretty, red-heads. :PShe meets the dashingly handsome prince, Eric, and falls head over heels. She even makes a ""fatal"" deal to give up her sweet, uplifting and downright beautiful voice to the treacherous Witch of the Seas, Ursula. But that in turn, gives her a chance to love a human...But was it worth it?Once she gets legs the story seems to lag (just a bit) but one of the highlights was how excited she was to see Eric's world she's been dreaming of for a while. She gets to command a horse and carriage, gets the wear a dress for the first time and embarrasses herself many times. For some, this part will be a true highlight.The movie is more or less enjoyable from start to finish.I'd recommend any kid to watch this unless they have a short attention span.Not as good as The Lion King or Shrek, but better than Pocahontas, Toy Story and Ice Age.4.5 stars.End note: Part Of Your World is a breath-taking experience and alone boosts the score considerably.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1ETMNKF9HO2TJ	ahw	First off, I'd like to thank the makers of this movie for the indelible impact it had on the floozy ladies of my generation.  Surely I would not have had as much &#34;success&#34; as I had in college if it weren't for this movie, which taught its young, impressionable audience that, to get a man, all you need to do is sit on a rock looking hot (read: anorexic) in your bikini.  Oh, and when you find your man, you WORK and sacrifice for him, going as far as permanent transfiguration (sacrificing your voice + changing your body) to chase down your man.  Asking your man to change (i.e., change from human to mer-man)?  Not even a consideration in the movie!  LOVE IT.  Also, if you have to, disobey your parents and run away from home if that's what it takes to be with your man.That was all fine and dandy back in the day, but now that I'm raising my own little girl: honey, stay the *@#$ away from this movie.  Also, if daddy tells you to do something, you'd better damn well do it because there's no magical fairy tale ending to your F*!# ups in real life.	3.0	Thanks Disney!	2014-05-07	5	0	5

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	AV1R199BSRBL6	"A. Knepper ""StAr_review"""	"Before Disney started releasing absurd movies that justifiably performed poorly at the box office such as ""Brother Bear"" and ""Home on the Range,"" and the ridiculous ""Teacher's Pet,"" which couldn't even hit $10 million, they stuck to what they were best at -- taking classic children's stories and making them into grand animated movie musicals. People speak with their wallets, and the animated musicals mostly hit $150 million and above. Now, with the era of computer animation hitting it's peak, mediocrity (compared to films such as The Little Mermaid) such as the vastly overrated ""Finding Nemo"" and ""The Incredibles"" flourishes.But we can be nostalgic, right?My parents brought me to and then bought me all of these classic Disney movie musicals. My first Disney movie in theaters was ""Aladdin"" in 1993, when I was three years old. My first on video was this, The Little Mermaid, which my mom had bought previously. I've still watched it multiple times every year since I've had it. And it will weather the test of time far more than movies like ""Finding Nemo.""The musical numbers are superb. ""Kiss the Girl"" and ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" are probably the best of them (Sorry, ""Under the Sea"" purists, it's just not workin' for me here!), for they have the most theatrical feel. The wickedness oozes out of Ursula, who is easily the most sinister of any Disney villain, during the latter. The former is Sebastian, Ariel the Mermaid's little crustacion sidekick, rallying the sea creatures to push Ariel and Prince Eric to kiss, for only if they kiss in three days can Ariel regain her voice she gave up through her pact with Ursula to become human. It's almost good enough to be called, dare I say, intense?The tweaks to the story are top-notch. It flows perfectly enough without any confusion for the little ones and with enough emotion for the older crowd. The voices serve each character perfectly and the length is perfect for a quick movie (around an hour and a half). Of course, though, the highlight of the movie is the fabulous music.So before Disney resorted to fart jokes, they had films such as this. Parents, if your kids were born past 1995, they almost certainly are missing out on the musicals of Disney's golden age, 1988-1994, where they cranked out classic after classic. Who am I to talk? I'm a fifteen year old guy who loves great movies of all kinds, and Disney's old movies are certainly that.- 3/5/05"	5.0	One of Disney's Greatest Achievements	2005-03-04	10	8	2

We often wondered how Ursula ended up a sea witch (some others calling the multi-tentacled terror an ""octopus""); one of our favorite deleted scenes reveals Ursula's real identity . . . unless you've been basking in a seaweed wrap all these years, Ursula is voiced by the Cape's own Pat Carroll.

IT DOESN'T WORK FOR ANYTHING ELSE. Also, if you tried to watch it on your computer, it SUCKS!!! I said this because the quality is horrible and watching on 4g with full bars on my NEW SAMSUNG S4 phone or TOSHIBA laptop that does play HD movies and it still doesn't get better. Furthermore, it times out when I'm trying to watch it; then I have to wait for it to sync and process through in order to watch it. Oh, after it process through it times out again. SO, LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO RATE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH. ALTHOUGH, I LOVE THE MOVIE THE LITTLE MERMAID I definitely give that 5 to 10 stars, because I grew up on this movie. I DON'T WANT TO PURCHASE A KINDLE FIRE IN ORDER FOR NIECE OR NEPHEW TO WATCH A MOVIE JUST SO I CAN DOWNLOAD IT.AMAZON SO OF US ARE BROKE, Did you forget that Americans in a recession and that we have a government shutdown. You guys should make the video downloadable since people purchase it just like apple. You can hired IT specialist like me that actually know how to lock a movie that you can't share out to other. It calls using the account id and password in order to play the movie. For you guys to be tech savvy, you are really DUMB! Trying to watch it on a computer using wireless or dial up or anything is horrible. I hated it so much, I'm tempted to not buy anything that has to deal with movies from your company anymore unless it a dvd. Because you guys SUCKS when it comes to downloadable or instant watch!This is my opinion but I will tell it like it is.	1.0	What the world, Amazon?!!!	2013-10-13	12	1	11

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1WZ15MXASDZQB	Andrea Gustavsson	"This is my all time favorite Disney movie, I loved this movie so much I used to watch it all the time when I was little.What I like about this movie is that it has a good pace, it tells a long story in a short amount of time, by skipping out on things that probably would have made more sense, but would have slowed the movie down.One might think ""What does Eric and Ariel see in each other? They just fall in love and live happily ever after?""I can imagine of utterly boring this movie would have been, having you forced to see those characters explain and show how much they love each other.Instead, it's love at first sight, you kind of guess Eric's personality (though it's obvious he's kind and brave), and it dosen't slow the movie down, and they do add the romantic scene ""Kiss the girl"" to really show Eric and Ariels love for each other. ""Kiss the girl"" is so beautifully animated, it's one of my favorite scenes in the movie.The music and the songs really stands out in this movie, I used to sing-a-long with ""Under the sea"" when I watched it, nowadays I always choose ""Part of your world"" when I sing. That song is so dreamy, so perfect and tells the story that just because you got a lot of fancy stuff dosen't mean you are happy. ""Kiss the girl"" is also a very good song, it suits perfectly with the beautiful scene.And to not make this a sappy love-story (like Pocahontas), there is some scary stuff in this movie. The ending battle is without a doubt the best painted parts of the movie, I can't even imagine how many hours was spent drawing that scene!It's a good story, great songs, loveable (and not lovable Ursula) characters and beautiful animation."	5.0	My favorite Disney movie!	2007-07-12	1	1	0

I hadn't seen &#34;The Little Mermaid&#34; in over a decade, but while listening to Disney music on Spotify, I was enchanted by Ariel's beautiful song of longing, &#34;Part of Your World&#34;. Intrigued, I bought the movie online and watched it to see if it held up to how I liked it compared to viewings long-past.I'm pleased to see that my expectations were far surpassed.The story is interesting (even if it deviates from Hans Christian Anderson's original, tragic fairy tale), the characters are fun (Ariel is by far one of my favorite Disney protagonists), the songs are wonderful (who hasn't enjoyed &#34;Under the Sea&#34; or &#34;Kiss the Girl&#34; every once in a while), and the animation is beautiful (the undersea beauty here, in 2-D, is just as breathtaking and wonderful as the beauty of the ice constructs in last year's CGI Disney film, &#34;Frozen&#34;).Everything about this film is fantastic and memorable. This movie is now one of my personal favorites, and I hope that both kids and adults will enjoy the treasure that is Disney's &#34;The Little Mermaid&#34;.	5.0	One of Disney's Greatest Classics	2014-01-14	0	0	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	I had never seen `The Little Mermaid' growing up, but after finding out my soon-to-be child is indeed a girl my wife insisted her first cartoon be `The Little Mermaid' and so I can now say that I saw and I understand why every little girl needs this movie.  I personally don't feel it should be her first cartoon, and I'll state my reasons for feeling that way in a minute, but I do feel she'll love this cartoon as she gets older and I'm sure I'll be seeing quite a bit of it.  It is truly magical, from the animation to the storyline to the infectious musical numbers that even I as a kid knew word for word, and I hadn't ever seen the film.  You can't help but smile when watching Sebastian the crab sing `Kiss the Girl' or the upbeat `Under the Sea'.  Maybe the only cartoon that comes close to the magic of Disney to me anyways would be `Beauty and the Beast'.The story of young Ariel is one of love, but surprisingly it's neither the love you'd expect nor the love they try and push to the forefront of the picture.  The reason I love this cartoon is that it really establishes the love between a father and her daughter, which in my case is going to be very appropriate.  Here we have the overly protective father who loves his daughter more than life itself but doesn't really know how to show it.  Then you have the said daughter who rebels because she feels her father is holding her back.  In a sense her father is holding her back, but not because he wants her to miss out but purely because he wants her to stay with him always.  This is jeopardized by the evil sea witch Ursula (the main reason I won't want my daughter to watch this right away) who wants control of the sea.  She uses Ariel, offering her a bargain she can't refuse and thus starts her journey into the arms of the man she loves, Prince Eric.Ursula offers Ariel the opportunity to walk as the humans do in order for her to meet her Prince, but she must give in exchange her magnificent voice.  She only has a few days to win the kiss of love from Prince Eric or she'll become a slave.  So, with the help of her beloved Flounder and her bodyguard of sorts Sebastian she sets off to capture Eric's heart.  The cartoon is classic Disney at its finest, magical and moving, but due to a few mature areas I don't know if it's best suited for extremely young children.  The ending is quite traumatic and extremely unsettling to little kids.  I found it a bit rough myself and I'm far from a child.  Ursula is a very evil bad guy and a very dark and scary one at that.  Every child is different but if your child is prone to nightmares this may not be one to watch right off the bat.  Once she can differentiate from fiction and reality then this cartoon will become one she'll watch again and again, for there is a fairytale ending, but you have to get to it.	5.0	A classic every little girl will love...	2007-08-01	3	2	1

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3QNER0M9CJ22N	"Anna Robb ""SaraShaw"""	I never saw this movie before recently. I guess somehow I knew it was not going to be as good as they made it out to be. I remember the praise lavished on it when it came out and remember how it started the oscar talk for animated movies. But it is not really that good.  First, to me the movie is too long. Several sequences that feel like padding and are frankly boring. While at the same time I feel like I know nothing about the two main characters. Why is Ariel so obsessed with humans? Who is Prince Eric? Prince of what? Why is he sailing around on this massive ship?But then we really get into it. Eric sees Ariel and is in love with her for her voice. Um ok... later... Ursula takes her voice so Ariel must make him fall in love with her without her voice. When asked how she is to do that.. Ursula goes on to talk about how talking is overrated and men don't like that anyway. Right...  While I know that is true.. do we have to say that explicitly? In the end Eric doesn't really fall in love with Ariel as much as he was obsessed with the voice he heard. He has no idea who she is at all.Compare this to a movie like Tangled where the main characters have fully fleshed out stories and motivations.	3.0	I know... I know...

Upon receipt of the DVD, I saw that the cover was in dull colors, obviously a very bad reproduction from a foreign country. I know that Disney would never allow such poor quality printing of even just the DVD cover out of their quality control. As this movie is obviously not in release now from Disney, it is too bad that their controls force the market to be contaminated with bad product such as this copy.

In my opinion, this is the best animated disney film of all time. I mean, I'm a boy, and it's one of my favorites. It's that good! (I also love ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" ) I was ecstatic when I found out they were releasing this as 2-Disc special edition.This film is filled with beautiful design, an amazing score, an adventerous story, and an absolutley fantastic cast (Who doesn't love Jodi Benson because of this film?) Something that so many animated films are lacking nowadays.As all the Disney Special Edition DVD's, I'm sure this will have hours of bonus features, and ""making of"" featurettes.The Bonus feature that I am hoping for most (I'm sure a lot of people will agree with me on this) is recording studio footage of Jodi Benson singing ""Part Of Your World"", as they did on the Aladdin Special edition with ""A Whole New World""I'm guessing Disney purposally made this a 2006 release so that it would also be the 15th anniversary of the film.So while I know it may be hard to wait for this release, lets be happy that Disney is finally giving it's greatest film the treatment it deserves."	5.0	Finally!	2006-05-03	13	7	6

I love Ariel and Flounder so much. I love Ariel's sisters although we couldn't see them in the movie.What impressed me most was the music of this movie. ""Part of Your World"" was and will always be the classic to every Little Mermaid fan. I feel so good while listening to Ariel's voice. Because of Ariel, I knew Jodi Benson, who has my favourite voice! ""Under the Sea"" was not the best in my opinion, but it's still so classic and wonderful.I hope that it will be many bonus features in this 2-Disc Special Edition DVD. For example, interview of Jodi Benson and Samuel E.

At the same time, we were struck by how modern computer-generated animation has so leap-frogged the earlier hand-animated graphics that we found ourselves seeing the contrast throughout the movie.  Still, well worth owning and viewing, especially for young kiddos and grandchildren who are not familiar with the story.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1T9PJBFBFKSGD	Auburn Niewiadomski	"I have always stayed away from Disney princess movies, and a major reason is because I worried about being teased. So I finally decided to watch the Little Mermaid last year, and I enjoyed it immensely. Through the next week I had watched it four times when I started to realize this is one of my favorite movies. If you shy away from Disney movies, I would still recommend this one, while yet this is your typical Disney love story, it's still a great movie. I first noticed how amazing the animation was in the Little Mermaid, the animation was a big improvement over most of the movies Disney made in the 70's and 80's. The waves during the final scene are incredible for being animated and all those hand drawn bubbles in the underwater scenes must have taken forever to master. The Little Mermaid also has one of the best scores for a Disney movie and the credit goes to the talented Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. And while yet I was embarrassed to admit liking the Little Mermaid, isn't this what makes a movie great, fun characters, great animation, an incredible score and an enjoyable plot. So I will admit, while yet I may be too old to be watching a Disney princess movie I don't care.If you own the Little Mermaid on VHS from the ""Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection"", I would recommend keeping it. Jodi Benson (the voice of Ariel) introduces the trailers for the upcoming projects Walt Disney studios are working on and if you're a Little Mermaid completes' this tape is a nice item to keep. There also is a ""Part of Your World"" music video with Jodi Benson during the end credits, which I don't believe is included with the two disc special edition.I unfortunately love this movie now and I'm going to have to explain this to other people but it's a price I have to pay. A great movie should be intended for all audiences so I would recommend watching the Little Mermaid."	5.0	The Little Mermaid	2010-07-24	1	1	0

There are very minor differences with the original version that most might not notice, but among the ones that I do remember, the intro credits are slightly different and an out of sequence scene at the end of ""Part of Your World"" (uncertain if this will be corrected for the US release, but I'm assuming all discs have been mastered, printed and ready to be shipped).  And while I feel that the Lion King (even Beauty and the Beast) were better remasters in terms of picture quality, The Little Mermaid is one of my favorite movies of all time, let alone Disney classics and cannot wait to see how the 3D version of the film holds up.The extras are plentiful, which contains a lecture from Howard Ashman (producer), a short storyboard of a deleted scene starring Harold the Merman, an interview with Jodi Benson (the voice of Ariel), a featurette about how live action reference was utilized for the film, as well as a few others and also contains extras from the dvd (I didn't bother watching the Carly Rae Jepsen version of ""Part of Your World"" even though I'm a sucker for ""Call Me Maybe"" :p).This is a great movie to pick up as most children nowadays know of The Little Mermaid, but often don't get the chance to see the movie because of the scarcity (limited release because of the Disney Vault) and now is their chance to enjoy this classic as we did when we were little ones."	5.0	A timeless classic that the whole family can enjoy in HD	2013-09-10	3	3	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2KCMKZB2QO0P5	AVJ	Purchased this in part for the 3D version but the other main reason I bought it was because I thought it included the soundtrack. It says &#34;+ Music&#34; which I found out was just 7 songs from the movie and 3 renditions not in the movie. I had a difficult time trying to get my digital copy via iTunes so I could at least get those 7 songs on my iPod and it did not work out. The instructions were not very clear on whether or not the music came with the digital copy of the movie or if they were 2 separate downloads. I tried to email the address they gave for digital copy help and my email was returned to me saying the recipient did not exist! As of now I have no digital copy of the movie and no songs :(  Not too pleased with the purchase.	3.0	Not A Great Purchase	2013-10-07	3	3	0

One thing I noticed about the early theatre version of the little mermaid versus the later version was that changed the scenes at the beginning and at the end a little bit.  Doesn't make a whole lot of difference, but I actually preferred the original.  I guess some might prefer the ""edited"" version.  I'll just have to see which version(s) they put on here.One of my favorite movies, along with a clockwork orange (although that movie is definately not for kids)."	5.0	More than meets the eye	2007-01-29	2	1	1
0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A10EH95EUDO9W3	"Banshee ""Beeyotch"""	Here is the 2nd edition of Disney's most popular movie ever to come out at the very end of the 20th century. Here you will be swimming into the most wondrous underwater fantasy where a spoiled young mermaid princess breaks  all the rules to go exploring the endless curiosities of human life. Thus  she encounters and becomes quite infatuated with the dashing young prince,  so she would stop at nothing to be near him even at the great risk of her  father's eye-flashing wrath and even her own life itself. So pouting, she  runs away to exchange her pretty voice for the painfully drastic  transformation into a two-legged human being by a very greedy sea hag. Even  when she gets her impulsive wish granted by being adopted into the prince's  family, she still doesn't do her &quot;homework&quot; just as the wicked  old witch commanded her to. Instead, she would gaze dreamily at the prince  who seems to be forever at a distance. So ... it's her little sea buddies  to the rescue! Though our sweet young Ariel heroine may seem like such a  self-centered airhead at times, she's got plenty of such beauty and  charisma to whisk her all the way to a happy, happy ending! One thing,  however - the unlikely couple could've learned some sign language in the  first place.	5.0	Such a pretty, dewy-eyed fairy tale all about a fish girl!	2000-02-24	3	2	1

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A15G10OIBF5LLV	Brad Perdiew	After enjoying so many other Disney movies like Poppins, Lion King, Nemo & Frozen a few dozen times with my 2 yr old I thought I'd expand our library. .. but mermaid doesn't fit an so many ways.Most shocking to me was the actual animation. The quality of the animation is no where near that of lion king and I believe the animated parts of Poppins... a 50 yr old movie are as good as Mermaid. On our nice new TV Mermaid is the worst looking Disney movie we have.Then there's the story... which, well seems less than uplifting for a little girl. Maybe I'm crazy but it seems to be a buffet of helpless girl stereotypes that leave me believing my girl shouldn't watch it until she's old enough for us to talk about how bad it is. This movie's sensibilities seem to be straight out of the 30's.Some of the songs are fun though.	3.0	After enjoying so many other Disney movies like Poppins, Lion King	2014-07-09	1	0	1
0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2SE82MVHCBNHC	Brandi Lester	I got this digital copy of the little mermaid because i had bought the dvd. It came with a code that I understood to include a digital copy of the movie.  When asked which company I wanted to use to get the digital copy of the movie, I naturally choose Amazon.  Then my account got charged 14.99 and I was not happy. My daughter loves the movie.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A141HP4LYPWMSR	Brian E. Erland	Released in '89 `The Little Mermaid' marked Disney's triumphant return to the big screen. It had been thirty long years since the release of `Sleeping Beauty' (59) and a new generation of children were starving for a little modern Disney magic to call their own. Boy did they deliver! Who could've guessed at the time that `The Little Mermaid' was just a foretaste of what was to follow in the 90's.In my estimation `The Little Mermaid' is Disney at its very best; storyline, animation and character development are all done to perfection. Add to that Ariel, the most adorable heroine ever, Ursula, the evilest villainess to date and a soundtrack of songs you'll be humming for months and you have a classic on your hands. Definitely 5 Stars!	5.0	"""Kiss The Girl"" ~ The Best From The Disney Vault"	2007-04-06	2	2	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3GQGQIWL9IU1C	Bri	This review is for the three-disc Diamond Edition released in 2013, specifically the 3D disc. First off, very few movies are released in anaglyph anymore. Expect to need a 3D equiped TV and BluRay player.As you would expect with most 2D to 3D conversion, the 3D effect is essentially the equivelant of a pop-up book. There are layers of flat animation. It fits the style of this animated movie rather well, so it's not a complaint. There are a few in-your-face moments that become a bit surprising, such as certain scenes with Ursula with various layers of tenticles, but most of the 3D is subtle, and thusly, kind to the eyes. The 3D ends up complimenting the movie rather than competing for attention. It does what 3D does best, it draws some depth to certain details that you would otherwise miss and makes dramatic scenes more dramatic.The color was vibrant, and it appears that there was some restoriation and correction to certain scenes to remove contraversial elements. It was a delight to revisit this disney favorite in a way that made it feel new - not quite like seeing it for the first time, but fresher and more energetic.	4.0	Overall impressions of the 2D to 3D transfer	2013-12-12	2	2	0

You bring a movie from ""the vault"" and rerelease it to dvd.  Though I am happy that it has extra fetures this time around but I am really waiting for an HD version of the Disney classics. I'm kinda done with DVD (though for right now, I'm in the minority) and I want to move on to the HD era.I'll get this set for sure but only because I have no idea when you'll rerelease these films on HD. I know you already have them sitting and waiting. Heck I just saw ""Lady and the tramp"" on ABC last month in HD.Just gimmie an HD Aladdin and Litlle mermaid and  Mulan (along with so many other classic films  *Flight of the navigator*) in 5.1 or better surround sound and lots of extra features also in HD and at a great price * 20 dollars* and I'll be very happy.Really , I don't ask for much.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	ABH4G7TVI6G2T	Byron Kolln	"THE LITTLE MERMAID signalled a new renaissance for the Disney animation department.  Following the lean years of ""The Black Cauldron"" and ""The Great Mouse Detective"", the animation department was within a heartbeat of ringing it's death-knell, when in 1989  a little mermaid swam into cinemas and into the hearts of a generation of moviegoers.Based on the bittersweet Hans Christian Andersen fairytale, the story of  mermaid Ariel (voiced by Jodi Benson) and her quest to become a human and marry Prince Eric (Christopher Daniel Barnes) marked the return of the classic Disney fairytale musical.  It had been over 30 years since ""Sleeping Beauty"", and audiences completely ate it up.  I can happily say that I was there when Ariel first burst onto movie screens during the original theatrical release (so this film, along with ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Aladdin"", holds a very special place in my childhood).With a score by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken (""Little Shop of Horrors""), the musical numbers of THE LITTLE MERMAID include the Oscar-winning ""Under the Sea"", ""Part of Your World"", ""Kiss the Girl"" and ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"".THE LITTLE MERMAID had previously been available as a limited-edition DVD way back when the DVD format was still in it's infancy (so a lot of people never got around to buying it).  This brand-new double disc Platinum Edition is a must-own purchase for all fans of the film, with a wide array of bonus features:* Disney Fastplay (allowing the movie and select bonus features to play automatically without the need for a remote control - great for little kids!)* Audio commentary w/ the filmmakers* Brand new 5.1 Disney Enhanced Home Theatre sound mix* ""Kiss the Girl"" music video with Ashley Tisdale (""High School Musical"")* DisneyPedia segments* ""Treasures Untold"" Making-Of documentary* ""The Little Match Girl"" (brand new animated featurette, based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale with a music score adapted from Borodin themes; originally intended for ""Fantasia 2000"")* ""The Story Behind the Story"" (compares the original Andersen fairytale with the Disney film, and the proposed 1940 animated Disney film w/ storyboard drawings by Kay Neilsen)* ""Storm Warning"" (a look at the special animated effects team)* Deleted scenes, storyboard-to-film comparisons* ""Under the Sea Adventure"" (a virtual ride, recreating an attraction that was originally intended for Disneyland)* ""The Little Mermaid III"" (sneak-peek at the upcoming straight-to-video sequel)"	5.0	Ariel is back where she belongs...	2006-10-15	4	3	1

I am happy to have it considering what some sellers are charging and it looks like we may not see it on DVD again for a few years. This is by far one of Disney's best movies. I buy just about all of their movies including the older family movies like Swiss Family Robinson. I would have to say this rates in the top three of their musical animated movies. The whole family should like it. I'm sure girls/women might enjoy it the most since Ariel is a very independent lady.	5.0	One of the BEST	2004-04-03	0	0	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A23HKA3FZRSUL1	"Cat P. ""tomgirl"""	This is a classic Disney twist on a tale penned with a less than happy ending.  It's for kids, so of course Disney is going to change the end to be happy.  As far as Ariel not being a 'strong' role model, I can see some people's point, but I think it takes a lot to break out of your family's expextations and go after what you really want.  Yes, she falls in love with a prince (of course), but remember that she is a princess even before she marries Eric.  Also, the much-lauded character of Mulan is based on a Chinese ballad, and in the movie, is a caricature.  Yes, she kicks [...], and proves everyone wrong, showing that women really are strong and can stand up to the test as much as men can.  Fantastic.  It's too bad that such a big deal is made of it, really, because if it were a normal occurance, no one would remark.  If the movie showed that women in general are strong, rather than making a point of this one woman, it would be much more effective for the point that some people try to make with the movie.  Note her mother, who seems to stay at home worrying; also see how she is repressed when revealed as a woman, and left for dead.  Well, that's great.  Show that you are strong, and we'll leave you to prove it.  Hope everything turns out all right, bye.My point is that no story is perfect, and every story can be seen as 'bad' or 'good' from different angles.  If you are concerned about what your children get out of such movies, then talk to them.  That will teach them far more about life than any movie ever will.  As for the Disney movies, they are stories.  Teach your children right and wrong, fact and fiction, and life will go on.  The Little Mermaid is a favorite of mine, and I highly recommend it as a feel good movie.  Mulan, too, in fact.	4.0	A classic	2008-04-03	1	0	1

I placed it into my Blu-ray player (which also plays DVDs of course) and just when the menu pops up, it completely shuts down and turns off my player.  Every single DVD and Blu-ray that I have owned or rented through Netflix or Redbox have worked in my player, so this leads me to believe this is a damaged copy.I requested a return label so I can get a new copy sent out.  After multiple attempts to contact the seller, there was not a single peep/response about the ""damaged item"".  In my honest opinion, this is an extremely bad business person and everyone should BEWARE when buying from them.By the way, this is a classic movie and we have seen it many times in the past.  I was updating my collection so that my 2 1/2 year old daughter could experience this movie but of course, she is not able to experience it on the big screen.

Watching it in 3D was like experiencing it for the first time. It's something you really have to see, words don't do it justice. Not to mention, this release features some new great special features that give you insight into how the film was animated by studying actors who acted out the whole movie on a small set. There's also a beautiful piece about the lyricist who I feel is responsible for the Disney renaissance, it brings a tear to the eye.	5.0	Amazing 3D Conversion!	2013-10-29	2	2	0

I love having it on DVD and the bonus features are extensive. I would normally rate this 5 stars, but I was a bit disappointed with the cover art. I'm a fan of hand-drawn animation. The cover is very obviously a computer generated version of characters. I wish the cover art matched the animation of the movie. Ariel just doesn't look right.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3H3RHSUWQK5J6	"Cinemabon ""film buff"""	Alan Menken came onto the Disney scene with an incredible view of animated movies - why not make them as musicals? Over the next two decades, he took - not only the film world by storm - but he shook up the Broadway musical world as well. Whether you like Menken's style or not, he and Andrew Lloyd Webber are probably responsible for saving the genre and revitalizing the world of the musical. &#34;Mermaid&#34; is full of catchy tunes, the story is fun, and there is nothing here that doesn't entertain on so many levels. A great cast, beautifully executed animation, and those clever Howard Ashman lyrics make &#34;Little Mermaid&#34; a classic tale that will delight audiences for many decades to come.	5.0	The first and in some ways the best	2014-01-09	0	0	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3CI7HZ7EOXPNR	Claudia	The Little Mermaid has to be one of the best movies of all time! Disney has alot of great movies, but this one has to be one of my favorite ones. Ariel, plays such a happy, and outgoing character, with all her adventures, and things she wants to learn. She is tired of being &quot;under the sea&quot;, and she wants to know whats really up there. The music in this movie is the best! The songs in this movie, are so magical that it wants you to sing along. I think this movie is romantic, because I cried at the end of the movie, and it touched me. I dont know why, but I always cry at the end when she says &quot;I love you daddy&quot; to her dad. Well, anyways, Flounder, and Sebastian are great characters, and the scenes under the sea are really well illustrated. SO if you dont have this movie already, please, but it now, because whenever your feeling down, or feel like singing, The Little Mermaid is the movie to watch.	5.0	An amazing movie!	2003-09-12	5	4	1

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"The 80's were particularly bad for Disney. After sailing to the massive heights of Cinderella, Bambi, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, Disney was now making films such as Black Cauldron, Oliver & Company and Great Mouse Detective which didn't do the greatest of business. So Little Mermaid comes out and while box-office wise not as massive as Lion King or Aladdin, put the company back on track again. I wouldn't call it Disney's best but it's certainly highly enjoyable, surprisingly affecting and a better movie than you'd think.Taking place in the ocean's depths, Ariel is a 16 year old mermaid who's fascinated by the surface world. Her father, King Triton, forbids any contact and is especially mad when Ariel falls for a prince named Eric. Wanting to be with him, Ariel strikes a deal with sea witch Ursula: get Eric to give her true love kiss and she'll remain a human forever, or she'll belong to Ursula. With the help of friends Sebastian, Flounder and Scuttle, Ariel has to break the spell in 3 days.What's incredibly surprising about Little Mermaid is that there's very little pacing problems. Unlike let's say, Hercules or Hunchback of Notre Dame which, while good, had a couple slow parts, there's rarely a scene that just feels long. If it's not the story that's catching you, it's a catchy song and the movie's full of them. To the emotional Part of Your World to the renowned Under the Sea the film has uplifting music that even you'll get in your head. And when you have frogs singing verses on Kiss the Girl, that's charming and a great song.One thing that surprised me about the transfer was while brighter than the old releases, it didn't have that lush colorful feel like Lion King or Beauty and the Beast. Does the film have any problems? Um, well couple of the animation scenes are spotty, including backgrounds that look too painted and shifting character designs. One minute, Ariel is beautiful and stunning than she'll have this weird look to her where she looks off-kilter to other scenes. And even though he redeems himself, King Triton is arguably the worst father I've seen in a Disney film, instead of being overprotective, he comes across as almost militant-like.Since this is going back into the dreaded ""Vault"" I'd suggest getting this quick. It's a great film, not only for kids but just for casual viewing. By the way, I believe the next ones are either Peter Pan, 101 Dalmations and Jungle Book."	5.0	A great entry in Disney's catalogue	2006-10-08	9	7	2

This film relaunched Disney into mainstream movie dominance, and it is so easy to see how. Everything about this film is perfect. The voice cast, the animation, the story, and oh so importantly, the music. ""Under The Sea"" and ""Kiss The Girl"" each were nominated for Best Original Song, with ""Under the Sea"" winning the Oscar, and the film's score won Best Original Score. This film seemed a return to the glory days of Disney animation, indeed, this film was the start of an amazing run for the Disney Studios, which continued well into the 90's and early 2000's. The Sea Witch, Ursula, is one of the best villains ever thought up for a film. Sebastion, the reluctant sidekick crab, almost steals the film. Ariel, the title character, is just loveable. You find yourself pulling for her immediately. The strength of the story is such that even when Ariel loses her voice as part of her deal with Ursula, the animation captures her desperation and determination perfectly, with such exquisite nuances as a slight head turn, a lift of an eyebrow, a sigh, expresses exactly what spoken dialogue would. Hard to believe this movie is almost 20 years old! My how time flies. Fortunately, a thourough clean-up and restoration was done, with the film looking and sounding like new. Many bonus features are included, as usual for a Platinum Series release, so money spent here is well worth it. This film is a rare treat: a so-called children's film that the whole family can sit down together and enjoy.

The combination of plot, characters and music were perfect and in the end you get a movie that is timeless and music that you cannot get out of your head (can you say 'Under the Sea...').

If not, she will become the property of the sea witch herself! There's another catch, she will do it without her voice. When she agrees and is human, she finds the prince and is invited to his castle. She stays there and is this close from kissing him but the sea witch intrudes and it doesn't happen. Although the sea witch has put off the kissing, she is worried he'll still kiss her by the sunset of the third day so she disguises herself as the Prince's rescuer that he's been looking for. He falls into a trance of the sea witch and is planning to marry her on a boat cruise. But Ariel's animal friends come to the rescue and stall the wedding. Mean while Ariel is swimming her hardest to get to the wedding in time. She gets their and gets back her voice. The Prince then comes out of his trance and kisses Ariel. But it was too late. It was sunset. So the sea witch takes her back to the sea. But the prince is not giving up that easily. He fights the sea witch and finally stabs her with his boat. But there's one problem. Ariel is still a mermaid. So her father finally realizes that she is in love and turns her into a human. They have a beautiful wedding and live happily ever after. It's a wonderful film and I recommend it to everyone, young and old.	5.0	Enchanting Tale of Forbidden Romance	2003-07-02	0	0	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	AOKXMEY6M1NQ4	Dark Helmet	Finally got around to watching this last night. In this review I'm not going to bother to review the movie itself. It's seventeen years old. I'm sure if you are interested in it you've seen it by now. Rather, I'm going to review the technical quality of the film and the extras provided on the DVD. One thing that feel I should point out up front is that the movie HAS been edited, but only in one scene. The infamous 'clergyman sporting an erection' that caused such a stupid flundie flap has been photoshopped. The theatrical poster artwork is not on the cover or anywhere on the disc for a similar reason. You can find out more by going to Snopes and looking in the Disney films section. I personally don't care, but some people do. Now, on to the review.This version is widescreen, but it's 16:9 widescreen and not theatrical widescreen, but this has been the case in pretty much all the Disney movie DVDs so no surprises there. The Little Mermaid was the next to last movie Disney did using painted cels, and the film has gone through some kind of digital restoration process. There are comparison shots on the back of the DVD box that show the difference. The colors are very vibrant, and I didn't notice any problems with the encoding or animation. There is support for surround sound and audio tracks in English, French, and Spanish.It's a two disk set. Disc one has the movie, the configuration options (subtitles, commentary, language ect), a music video of the song 'Kiss the Girl' by someone I've never heard of, a bunch of previews that will be outdated in a few months, and a preview of what's on disc 2. On the box it touts something called Fast Play, which basically means when you load it in, after the standard FBI warnings and all that, the disc gives you the option of immediately starting the movie or going to the menu with the stuff I just mentioned. If you choose to start the movie directly, it plays a bunch of previews that you can skip past using chapter forward on your remote, if you go to the menu and pick play movie, it starts right away. You're actually not forced to sit through ten minutes of BS previews with no way to skip them like on some of the previous Disney DVDs. I approve.The majority of the extras are on disc 2. It's broken up into three major sections: Backstage Disney, Deleted Scenes, and Games. Backstage Disney is the largest section. It has scads of concept art (imagine Ursula as a lionfish or manta ray instead of an octopus), a videos on how the movie was made, and a new animated short, The Little Match Girl. A silent film with a musical background and is amazingly enough, actually true to the story. It's pretty well done, IMHO. Deleted scenes is just that, stuff that was cut. There really isn't much. Only three selections, and two of them are just pieces that were cut from scenes that did make it in. There's an expanded version of the opening song, a very short scene where Triton's daughters tell Sebastian that Ariel isn't at the recital before it starts, and an extra verse in Ursula's song. All of these were cut before the final animation was done, and so as you watch it switches back and forth between storyboard still shots and very rough sketchy animation. The games I didn't even bother with, because has there ever been a DVD player game that hasn't totally sucked? Didn't think so.Overall, it's going to boil down to how much you like the movie, and how much you hate minor edits. If not seeing Jessica Rabbit with no underwear for three frames bothered you, then this DVD is not for you. Otherwise, it is a comprehensive look at the movie that marked the beginning of Disney's second golden age.I give it 9 out of 10 voice containing seashells.	5.0	Good if you don't mind minor edits	2006-10-28	135	117	18

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A14E9I0FO6EVBT	dave-o	"""The Little Mermaid"" ushered in a rebirth of the animated musical which had been in a steady decline since even before Walt Disney's death in 1966. This was the film that the floundering Disney animation department had to prove themselves with... sink or swim quite literally.And the movie is a beauty! Inspired animation by greats like Ruben Aquino, Andreas Deja, and the legendary Glen Keane (who is directing the upcoming ""Rapunzel""). The effects are stunning including a riveting storm sequence comparable to the Monstro scene in ""Pinocchio"" and the final sequence with the towering Ursula as queen of the seas. Sure its formulaic now, but the musical scenes are timeless and though ""Under the Sea"" is not as sophisticated as later animated ""showstoppers"" it still makes you see why the film's first audiences described wanting to stand up and cheer after the sequence.If you're any kind of animation buff (and even if you're not), the DVD's bonus features are great. The ""Making of"" featurette is quite thorough and takes you through the whole filmmaking process from the director's initial pitch to the studio bringing in Howard Ashman who fleshed out the characters with his witty lyrics to the final tense moments leading up to the premier in 1989. There's some great suprises here including interviews with John Waters (over Ursula being modeled on drag queen legend, Divine), and ex-Disney exec Jeffrey Katzenberg who stepped away from Dreamworks long enough to bring his insight on making ""Mermaid"" (and who, we find out almost nixed Ariel's anthem ""Part of Your World"" from the film).This film is inspiring to any wanna-be animator out there. Even more so, its a great film. I only hope the current studio brass takes note that films like this are priceless unlike the uninspired sequels they've been throwing at us for the past few years.Viva la Mermaid!"	5.0	The Little Mermaid (finally) the way she was meant to be seen	2006-12-08	6	5	1

My friends also tell me this may even be pushed back 2 or 3 more weeks if it's decided by marketing that will spur more holiday purchases.I've not seen the Blu-ray yet (if I get lucky I'll get one a month or so before the official release) but am told the picture and sound are, quite simply, astounding.BTW this is my 21 year old daughters favorite movie!************UPDATE ***** UPDATE ******UPDATE ********Last week (today is 7/1/13), at the annuual Disney Products Christmas Preview in NYC, it was confirmed that the release date for The Little Mermaid Blu-Ray will be 10/1/13.******************LAST UPDATE **********LAST UPDATE**************Today I received a 'advance' copy to view.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2YIBIW1LE31SS	DCN	Disney's The Little Mermaid was a fantastic film by itself, and still maintained its grandeur on DVD.  It maintains the 1.66:1 aspect ratio and offers Dolby Digital 5.1 Audio all in crisp video and audio, respectively.  Remember, it is an 83 minute film on a dual-layer DVD, I am guessing Disney  increased the bit rate for better quality.Now, not only was the transfer  done well, making it technically satisfying, it was also aesthetic  pleasing.  For example, the label on the DVD surface itself was very nice,  and utilized a full rainbow of colours to make up a pleasant picture of  Ariel, Sebastian and Flounder.  The DVD menus were pleasing, with pictures  of various characters from the film.The DVD contains French and Spanish  language tracks which makes for a great opportunity to get children  involved in multilingualism.  I think the only major drawback to Disney's  The Little Mermaid release on DVD is the lack of extra features usually  associated with DVD's other than multiple language tracks.  I was hoping to  see a theatrical trailer, factoids, or perhaps a making-of special included  as a bonus.Although Disney's The Little Mermaid differs dramatically  from the original version written by Hans Christian Andersen, I believe it  was produced well enough to stand on its own and be its own tale.  I highly  recommend bringing this wonderful film into one's home on DVD.  Try to get  it before it goes on moratorium, 2000/02/07.	5.0	Disney's The Little Mermaid - A Superb Film and DVD	1999-12-15	0	0	0
0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2WVZGOQI3EQC2	D. C. White	This was a nice upgrade from the single disk Little Mermaid DVD I bought that was initially released by Disney back in the day when the Divx thing fizzed and Disney had to adopt DVD as the standard.I am not a big fan of rebuying my existing Library unless it is something I truly enjoy.  I am pretty sure Disney has done re-releases of Little Mermaid as DVD special editions and such but I passed on those.  However when the Blu-ray release came with 3D and all the other hype, I did decide to rebuy.  I am not sold on the 3D but I figured I would buy the current best release.The big thing I like about rebuying some of the Disney Blu-ray releases is the &#34;remastering&#34; and &#34;upconverting&#34; they do for Blu-ray.  As much as the picture has been cleaned up for 1080p, I think the audio upconversion is the big win here.  If you have a decent home theater setup, the audio is noticeably fuller on a Blu-ray presentation than a DVD presentation.  Mostly, the richer audio experience as opposed to the video experience is what warrants the purchase.As far as extras, everything that appears to have been included in the DVD set is on this package.  Although, these original special features appear to have been lifted from the original DVD set with no special treatment for Blu-ray.  There is also some new features as well that were just for the Blu-ray.  Also some of the digital addons like a digital copy of the movie and some soundtrack music inclusions are nice touches.Whether you had this in your collection before or buying it for the first time, this was a nice addition/upgrade.I think Disney will be hard pressed to top this release when it is pulled out of the vault again next time.	5.0	A justified Blu-ray upgrade if you already have the DVD of this Disney classic	2013-11-02	0	0	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A11LS12ZU93SV6	"DeRosset Myers ""DeRo"""	This seems to be the highlight of Disney animation. The Little Mermaid never seems to get boring, while the others get dry (no pun intended). This animated movie spawned pretty much every type of merchendice: video games, dolls, books, panties, happy meals, ice cream, socks, etc., etc., etc.So why is this movie so good? It's not because of the subliminal message on the original cover. This is the kind of movie that puts everything together without burning the cake. The songs aren't bad either. Even if you hate Hakunamatata (or however you spell that stupid song) from The Lion King, Sebastian's Under The Sea actually has a nice rythm. Back on the subject, Ariel is the rebelious daughter of Tritan, the self-proclaimed king of the sea. Tritan becomes especially distraut when Ariel falls for a human fisherman, so Ariel seeks help from the Sea Witch, Ursula.	5.0	Gee, Grim! It's, uh, it's really somethin'!	2003-04-25	0	0	0

Also, I'm so glad Amazon STILL had this in stock; and shipped it so speedily!Although the Disney Version adds a typical ""Disneyfied Happy Ending"" to Hans Christian Anderson's original tragic and bittersweet fairy tale, there is absolutely no denying the emotional sweep of the Broadway calibre score by Alan Menchen and the late Howard Ashman; most noteably ""Part Of Your World"" and ""Under The Sea.""In addition, the voice cast, featuring Jodi Benson, Pat Carroll, and Christopher Daniel Barnes, is superb! The entire production recalls the glory days of Disney Animation, which reached a superb apex  with ""SLEEPING BEAUTY"" 30 Years earlier. Not surprisingly, ""Little Mermaid"" ushered in a new wave of Disney animated musicals-- and this at a time when Disney's Feature Animation Dept. was banished to a smaller location off the main lot and considered dead but not officially buried.""Beauty and The Beast""  received the ""Best Picture"" Oscar nomination, but I think ""Little Mermaid"" is the far superior film. The DVD extras, chronicling ""Little Mermaid's"" stormy production history, a biography of Hans Christian Anderson and the original fairy tale, and a short animated film of Anderson's  heart-breaking ""The Little Match Girl"" make this one of the very BEST titles in Disney's Platinum Edition 2 Disc Series."	4.0	"""LITTLE MERMAID"" RECALLS DISNEY'S CLASSIC GLORY DAYS & USHERS IN A NEW WAVE OF EXCELLENCE"	2008-03-23	0	0	0

It's truly a magical experience watching The Little Mermaid on DVD and both sound and picture quality is excellent. I just wish it had a good bunch of extras just like Beauty And The Beast had. (Another classic Disney movie!) I had The Little Mermaid in norwegian on video a few years ago but I played it so much it got worn out. Now I finally have it in top quality DVD format, but some scenes are a bit longer and scarier than on the norwegian video version I had. The scene towards the end where Ursula enlarges herself and creates a storm there is a bit where she shoots Ariel off a rock making her fall into the maelstrom that Ursula created with King Triton's fork. Ursula then tries to shoot Ariel but she manages to avoid being hit. Other longer scenes are Ariel and Flounder being chased by the shark in the shipwreck and Prince Eric discovering the dynamites onboard his ship just before it explodes. These small cuts were removed from the norwegian edition of the film, which I think is really stupid, cos they add that extra dramatic touch to it all. Overall, this is a fantastic movie with great animation, unforgettable characters and top class songs with ""Part Of Your World"" being my favorite, escpecially in the end where Ariel finally gets to marry Prince Eric. That whole scene just makes me cry and - don't laugh - I'm a 21 year old boy here...lol. However, I think this movie suits for people all ages, and it will always remain a true classic for years to come!"	4.0	A true Disney classic!	2003-04-01	3	1	2

It started a wave of new Disney animated films including Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and the Lion King and so on.The animation in this film is divine (not compared to the new computer generated stuff of course)  I have enjoyed this film since it first came out and love watching childrens faces when they watch the magic come alive.The basic plot is the typical Disney plot (once upon a time and happily ever after)  Ariel who is a sixteen year old sea princess wants nothing more than to live in the human world.  However her Dad King Tritan of the Mer people won't have anything to do with humans.  So she goes to Ursela the sea witch to be turned into a human.  However like anything it costs her and she has to give up her beautiful voice.  This takes ariel on a wurlwind of an adventure on land.  (I won't share what happens next, but in the end of course she gets her man and lives on the land &quot;Happily Ever After&quot;)A must see for all families	5.0	A Classic for all ages	2002-08-01	0	0	0

Pawl ""Dani"""	"You know I couldn't write reviews of almost every other film I have seen, and leave this one out!  I remember the day I saw this film for the first time, when I was about seven years old.  It was one of those films you never forget. I had the great fortune to see ""The Little Mermaid"" in the theatre (which is how it SHOULD be seen).  Not only is the animation spectacular and absolutely stunning (this was before the introduction to computer animation, that is so widely used today), but the actors providing the voices for the characters are wonderful.Ariel (voice of Jodi Benson) is a beautiful, headstrong 16 year old mermaid who wants nothing more but to live with the land dwellers and be a ""Part of their world"" (to paraphrase on of the most well known songs from the film).  Her father, King Triton  (Kenneth Mars), knows all too well the stark reality of the fish eating, two legged creatures and doesn't want his daughter to experience the pain of being an outsider, nor does he want her to put herself in harm's way.  Nothing will stop Ariel when she experiences love at first sight, after rescuing a very handsome young prince from near-fatal drowning.I won't get long winded on you, as far as plot details are concerned.  All I am going to say is this......this is a MUST SEE.  ""The Little Mermaid"" can be enjoyed by people of all generations, and will leave you with memorable tunes, a song in your heart and a smile on your lips.  *two BIG thumbs up*"	5.0	one of the best animated Disney features of all time.....	2005-12-22	7	5	2

The only knock I have about the DVD is for the extra price of being a Disney DVD, why couldn't they throw in a few extras  like so many other DVD movie releases have done - I felt that Disney got  cheap on us on that respect, that's why I gave them 4 stars, instead of 5.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	AS7MDGC3HVTP0	Dr Andy Lange	Let me preface this review with a simple statement about myself: I am hardcore.  I like bloody-death movies, and horrible stories that defy the human will to comprehend.  I like Stephen King and George Romero and Dario Argento.And I LOVE The Little Mermaid. [grin]There is a charming, innocent quality to the music of this film that breaks through even the hardest of critical hearts.  It came at the beginning of a streak of wonderful animated movies from Disney, including Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.  Sporting no super-celebrity voices or Elton John soundtrack, The Little Mermaid nonetheless created a new archetypal genre in musical film.Try this:  Stand in the middle of a crowd of people (friends or strangers, doesn't matter), and sing a few bars of 'Part Of That World'.  Invariably, you will receive applause, smiles, cheers, from everyone, excepting maybe a few teen punks who really did enjoy the performance, but are too 'cool' to admit it.  [another grin]It is a classic story.  You'll love it, your kids will love it, your boy/girlfriend will thank you for it, and you can use it as I do to prove that you're not TOO terrible a person in your cinematic tastes!	4.0	A Fun Film For Family and Friends!

The Little Mermaid marks the return of Disney's 3rd golden era. Filled with memorable songs, characters and colorful animation. This is certainly an excellent entry in their impressive film cannon, but still pales in comparison to their early classics. The film comes to Blu Ray looking spectacular with only a few minor quibbles, one being the silly alteration in the film where the animation has been changed because it was thought by some that a character's bent knees looked like a certain male body part. I found this to be absurd, but people see what they want to see and so the PC BS still runs rampant in this country. Another thing changed is that cover doesn't have the original poster art which had one of the castle peaks change because this was thought to look like a certain male body part. I've seen the original art and a good argument can be made that it could be seen that way, but I know I never noticed it until it was pointed out to me. That aside the film looks great and nether change really effects the film.The extras are good, but not all that impressive for my taste, there is still plenty here to enjoy. If you don't own the film, then the Blu Ray is the ay to go, it looks and sounds fantastic.	5.0	THE LITTLE MERMAID COMES TO BLU RAY LOOKING GREAT WITH A FEW TINY EDITS!	2013-12-29	1	1	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	AA5XZVANDXGJE	"""dvdcollector18"""	The 3rd Disney Classic added to my DVD collection, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was really a big accomplishment for Disney. Since it was their first true classic in many, many years. Even though it does not have the same feel as the one's that Walt Disney overlooked himself, it is appealing and fits well among the top Disney films of all time. I was a little disapointed at the Disc's picture quality, but the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is fine for the film. I guess this is fine for the time being, since this film was selected to be part of Disney's &quot;Platinum Editon&quot; Line, I'm sure under that banner the DVD will be an ulitmate collectable.

It's as wonderful of a movie as I remember from my childhood, with all the memorable songs.  I'm glad that I got a chance to pass this movie on to my daughter.  The colors seem brighter on the re-released version, but that may be because my tape was about 20 years old.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	AY7AE6NUNOHWK	Emily	The Little Mermaid is my all time favorite Disney movie. After the cancellation of the 3D theatrical release, naturally I was very excited that there was a 3D blu-ray edition. YOU NEED A 3D TV AND 3D BLU-RAY PLAYER OR PS3 TO WATCH THE 3D DISK!!!!!! I was not aware of this, and thought that if I had some extra Disney 3D glasses from the theater, I could watch the movie in 3D on my television. I don't regret purchasing this product; the cover art is beautiful, and the digital copy and free music downloads are nice. But I wish I had read the fine print and known that a 3D blu-ray player is different from a regular blu-ray player.	4.0	Misleading 3D!!	2013-10-02	22	1	21

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A13OOMT2EMVTH4	Eric Russo	After being slightly disappointed with the effects on the Blu-ray release of Beauty and the Beast, I was skeptical on how this movie would look in 3D.  I was happy to be proven wrong. The movie has always been a personal favorite and the effects really brought a fresh take to the film that made me feel like I was experiencing it for the first time. The underwater setting really benefits from the jump to 3D, reminding me most of Finding Nemo (one of my favorite 3D releases). The extra dimension really helped to show detail in the drawings that I had never noticed before, in the 20+ years of regular viewing and I applaud the effort that it must have taken to make the effect as seamless as it is.The HD transfer of the movie is gorgeous, and the only complaint I have is that there are several scenes that seem to be altered or changed, most notably during &#34;Part of Your World&#34;. Disney released a statement, claiming that there was an oversight during the remastering process that caused Ariel to be out of sync with the music. If you own the 2D blu-ray or DVD release, you can contact Disney for a replacment but, at present time, it doesn't appear that they are able to replace the 3D version. In all fairness, the error in question only lasts for a few seconds and shouldn't deter you from purchasing the movie; it just might be a little jarring for a moment. Aside from that minor gripe, this is still the classic movie you remember and love and it honestly has never looked better than it has on this release.	4.0	Regarding the 3D release:	2013-12-06	2	2	0

After years of being locked in the ""Vault,"" ""The Little Mermaid"" swims forth and receives the high-definition treatment it's earned for a Diamond Edition release. I know MY house is exploding with excitement. It's become almost a monthly ritual to pull out the old DVD version and watch it ever since my kids starred in a local stage play based on the movie.Mermaid Princess Ariel wants to live up above the ocean floor in the world of humans. She makes a deal with an evil sea witch named Ursula and leaves the ocean for life on dry land. When things go array in both her beloved worlds, Ariel must enlist the help of her fish friend Flounder and crab Sebastian to set things right.What can be said about ""The Little Mermaid"" that already hasn't been? I think its award nominations and wins speak for themselves. Boys and girls of all ages adore this treasure. As stated above, it's even found life as a stage play performed around the world by children's and adult theaters.Disney spares no expense giving fans the best high-definition transfer it can for ""The Little Mermaid"" Diamond Edition. The video is pristine and the colors are vibrant. The 7.1 surround sound gives the film's musical numbers and environmental noises an extra boost that literally puts you in the middle of all the action.There's over three hours of bonus material for ""The Little Mermaid"" Diamond Edition. We get a music video for ""Part of Your World"" performed by Carly Rae Jespin. Crab-E-OKE gives viewers the opportunity to sing along with their favorite songs. Audiences are also introduced to a deleted character named Harold the Merman. There's lots more behind-the-scenes features centering on music and animation as well.""The Little Mermaid"" Diamond Edition is a 2-Disc set. It includes both DVD and Blu-ray versions of the film. You can also get a 3-disc set which features the movie in 3D. Both versions come with a digital copy included.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	ADKAWXJ9CC749	FL_Nole	Usually classic love stories like this start with a pizza delivery or a plumbing repair but this one gets going with a Prince's dog finding a nude girl washed up the beach with no voice.  After the prince lets her stay in his beach front castle the fun begins.  If the Prince lived in Malibu he would be Charlie Sheen.  Not many guys will let nude girls who comb their hair with forks stay at their place.  The nude girl only has three days to get the &#34;kiss of true love&#34; or the witch will keep her voice and she will go back to being a women of the sea.  The witch turns herself into a hot brunette copy of the nude girl but uses the voice to seduce the prince.  After some weird animal scenes the witch loses the nude girls voice.  Just as it looks like she is going back to being a women of the sea, the Prince saves her and rams the witch with his massive wood stern killing her.  This movie is every mans dream.	5.0	Disney has done it again.  Everyone should watch this fairytale love story	2013-11-30	0	0	0

It sees Ariel, the youngest daughter of King Triton of the Merpeople, fall in love with a prince and catching the attention of a sea-witch who helps her become human, on tricky conditions and in exchange for Ariel's beautiful voice. I quite like the expressions Ariel has when she has no voice. It's quite nicely animated, and worth watching for Disney fans."	4.0	Mermaid Ariel	2007-04-01	4	3	1

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3JQL0WEDC3N1B	Georgette Grimsby	Wow. This movie was so good! I think the universe knows the plot, so all I can simply add is this:Ariel knew where her heart was. It belonged on the land. And she was determined not to let ANYthing prevent her from getting there! I truly love the relationship with Ariel and her father, it hits very close to home. (I'm a fanfic writer, look at my name to figure out who's daughter my fanfic's on!)I also love Ariel's sisters, especially Alana. We see more of their personalities in the Little Mermaid series, but still. And I love the singing. I can sing like Alana, and once you realize you can sing like one of Triton's daughters, well, you're honoured!In short, Ariel knew where her heart was, and how to get there! She loved her father, but he didn't understand her. While that ripped her heart in two, she did what she thought she had to. And who can forget how she saved Eric's life, when her father said &quot;one less human to worry about?!&quot;I made up my fanfiction girl, Georgette, a year ago at this time. I finally finished writing her story of how she finds where her own heart belongs a few hours ago. I celebrated my 13th birthday last year with all my friends, wishing me well because I was going to move at the end of the month (March).A year later, I cannot believe how far we've come. Ariel's heart belonged where it did, simple as that.Hoped this gave you an interesting look at it! *Goes off to her Flying Fish swim-team meet.*	5.0	My Heart Belongs Where It Does	2004-03-01	0	0	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4	Gerard D. Launay	"The merit of Walt Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" as satisfying family entertainment is addressed more than enough times in the other reviews and does not require any more elaboration.  But let's face it, the story Disney is actually telling is a far cry from the original one written by the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen. The actual story for children is very rich in symbolism and meaning and pathos.  I certainly hope that the original story is not forgotten.It is noteworthy to bring attention to the two marvelous extras on the second disk of this offering by Walt Disney. One is a breathtaking version of ""The Little Match Girl"" which is scrupulously faithful to the original story.  The second extra is titled ""The Story behind the Story"" which not only relates some of the biography of Hans Christian Andersen himself but also the genesis of the actual Disney film through its history.  As it turned out,  Walt Disney had contemplated making a more faithful version of the story in an animated film and had commissioned some absolutely marvelous artwork by Kay Nielsen - which matches the story to its very details. (This outstanding illustrator is not so well known in this country...so I hope these sketches reach a wide audience).  Both these extras are worth the price of the disk in and of itself, particularly for purists.  (And readers, of course)"	5.0	Please Check out the Extras on the Second Disk	2012-01-07	0	0	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A7Y6AVS576M03	gobirds2	Disney's 1989 animated film THE LITTLE MERMAID is a very formidable movie, surpassing the combined visual and musical artistic talents of all concerned. Character development is one of the strong points of THE LITTLE MERMAID achieved through concise dialogue, music and simplistic yet effective images. However, most effective to the success of this film are the songs that advance the story line and define the characters. That was the brilliance of lyricist Howard Ashman's contribution to THE LITTLE MERMAID. He and composer Alan Menken developed songs that in several minutes clearly define Ariel's reckless but innocent curiosity about the humans above and her yearning to discover that world. Every song in THE LITTLE MERMAID bolsters the depth of the characters, advances the plot or enhances the significance of a scene in addition to being very melodic and well written. So in THE LITTLE MERMAID we are given a substantial amount of information and entertainment in a minimum amount of time. There is not a single frame of wasted footage in this film. The combined effort is one of a splendid and effortless looking perfect creation of a classical animated Disney tale. THE LITTLE MERMAID has become a beloved film for all of us that ever grew up with it with our loved ones. It brought magic to each of us and that that magic was brought into our families and into our homes and it will remain there forever.	5.0	The Power of Music, Scripting and Dynamic Images	2006-10-03	0	0	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2UBSGFCP2QFNV	"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'"""	"Princesses have come to Disney's rescue more than once. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs took Walt Disney and his studio from short subjects into the much more prestigious world of feature films. Cinderella brought the studio back from the WWII setbacks. And The Little Mermaid re-ignited Disney animation, officially launching a second golden age.It also redefined the musical form of animated features for the first time since Snow White. That is due largely to the vision of lyricist Howard Ashman, who can be seen on the bonus features conducting one of his insightful lectures. With the spectacular music of composer Alan Menken (who made his debut as an underscore composer with this film), the results reverberated throughout the entertainment industry.Those of us who still pine for cel animation (or 2-D, which seems dismissive) have so much to savor in this film, in particular Glen Keane's animation of Ariel herself. Even though elements of earlier Disney heroines were referenced (including Alice), no previous Disney animated lady ever had the range of expression as Ariel, thanks in no small part to the live modeling done by Sherri Stoner, who you can see in the best of the numerous bonus features, ""Under the Scene: The Art of Live Action Reference."" (Fans of Animaniacs also know her writing and acting in that great show.)As to acting in The Little Mermaid, the cast is superb, from the leads like Pat Carroll as Ursula to little gems like the seahorse voiced by Will Ryan. What might be overlooked is the fact that Jodi Benson plays two roles: Ariel and her ""evil twin,"" Vanessa), both so distinctly that it's easy to think of them as two different voice actors). A little bit of trivia, too, about Sam Wright, who voices Sebastian: he was one of the featured players in the 1974 Broadway show, Over Here!, the first such show with music and lyrics by Richard and Robert Sherman (check out the cast CD, it's great).One quirky note: Is it just me, or does Prince Eric look a lot like David Seville from the '80s Saturday morning cartoon version of Alvin and the Chipmunks?If you want to have the lion's share of bonus features on DVD, keep your Platinum Edition or find a used copy.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	ACKDSX71VI5HY	"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader"""	"SPOILERS FOLLOWThe Walt Disney Company's 1989 variation of ""The Little Mermaid"" is easily one of the best modern animated films from the studio.  With the voice talents of Jodi Benson, Kenneth Mars, and Rene Auberjonois,(albeit in a small yet memorable role as a French chef named Louis), it is fantastic.It opens its story, appropriately enough, at sea.  The ubiquitous underwater sequences never feel strained or cheap, but exciting and even organic in a fanciful way.  The story's pivotal shipwreck at sea is appropriately huge and chilling.  Additionally, the songs by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken are brilliant.  Indispensable to the story, they include ""Part Of Your World,"" ""Poor Unfortunate Souls,"" and ""Under The Sea,"" which won an Academy Award for Best Song at the Oscars ceremony in 1990.The Walt Disney Company's ""The Little Mermaid"" is still great fun, executed with a creative assurance that like many of its forebears, it will be appreciated for many years."	5.0	Wonderful movie already etched in stone for Disney	2010-05-01	0	0	0

There's one song that seems to make Materialism into a Value, as if to catch the audience Madonna might have missed.  Then there's Ariel, who has to be one of the most useless animated heroines, ever.  The girl has no ambition, no drive, and no big ideas beyond collecting ocean floor bling and marrying a Man---not a mer-man, a Man, with legs.  Needless to say, Daddy---the King of the sea, and we're not talking tuna---is utterly clueless and frustrated, since she ignores everything he says (so much so it's amazing that the shark still hasn't eaten her).  Finally, Daddy-King finds out what she's up to and blows up, so the little spoiled brat runs away to the Octo-Witch and trades her soul, or something, for legs, and gets her wish.  And, fortunately for her, there still aren't any consequences because Daddy is prepared to give up all of his power AND his life, to save her.And they wonder why our kids are such brats.Or why you let your little girls watch this stuff.Oh well, you do, and you'll buy it anyway, so my revenge will be you stuck behind the TV watching this AGAIN, for the umpteenth time.Those of you with mensa kids might want to do some prepping though.  It would be really embarrassing to walk into a room where your five year olds are discussing the ramifications on world peace, stability, and the food supply, from a marriage between a land based Kingdom and a Sea-God dynasty, if all  you can say is ""Now children, it's only a movie!""."	3.0	Kids Love It.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1SDWFE0ETD2Z4	"""heyo1"""	Sigh. Ok, I'll admit I'm a guy (with no kids). So what am I doing reviewing the Little Mermaid, you say? Maybe I'm was a sucker for a pretty face - real or animated, but I really loved this film a great deal. I never would have imagined I would fall for something like this. After all, I was 18 when the film first came out, certainly not a child, and I was never a Disney animation fan (I prefer Japanese anime). So how did someone like me, mature and sophisticated beyond my years became enthralled by...THIS? After all, wasn't it just a kiddie cartoon?! I don't know...I guess there was something truly MAGICAL about this film - a certain sparkle and dazzle that Disney was never truly able capture before or after. Despite the film being a bit formulaic, it somehow flows beautifully and surprisingly well. The classic fairy tale was transformed into a more modern and hip coming-of-age story with a happy ending (of course)! The songs were among the most wonderful I have ever heard, worthy of Broadway (it WAS composed by a pair of Broadway vets after all)! The musical numbers were spectacular, varying from the deliciously witty and delightful to the poignant and emotional. The animation was a kaleidoscope of rich colors and incredibly fluid, graceful motion. The story was fast paced and hilarious! And of course, who can ever forget our wonderful heroine, Ariel - the embodiment of beauty, innocence, and childlike curiousity, who yearns for a world beyond her own. You can really feel for her as if she was flesh and blood. A wonderful film - one that I hate to admit I love. I guess I'm what you would call a closet Mermaid fan....	5.0	My Guilty Pleasure	2002-07-19	10	9	1

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	AL8IDHJPCE00K	H	Mermaid was one of Disney's last great movies.....before they started trying to spin each classic tale into a 2nd, 3rd movie....each meaningless money making machines.The Little Mermaid is the Disney version of the Hans Christian Anderson tale. Disney brings it to life with the beautiful Ariel, and a whole cast of loveable characters- Flounder, Eric, Sebastian, Flounder, Skuttle.Ariel, the youngest of many daughters is bored with life under water and want to explore life on land as a human. She see's a man aboard a boat and falls in love. His name is Eric. When a storm rages, Ariel saves Eric and leaves his ashore. He sees her and can't forget her face. Against her fathers wishes Ariel dreams of life on land. She bargains with the sea witch Ursula to turn her into a human. The price she pays is her voice. She has to make Eric fall in love with her- but she has no voice.Ursula uses Ariels voice to bring her father to her knees. In the end, she is overcome, and Triton- Ariels father is saved, and let's Ariel go- to become a human.The music is some of the most creative animated music EVER.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	ABFJYHVD8RHLE	Hillary	"I'd been looking for this video for quite awhile for my daughter,  who was anxious to see ""Ursula"" after collecting some plastic likenesses of her.I love the Disney witches, and collect them with my daughter. Ursula is one of the best villains ever created.  She's right up there with ""Maleficent"", ""The Evil Queen""/""Old Hag"" and ""Cruella DeVille"".  She is wonderfully animated, and appropriately voiced with the deep guttural tone of Pat Carroll.  Her scenes in the movie are by far, my favorite ones.  I also like Sebastian the cranky, but sweet crab who helps Ariel's Dad, King Triton, look out for his landlubber daughter.""The Little Mermaid"" is infinitely watchable  and not too scary like some Disney movies eg. 101 Dalmatians. That one in particular gave my daughter fears for months (see my review). I feel strongly, that unless indicated otherwise, a ""childrens"" G-rated movie should be happy, and this one is.If you want to get swept away by Disney, ""The Little Mermaid""  is the film to choose.  Although it is a more recent entry,  it is very  reminiscent of the high quality, and uniqueness found in their earlier filmography.  ""The Little Mermaid""  quickly gained status as a classic for this reason, and  just as quickly, it should gain a permanent spot in your film library too."	5.0	W(h)et your Appetite for Disney Here!!	2001-10-08	4	3	1

However, when I received my product (which came in on the day that it was released, as promised) I saw that a part of the plastic broke off.  I opened it to see that it was actually the hinge, so now the dvds don't stay locked on that hinge. This is not the first time one of my Disney movies has come damaged.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1WBIIZ5KF7D6H	Impetigo	I am probably one of the biggest Little Mermaid fans in the world.  I saw this movie 8 times in the theaters when it came out in 1989 and then 4 more times when it was released in 1997 (I think).  I preordered the original VHS video and picked it up the day it came out, and I watched it that day even though I had gone to the hospital due to a bad head accident that same day which resulted in unpleasant headaches for a couple days.  I clipped out the original reviews and stories on the movie from the LA Times.  I got the Sebastion Christmas tree ornament from a McDonalds Happy Meal.  I bought the Soundtrack CD, and I bought the rerelease of the VHS video, etc, etc...And now I have this DVD... which is good only in that it is digital (meaning better sound and video quality) and slightly letterboxed.  I have a big gripe about this DVD though.  First of all, there are absolutely no extra features, unless you count &quot;Region 1 Coded,&quot; &quot;interactive menus,&quot; and &quot;chapter search.&quot;  No trailers, no TV spots, no making of documentaries, no interviews, no storyboards, no audio commentary, well, you get the point.  Basically I hate this DVD even though I love this movie.  The annoying new cover also bothers me, why couldn't they use the original movie poster covers?  Perhaps it didn't appeal to the kids enough.  I still recommend getting this DVD, since a special edition may never come out or maybe not until you or I are dead.One last problem with this DVD (and for that matter, all video versions of it also), during the end credits, after &quot;Under the Sea&quot; finishes (rather fades out), the song &quot;Part of Your World&quot; plays, followed by the score.  Now, I'm pretty sure that in the theatrical release of this movie, &quot;Under the Sea&quot; is NOT followed by this song, but rather by orchestral score music.  This is kind of annoying, but I'm sure you won't mind if you bother buying this DVD at all.  My question to Disney is, when will &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;Aladdin&quot; come out (and Lion King too I guess)???  I think I hate Disney almost as much as I hate George Lucas because of their annoying DVD release policies.Above all, this movie is GREAT and you will and must cherish it forever!!	5.0	Great Movie, Bad DVD	2001-02-10	5	5	0

Of course these days I have this special edition DVD and I like it just as much now. I always loved Ariel. I think she's probably my favorite Disney heroine. I never could understand why she wanted to become human, even as I got older... after all, she barely knew Eric! Being a swimmer who adores the water, I sympathized much more with her daughter in the sequel! Well, it's a fairy tale, so I guess she has to get her prince. And of course, I was jealous of her gorgeous hair. I had that hair color for a couple months when I was 20 and in college. What an influence from a Disney movie!I think the music in this movie is superior to some other Disney movies. The animation is beautiful. (Of course, I may be prejudiced because I love the water.) And I enjoyed both sequels. They tend to be better when Disney makes them quickly instead of 40 years later.	5.0	One of my favorites!	2012-03-22	0	0	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A16YMTIJ7355F1	jag4723	"This is no doubt a beautiful and classic disney film.My advice:  Wait for the 2-disc ""Platinum Edition"" to be released.  It will contain the extra bonus features that the ""Limited Issue"" lacks.  Also, if you wait you can probably find it for about 20 dollars, which is much better than buying it second hand right now for a ridiculous price.  You will get more for your money if you wait!  Also, you should know that Disney has decided to speed up their releases with the Platinum series (from 1 every year to 2 each year).  So, Little Mermaid will be out in October of 2006.  So, if you can wait a year and a half to get the better version, I would recommend it! Especially if you're into extras and bonus features (because the limited issue has NONE!)So, if anyone is interested, Cinderella is the next Platinum DVD to come out in October of 2005, followed by Lady and the Tramp in March of 2006, and then (finally!) The Little Mermaid in October of 2006(For 2007, the March release will be The Jungle Book and then 101 Dalmations in October)For more information... UltimateDisney.com is a great website!I hope you found this advice helpful, as my wish is for everyone to be able to enjoy this gorgeous Disney film!"	5.0	A fantastic movie, but you may want to wait....	2005-04-27	132	105	27

Simply put, this is the BEST way to experience the magic of ""The Little Mermaid"" at home until the eagerly anticipated ""Platinum Edition"" DVD appears in fall 2008 -- I'd like to point out, too, that contrary to several other reviews on Amazon.com, this DVD plays great and didn't freeze on me once.However, that's where the goodness of this disc ends.The disc has no special features whatsoever.  Oh, sure, you can switch the language to Spanish or French, but there's no juice.  Not a single tidbit about the making of, no trivia game, no sing-along, nothing.  For this gem of a movie, I'dve expected more.  All the more reason to look forward to 2008's two-disc ""Platinum Edition"" reissue, which will be fully rerestored, THX certified, and bursting at the seams with bonuses.Still, if you can find it, get this DVD -- until 2008, this is the ultumate ""Little Mermaid"" home entertainment experience.***** (5/5) solely because of the supurb presentation of the film.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A29YI8SZMQICY	"James ""James"""	The Little Mermaid was Disney's saviour after a series of unsuccessful films like the Black Cauldron and Oliver. Thank god for Howard Ashman and Alan Menken bringing a style of animation to a new time high with the likes of Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin.The tale is of Ariel, the mermaid who longs to be a human. The Little Mermaid is a wonderful tale surrounded by fabulous characters like the sea witch Ursula, the loyal servant Sebastian and the trusting friend, Flounder, and encaptulated in marvalous songs like &quot;Under the Sea&quot; and &quot;Kiss the Girl.&quot;From the opening scenes of dolphins playing with a sailing ship to the colourful delights of &quot;Under the Sea,&quot; The Little Mermaid is a must for any collection.Of particular note to Australian customers, the original closing credits score on the R4 version has been replaced by trashy up beat versions of some of the more successful songs from the movie. As far as I am aware, the R1 has not suffered from the same knife and retains Menken's Academy Award winning score.	5.0	Disney's Saviour	2001-07-16	2	1	1

Luckily, this does not spoil the tale in my opinion - and we were all expecting it, anyway, weren't we?While the story is good, the music score is great.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3UV7L5ND3EH8T	"Janet Boyer ""Snowland Deck and Coffee Tarot C..."	"Until recently, I hadn't seen The Little Mermaid. My family and I went to Disneyworld for the first time in August 2006, and seeing the live Little Mermaid show--as well as the preliminary sketches for Ursula at the Disney Animation Studio--piqued our interest in this classic Disney tale.My son became smitten with Ariel and as soon as the Platinum edition came out, we bought it!The re-colored version is FANTASTIC: they show the before and after pictures and the difference is amazing. Instead of a washed out pumpkin color, Sebastian is now a vibrant red/orange crustacean!The Backstage Disney disc is especially fascinating. The writers, directors, animators, and voice actors were intereviewed for this Plantinum disc, providing some fascinating insights into what went into making The Little Mermaid.For example, I was surprised to find that Jeffrey Katzenberg was pushing for Part of Your World to be eliminated from the movie. (Honestly, can you IMAGINE this movie without that signature song?!) Apparently, the movie was screened before some youngsters and an anal little girl dropped her popcorn in the front row. She bustled around--ignoring the film--so she could pick up the popcorn.An equally anal Katzenberg took that as a sign that the song was boring and should be removed from the movie--even after the animators and others BEGGED him to keep it in. The man who did the animation for that incredible scene begged Katzenberg, too, and earned it a stay of execution. And it's a darn good thing, too!There are additional fascinating bits of information in the Backstage disc, including:*How many expected Ariel to be blonde, but because Splash with Darryl Hannah was just released they wanted to do something different. Apparently, there was quite a fight between blonde and red--but red (thankfully!) won out!*There was another full-length song written before Poor Unfortunate Soul called ""Silence is Golden"". We get to hear how the song sounds--sung by, if I'm not mistaken, composer Alan Menken!*A brand new shade of green was invented just for Ariel--called, appropriately, ""Ariel Green"".*How Jodi Benson's daughters ask her to sing Part of Your World--every other night before bedtime!I also enjoyed hearing about Hans Christian Anderson (although his bio is a sad one), from those involved with the Disney movie as well as the curator of the Anderson Museum in Odense, Denmark.There are other great extras on these 2 discs, including a video of Ashely Tisdale (High School Musical; Suite Life of Zach and Cody) singing ""Kiss the Girl"", the animated short ""The Little Match Girl"" (what a tear jerker!), a virtual adventure on a theme park ride (that was, sadly, never built) created by Disney Imagineers and much more.We have both the Plantinum version of the Little Mermaid, as well as the soundtrack, and we LOVE IT. I highly recommended this movie for both kids and adults; the colors are eye-popping, the story compelling (and much gentler than the Anderson version), and the songs SPECTACULAR. In fact, next to Beauty and the Beast, this is my favorite set of Disney movie songs.(We just got back from shopping, my son has a brand NEW DVD...but guess what he just put in once again? Yep...The Little Mermaid!)"	5.0	Excellent!	2006-10-14	5	4	1

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A20IPZQ38M96RB	J. Bakker	"Full review at Metal Arcade .NetOriginally released on November 14th, 1989, The Little Mermaid has since gained legendary status in the pantheon of great Disney animated films. Based on the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale (which is much darker than Disney's take), the film tells the tale of Ariel, daughter of King Triton, lord of the seas. Ariel is a rebellious girl, fascinated by the humans that live on land above her. She collects trinkets from the outside world, and becomes infatuated with a prince named Eric when she saves him from a brutal storm at sea. Against her father's wishes, and while dragging along her friends Flounder and Sebastian, she seeks out the devilish sea witch Ursula - who promises to give her a human form. The catch? Ursula wants her voice, and Ariel will have three days to make the prince fall in love with her - or else she'll return to her mermaid form and her soul will belong to the sea witch.Filmmakers Ron Clements and John Musker were under a lot of pressure to deliver a good film with The Little Mermaid, as it was one of the most expensive productions Disney had undertaken in the pre-computer graphics days. Luckily, a solid script, captivating songs written by Alan Menken, and brilliant artwork came together to create a cinematic masterpiece for the ages. Of course, the film went on to win stellar reviews, earned several Oscars and Golden Globes, and ended up taking in over $200 million in box office.There's no denying that The Little Mermaid looks gorgeous on Blu-ray - this is overall a great 1080p AVC HD transfer - but the film is beginning to show its age a bit. I remembered it looking better than it actually does - while there are plenty of beautiful, colorful shots under the sea and in Eric's kingdom, there's definitely a softness to the picture. It's the last of Disney's films to use actually hand-painted animation cels - save for a few shots where the pioneering CAPS digital coloring system was utilized - so this is likely why it looks a bit more dated than it is. The film was only a few years behind Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King, yet those films look superior on Blu-ray.The actual hand-drawn animation looks great, and it's obvious the lengths that Disney's animators went to to properly emulate human emotion and movement - one of the extras goes into detail about all of the live action footage that was shot for reference. But there's also plenty of animation that looks a bit choppy or perhaps unrefined, as if the film was under a time crunch. There's also a few changes made from the 2006 edition - while the colors and contrast appear to be boosted to make the image pop more, there are a few alterations in colors in some scenes, and also a few issues in the remaster, such as a random bar that appears for a split second in the climactic sea battle. Overall though, the presentation is definitely a step up from the 2006 edition.The sound mix is definitely decent, once again considering its age. The 7.1 DTS HD soundtrack comes alive during the major songs and setpieces, namely the bombastic ""Under The Sea"". That said, some of the mix feels a bit uneven - dialogue seems constrained to the center channel, while music and effects are panned all over the stereo field. The soundtrack does make an impact at times though, such as in the storm at sea where Ariel saves Eric and the final battle against Ursula.Disney has managed to cram all of the original extras from the 2006 Platinum Edition DVD onto this Diamond Edition Blu-ray, plus a host of all-new features. Here's a list of the new stuff:""Part of Your World"" Music Video Featuring Carly Rae Jepsen (HD, 3:39). You probably know this girl from that ""Call Me Maybe"" song that took over the world for a short while. This is her new version of the classic track sang by Jodi Benson, but she can't really hold a candle to the original. Still, her voice isn't bad by any means.@DisneyAnimation (HD, 10:45). This is a really cool look inside the animation studio at Disney, and has a few interviews with artists there that were inspired by seeing The Little Mermaid when they were young. A few of the older guys who actually made the film are here too, and shed some light on some interesting facts about the creation of this classic.Deleted Character - Harold the Merman (HD, 2:05) Ron Clements and John Musker talk about and show rough animation for a bespectacled, nerdy character that was ultimately removed from the final film. He had quite a minor role in the first place.Under The Scene: The Art of Live-Action Reference (HD, 13:13). This is pretty interesting. I knew that animators and artists utilize reference material, but apparently in a number of Disney films live actors were hired to essentially act out the entire movie, which was then studied and recreated in animation for a true-to-life look. There's some funny footage here, such as the actor who played Eric rowing in a serious scene while on an office chair with oars, and the girl who played Ariel diving in a giant freezing tank so that the filmmakers could capture what hair looks like underwater. Also shows some live action footage from Alice In Wonderland and Sleeping Beauty.Howard's Lecture (HD/SD, 16:27) A lecture by Howard Ashman, who was the lyricist for `The Little Mermaid'.Part of Her World: Jodi Benson's Voyage to New Fantasyland (HD, 4:45). Actress Jodi Benson, who played Ariel, taks a trip with her children to the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World to check out New Fantasyland.Crab-E-Oke Sing-Along (HD, 15:35). Songs include ""Part of Your World"", ""Under the Sea"", ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"", ""Les Poissons"", and ""Kiss the Girl"".Overall, this is another great release from Disney, and a solid package for those anticipating The Little Mermaid`s hi-def release on Blu-ray. The picture and sound are about as clean as they're ever going to get, and fans of the film get a whole hour of brand-new features on top of all of the existing DVD extras on the disk."	5.0	A Disney classic that looks better than ever on Blu-ray	2013-10-05	0	0	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1TSNHIPQR5FPA	J. Delzer	The movie is unchanged as far as story - Ariel still spots her prince, falls in love, trades voice et cetera.  I'd like to rate this only 4 and a half stars, however, because it's not a true high quality image conversion, if that makes sense.  Let me explain.Disney has been trying to convert their older, classic movies into a more digital 'look' for the younger kids who are used to seeing Pixar style graphics and clean lines.  In the latest version of the 1989 classic, they've done this.  Ariel herself looks as great as ever, and she and her friends have been cleaned up and are flawless.  However, the backgrounds are not as crisp nor as detailed.  Why?  It was the backgrounds that had all the effects applied to them - bubbles, which were hand drawn cel by cel in 1989 and even in the rerelease of 1998 were detailed and matched everything else in the film.  Now, the backgrounds aren't as 'clean' and 'flawless' as the characters.Does this detract from the film's timeless quality?  Not necessarily; I have a degree in film production and have studied the movie extensively, and I guess I have a good eye.  Most people probably won't notice the difference in digital and cel production.If Disney really wanted to, they could create a new Ariel adventure that was fully CG - almost like with TLM3 but with the sister's ages correct - or perhaps even an Avengers style film with Rapunzel, Ariel, Belle et cetera and then use the Pixar style... but I digress.This is the film from 1989 that saved the Disney movie company, but perhaps it's not quite ready to be called polished just yet.	5.0	Still the best movie, but quality issues?	2013-12-17	0	0	0

"I have found that this film has become one of our favorites, and for good reason. It has true  love (ah, true love: the best kind!), determination, drama, humor, delightfully amusing scenes (Ariel the Mermaid flirtily combing her hair with a fork at the dining table in the castle, because Scuttles the Seagull [whose voice is superbly played by Buddy Hackett] told her a fork was a ""dinglehoffer ... which humans use to straighten their hair with!""), an incredible Oscar wnning score, and a HAPPY ending. The original tale, by Hans Christian Anderson, did not end so happily...Disney was wise to change this. In so doing he made this film ""The Little Mermaid"" beloved by families all over the world.  We may watch it a bit more than most families (we have children with autism --when they have favorites they like to watch them a LOT!!!) but I don't mind a bit. This is top notch cartoon filmmaking and I love this movie as much as my children do! Sebastian the Crab, for example, is charming! The plot is totally great!

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2CEX7784M8YSU	Jeffery Bauman	Movie:  What is left to be said about &quot;The Little Mermaid?&quot;  This is the mvoie that saved the Disney animation department in 1989.  After being in a slouch in the late 70's and early 80's the Disney studio got a blessing in disguise: Universal's &quot;An American Tale&quot; became the top grossing animated film of all time up to that point. Disney had competition. They decided to make a huge turn-around and created one of the greatest animated films of all time.  &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was an immediate smash, and heralded the Disney animation rennaissance.  Not since &quot;Snow White&quot; in 1937 had there been such a good animated film.  &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; has held up incredibly well over the past 15 years, and is still a great movie.  It is my second favorite animated film ever behind &quot;Beauty And The Beast.&quot;  Ariel is one of the best heriones to come from Disney, ranking up there with Snow White, Princess Jasmine, and Belle.  I'm not even going to bother with a plot recap, as everyone has seen this movie at least once.  &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; comes to DVD in a rather lackluster release, but its enough to hold fans over until the 2-Disc Platinum Edition is released.  (5.5/5)Video:  The film is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.66:1, and is non-anamorphic.  The film has always been very grainy, so that should not be seen as a sign of inferior quality.  The picture only looks okay.  Not bad at all, but if it were a little less bland in the color department, that would have helped.  Sharpness and detail are very good, however.  (3.5/5)Audio:  There were apparently two versions of the this DVD released, or one was an extremely limited promotional copy, or something.  The DVD available here on Amazon has the wonderful Dolby Digital 5.1 remix that was done for the film's 1997 theatrical rerelease.  This is a fabulous mix.  The surrounds are put to effective use throughout, but are subtle when neccessary.  The front 3 channels are also used very well, and bass is deep and responsive.  Excellent.There also seems to be a much more limited copy floating around that also includes a Dolby 2.0 Surround track, as well as a DTS 5.1 Surround track.  This is the copy I own.  However good the Dolby Digital track is, the DTS is even better.  There is better bass response, and the mix is a little louder.  The 2.0 Surround track is how the film sounded back in 1989, and is good for purists who hate remixes.  (5/5)Extras: None, not even a trailer.  (0/5)Overall:  &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; is a fantastic movie that everyone should own.  If you just can't wait for the Platinum Edition like I couldn't, then go ahead, buy this DVD.  If you have DTS capability, try to find the version with the DTS track, which can probably be found on Ebay, where I purchased my copy.  Whichever version you choose, expect a great film either way.  But, with the Platinum Edition announced for an October 2005 release, the wait is nearly over!  I can't wait for the Platinum Edition!  Oh well, I still have the movie to tide me over.	5.0	Little Mermaid DVD Review	2004-02-13	4	3	1

For one, it's a two disc dvd but the inside of the case is unlike any other Disney 2-disc dvd case I have ever seen. My mom has this same dvd and her case is totally different. It came sealed but I think the person who sold it must have done it themselves because the Disney Magic Code for rewards points on the inside cover had already been used.

I just moved and forgot to change my address, so my stuff got delivered to the wrong place. I just considered it a stupid mistake and figured I was out $30- $40 bucks. It was my mistake, so I just accepted it and moved on. Regardless of the fact that I made that silly mistake, a few weeks later, I started receiveing the packages, one by one.each package was labeled with a change of address note. I'm well aware that part must have been either the post office or ups,but my little mermaid was never delivered for some reason. I'm just assuming that a person saw the package and took claim to it. That happens. Its life. But somehow amazon found out that I never received my packaged and had refunded me my entire purchase!The point that I'm trying to make here is that I never expected them to refund my money when it was my mistake in the first place.

It just cannot be matched - Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea tried and failed -  horribly!  Disney did a wonderful job adapting this fairytale as well, the original Hans Christian Anderson story was a bit gruesome and... it had a terrible, NOT happily-ever-after ending!  This story brings you excitement, fun, and touching scenes that are unforgettable (considering that this was made in the 1980's and I have seen this movie soooooo many times!).  This movie is guaranteed satisfactory for all ages (yes, we teens like these &quot;juvenile&quot; films too!).  Just listen to the beautiful songs, look at the nice animation, and LIVE the magic!

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	This, in my opinion, is the movie that saved Disney from fading out of existence, as we know it. Before the `Little Mermaid' there had not been a blockbuster Disney animated feature for years (specifically not since the `Great Mouse Detective') while `Oliver and Company' was released the year prior to this it was following the old formula and was not, to my knowledge, particularly successful.'The Little Mermaid' revived the breathtaking beauty of the classic Disney films like `Sleeping Beauty' and `Snow White' with it's tale of innocence pursued by evil, and true love conquering all. The animation is pretty dated compared to Tarzan or Atlantis. But that's hardly the matter. The beauty of the film is its radiance, not in its drawings and colors.I'm very happy that this finally came out on disc and able to share this with my kids instead of constantly taking this out from the library. This is perhaps one of the top 10 animated films ever made, I find it has a much deeper heart than `Beauty and the Beast,' and although it signified the beginning of a brand new Disney Empire, I find that it also signified the end of it. A film like this can be imitated but it can never be duplicated. And animation has grown into a magnificence and technologically superior story telling medium. But what the `Little Mermaid' had, it's still to be re-captured, and that's a heart as big and as deep as the ocean.`The Little Mermaid' is defiantly for the whole family and is a gem on its own right. It stands alone as one of Disney's most enchanting modern creations for a new generation. It bears repeated viewing remarkably well, and the musical score is both original and entertaining with many different styles throughout.	5.0	Arguably the most important movie Disney ever made.	2006-10-06	9	6	3

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	AJ87HID4E9Z5W	Jessica	"This Disney Classic, made in 1989 is the tale of a young mermaid, Ariel, who is at the point in her life where she is ready to become and independent woman. Her fantasy of being part of the human race explodes when she swims to the top of the sea, and sees Prince Eric, who will eventually become the love of her life. After saving Price Eric from drowning, she can not get him off of her mind. She decides that it is time for her to gain some independence, so she goes to Ursula, a sea witch. In exchange for her beautiful voice, Ariel is given the opportunity to become a human, and risk everything for Price Eric. This movie is meant for young girls, yet uses a lot of imagery in order to speak about societal issues. Women in this movie are viewed primarily as dependent upon men, until they take their own initiative. Ariel is dependent on her father for her whole life, and only tries to gain independence when she has the chance to be with the man of her dreams. In order for Ariel to win his heart, she must give something of great importance away. This in itself may give young children the message that in order for a woman to win a man's heart, she must do it without using her voice, that her looks would simply be enough. Ariel in a sense will be judged by Prince Eric, simply based on her body, exemplifying the notion that women are only viewed by men, having nothing to do with their ""voice"" or personality. Although this view of the woman is negative, in the end of the film women are looked at in a much more positive light. The idea that a man can get passed looks, and love a woman for her ""voice"" comes out at the end of the film when Eric chooses Ariel, the woman with the beautiful voice for who she really is. This makes the stereotype of an ""Independent woman"" seem possible to young girls; Ariel was able to persevere through problems that would come her way, and would use all her effort, including her ""voice"" to win a man's heart. This movie has many messages for young girls, although not positive all throughout, in the end children are given a positive view of what it means to be an independent woman who is able to accomplish her goals."	5.0	Independent Woman at a young age	2004-05-10	6	2	4
0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1Q2IJY8KPY75M	Jessica Kales	I loved this movie as a child. I did everything except worship it. I viewed it as a strong independent woman who pursued forbidden love. I watched this again recently and I see it as anything but. I see Ariel as a little girl who doesn't know what she wants but will do anything to get it. She showed a strong dependence on Prince Eric. This is not the type of message I would want to send out.

I was a junior in high school (blush) but even now as an adult and a mom, I still love this movie and that I can share it with my daughters.  It's a timeless story, with wonderful music.  My only concern is that now, as a mother, I notice the scariness of Ursula, the Sea Witch, more than I did as a non-mother.  My 6 yr old immediately decided upon seeing and hearing Ursula that she was bad, and was anxious whenever she came into a scene.  It was a little disconcerting to see her agitated like that, but with some discussion, she's fine.  If you've never seen the movie or your child has never seen it, make sure they're OK during the Ursula scenes.  And be aware that there's a literally explosive death scene near the end, where Ursula is jabbed by a boat's sharp front and she explodes into chum.  I hadn't remembered it being quite that ""graphic"" and again, had to reassure my 6 yr old that mean old Ursula wasn't going to hurt anyone again."	5.0	Wonderful Classic	2007-01-09	0	0	0

Of course, my daughter was absorbed with it, but later asked me alot of questions about Ursula and bad guys and stuff like that.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A285Y6MRU4GH9	Joecool	Disney's twisted portrayal of true love is mine too!  The artists are spot on with Aerial's measurements and writers don't miss a beat with her personality.  There's just something magical about her loving a guy before he even has to talk to her.  Aerial's fascination over the statue of a man is admirable as well, and while he's away could help keep her faithful.  Plus the fact that she cannot talk only adds to this mystical story of what real love can be.  My unique desire remains unfulfilled in real life, but lives on forever in this breathtaking fairytale.

I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter, who is a graphic designer. She thinks this is a bootleg copy, from a third-party Amazon seller. The graphics and lettering on the covers are fuzzy and indistinct, and the shrink-wrap doesn't look right. I have to agree. She didn't even open it to check the DVD itself. I don't know how Amazon can allow this kind of deception and illegal practice.I put in a claim to Amazon to return it for a refund, and after 4 business days still haven't heard from the seller. But Amazon did issue me a gift card refund under their A-to-Z Guarantee. After buying from Amazon for 11 years, this is the first problem I've had.	1.0	Beware of Bootleg Copies!	2013-12-31	1	1	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A10ODC971MDHV8	John Farr	"A triumphant return to the hand-drawn Disney classics of old, the effervescent ""Mermaid"" is a sparkling mix of superb voice acting, energetic animation, and a highly infectious songbook, all loosely based on the Hans Christian Andersen story. As voiced by Sam Wright, Sebastian the Crab is a particularly inspired entry in the studio's canon of irresistible helpmates, while Ashman and Menken songs like ""Kiss the Girl"" and the Oscar-winning ""Under the Sea"" will have you humming to the beach and back. ""Mermaid"" is a fun, intoxicating Atlantic fantasia for every size minnow in your splash-happy household."	5.0	The Little Mermaid	2007-07-10	2	2	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1COW0UIB5HA9J	"John Lindsey ""John"""	"Deep down in the oceans in the wonderous kingdom of Atlantica where the Mer-Folk live, a beautiful Mermaid princess named Ariel always dreams of living on the land with humans for she believes that they are not dangerous as her strict father says they are. One lucky night, she rescues a human prince named Eric from drowning and falls in love with him. With the help of her friends Flunder and lovable Reggae crab Sabastian, they want to help her dreams come true as they seek the sea witch Ursula who makes a deal with her to sell her voice and to make her human, but if she can get the kiss of true love then she will be human forever and if she doesn't within three days then she will become a Mermaid again and will belong to Ursula forever. She does the deal for now she is speechless (literally) and is human, she is taken in by the prince she desires and they both begin a relationship that seems magical, although Ursula is jealous as now she wants vengeance and the kingdom to herself until Ariel must stop her.One of Disney's most beloved and magical movies of all time! sure after ""Black Cauldron"" and ""Great Mouse Detective"" flopped in theaters and ""Oliver and Company"" being a minor hit in 1988, it wasn't until late 1989 when this motion picture based on Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale become a major blockbuster for the disney studios and proved to be the ultimate ray of hope. The animation is nothing sort of breathtaking considering it took 4 years to make with some early CGI and excellent voice acting by Jodi Benson (Perfectly gorgeous voice), Pat Carrol as Ursula, Rene Aubejenos as the goofy French chef, Buddy Hackett as the moronic but charming Scuttle, Ben Wright as Grimbsy, and Samuel E. Wright as the show-stopping crab Sabastian. It won two oscars and become a true milestone in disney animation for a long time thanks to the unique songs by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, a must see! Ariel is quite an animated dish and guaranteed to make any man drool.This 2-Disc special edition DVD offers quality picture and sound with excellent extras like audio commentary, behind the scenes footage, a look behind the special effects, deleted scenes, art and photo galleries, music videos, and more in this must have DVD for any animation fan."	5.0	An engaging Disney classic!	2007-09-20	2	1	1

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A10EICDA6FL5VK	Johnny B. Quick	"After Walt Disney lost his battle with lung cancer in December 1966, Walt Disney Pictures slowly went down the tubes. The 70s brought only semi-successful films, and the 80s were a very rough time for the company. In the late 80s, The Little Mermaid was conceived, ironically based on an idea of Walt Disney's dating back to the 1930s.The Little Mermaid was released to theatres in 1989, and suprisingly it did splendid! The movie quickly became one of Disney's first ""classics"" since 1967's The Jungle Book. When released to VHS in 1990, it sold an estimated 7 million copies in it's first month and became the best selling video of 1990. Today the movie remains a milestone in Disney history, and is responsible for triggering a string of successes that last to this very day.I personally think The Little Mermaid is a wonderful tale of a mermaid, Ariel, who is sick of life under the sea and wants to be human. She then makes a deal with Ursula, an underwater witch: she gives Ursula her voice in return for legs. If she can find a true love, she gets her voice back. If not, she stays voiceless forever.Everybody who loves Disney movies has to see this film. It's among Disney's best!!!"	5.0	"The Start Of The ""Disney Renaissance"""	2014-03-30	0	0	0

A day or so later, I received an email telling me my order was delivered and I was billed for both of the sets I ordered.I contacted Amazon to file a complaint, and they directed me to their customer support portal through I could contact Yeomanill directly. I emailed a complaint to them explaining the situation, and wanted them to send the second item or remove the charge for it. A week later I sent another email stressing the same request.It's been nearly a month since I received half of my order, and a week and a half since sending my second complaint.

The most impressive quality of the movie has to be the music. Over half the soundtrack of the movie is a masterpiece (most of the rest is excellent), worthy of mention in any &quot;top-100 of all time&quot; music chart. Another great thing about this movie is that it has a big heart. There was obviously an unusual amount of love placed into the drawing, the acting of the characters, the voices, the colors, the photography, and the direction.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	AG7G173LWA41M	Joseph Robert Barry	Like many I enjoyed this movie as a kid and I still think of it as a good movie. However as an advisory to those who have kids I pass along this advice. This is one of the big animated disney films based on a literary classic that takes liberty with the ending. Disney knows that its primary audience loves the happy ending. It is my feeling that had disney told the actual story of the little mermaid then this film would not have been as popular.  When the mermaid becomes human it is a literally painful experience every step that she takes hurst and feels as if she is walking on needles. The mermaid also dies at the end of the book because the one she loves falls for someone else.Now before any of you get on to me and think I'm bursting peoples enjoyment, I'm not. I enjoy this movie for what it is. Even though the ending is not the correct one I will say that disney does do a good job at keeping the overall story intact. The one thing that disney is going to take into consideration is that if it is going to do more animated movies on literary classics then they need to make sure that the ending is a happy one because that is what its audience on a regular basis expects the studio to deliver.	4.0	Good Movie for what it is	2008-03-05	2	0	2

The magical combination of the fresh and fun Ashman/Menken songs, the gracefully characterized animation of Glenn Keane, the charming vocal performances (especially of Jodi Benson as Ariel and Samuel Wright as Sebastian) and the compelling coming-of-age storytelling became the template for a decade of lucrative blockbusters.The success of ""Little Mermaid"" let its creators dare to dream big and the Best Picture-nominated ""Beauty and the Beast"" could never has existed without it.

Although the music was good, I was in fact disappointed by the picture quality. It says that Disney cleaned up the film in order to make it clearer, but it seemed just way too grainy and foggy at times. I give it only three stars for the sound quality which was great, but lost the other two because of the poor color.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A28OB1QLXN5BM6	"Karen Joan ""Siren"""	"There is no question that in 1989, Disney's animated film, THE LITTLE MERMAID ushered in a new golden era for both Disney and animation.  Widely recognized at the time as one of the best Disney films in decades, THE LITTLE MERMAID brought the beauty and joy of Disney animation to a new generation of audiences.  THE LITTLE MERMAID went on to become one of the most honored animated films of all time, garnering two Academy Awards, on for Best Music, Original Score and the other forBest Music, Original Song, ""Under The Sea.""The artistic beauty of THE LITTLE MERMAID shines through in every frame.  Artist James Coleman created exquisitely detailed backdrops for this film.  The songs of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman are classics in their own right:  memorable, toe-tapping, and fun...some of the very best in the Disney repertoire.  The characters themselves are unforgettable.  Ariel, Sebastian, Flounder, Ursula have all ascended to the pantheon of Disney greats.And of course, none of this describes how my 4 year old daughter feels about Ariel and THE LITTLE MERMAID.  Ariel's story of the THE LITTLE MERMAID who wanted feet, and her beauty, innocence, and fascination with the human world instantly propelled her into the ranks of the classic Disney princesses - Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White.  She is beloved by millions of little girls across generations, and my little one is no exception.  She is a strong female character who proves she can take care of herself, along with a little help from her friends.  I really like Ariel as a role model.This platinum addition DVD is a must have for any Disney, princess, or animation fans...or for the little princess in all of us.  My wee one and I love curling up on the sofa together to watch THE LITTLE MERMAID.  We become captivated by the story each time, and we love to sing-a-long.  It is a wonderful time together.

It really sucks that Disney only releases and re-releases their movies every couple of years.

I found this seller who was selling used copies in good condition.  I think I paid $28 for it, which I don't consider a bad price, considering when the re-release them, they mark them up to about $25 or $26.  I received this used DVD in perfect condition!

Ariel's spunky self, Eric's charming naivete, and even Ursula's cruel influence all make this film a keeper! A stunning Disney classic that features singing to develop characters, shift scenes, and change tone all told in the classic 2-d animated style. Every background is handpainted, all the characters are hand drawn, and best of all, Ariel is a strong role model for young girls. Eric plays the role of damsel in this film, giving Ariel plenty of time to try and win his affection through her rescues. The film focuses on the relationship between Ariel and Eric, though they don't officially go anywhere until the end of the film. But, it is well worth the wait! Hilarious sequences starring Scuttle, Sebastian, and Flounder along with some of Ariel's misunderstood concepts about the human world.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3SGBLYWBCXJRW	Keith A. Mather	"At last, the DVD has finally arrived! I couldn't wait to get my hands on it when they released it in stores. My family and I purchased this movie the very day it was released, and we all loved it as we watched it together.The people at Disney certainly did an excellent job on improving the original movie. They totally cleaned it up, made the colors brighter, the images more vivid--they even enhanced the sound, too. This film has definitely received the special kind of treatment that few other movies get these days.I'll bet just about everybody knows the story of the Little Mermaid, with Ariel, the headstrong teenage mermaid; Eric, the handsome swashbuckling prince that wins Ariel's heart; King Triton, the ruler of the sea and Ariel's mighty (yet overly protective and highly prejudiced) father; Sebastian, the hilarious reggae crab; Flounder, the friendly yet paranoid fish and Ariel's dearest friend; Scuttle, the goodhearted yet bumbling seagull; and of course, Ursula, the nasty old witch who intends to steal Triton's crown and take over the whole sea.This movie is very romantic, and very thrilling too. My favorite scenes are the storm at sea and the intense battle against Ursula towards the end. Both scenes make me tingle just about every time I watch them. Aside from romance and action, there's plenty of humor in this movie as well, to keep things from being too serious or scary for little kids. Probably the best scene of humor is the ""Les Poissons"" scene, between Sebastian and the royal French chef, Louis. That scene is enough to crack anybody up.But what really makes this DVD a terrific purchase is the music. It totally has a grip on you, from the beginning to the end. The people who wrote and composed this kind of music are total geniuses.Throughout this entire movie, you are hardly bored for one minute. It is just so excellent, with a big capital ""E"".

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"Unless you've been under a rock for the past twenty years, you're probably familiar with the story of Disney's ""The Little Mermaid.""  Briefly, it's a tale of forbidden love.  A young mermaid (Ariel) longs to live topside with a young man called Eric.  Alas, her father doesn't want her going above the water because he worries about what might happen to her.  Throw in a bad deal made with a sea witch (the diabolically funny Ursula), a singing hermit crab, a friendly fish and a whacked-out seagull, and you've got all the fixin's necessary for a wonderful Disney tale.This platinum release of ""The Little Mermaid"" is packed with wonderful documentaries about the making of the little film that pretty much saved Disney's future, a short story set to music entitled ""The Little Matchgirl,"" and the expected deleted scenes and obligatory Disney Channel music video.  This particular video is by Ashley Tisdale of ""The Suite Life Of Zack and Cody.""  She remakes ""Kiss The Girl.""Another interesting feature on this edition is the ""park ride that was almost built.""  It gives the viewer a sneak peek into what would have become a ""Little Mermaid"" ride at one of the Disney parks.  The Imagineers can be invited along for the ride to give a brief explanation of everything involved in the ride.  If you've ever been to a Disney theme park, you'll feel right at home on this ""park ride.""Overall, this platinum edition is worth it for the film alone.  It's one of the last animated Disney films that still looks like a classic Disney film.  Long before the breakthrough technology of ""Toy Story"" and the rigid, yet interesting, design of ""Hercules,"" ""The Little Mermaid"" was a nod to a time from Disney's past where ""Cinderella"" and ""Peter Pan"" ruled the big screen, and ""Herbie"" had yet to meet Lindsay Lohan.Highly recommended."	4.0	Ariel's Tale	2006-10-10	2	2	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	ABLKO3TSRPKPP	Kristina Thompson	When I first saw this movie a decade ago I found it enchanting.  The music is wonderful, the voices perfect, and the movie is full of beautiful scenes and choreography.  Once I started to ponder the message it sends however, I became far less enthralled with the movie.When you get right down to it, this is the message:Young girl sees good-looking guy one time at drunken party and on sight alone develops a crush on him.Same young girl subsequently defies her father and risks everything--life, family, future--on a chance to hook up with the object of her crush.Now don't get me wrong, I am very pleased that it all worked out for our beautiful and charming cartoon heroine.  I'm glad she didn't get killed, didn't end up homeless on the streets prostituting herself for survival, didn't contract an STD, and that against the odds she got her man, that they actually ended up loving one another, and the man turned out to be of good character and not a mentally or physically abusive sociopath.I am sorry to have to bring up the grim realities of life and human relationships, but in any thorough analysis, we must all look on the product as a whole.  In senior English, we were expected to find the underlying theme of the book, as well as aspects of the book's tone, any symbolism, or other literary techniques.  The fact is that the underlying theme or message in this Disney movie is grossly irresponsible.  I like the movie for a number of its aspects, but it is NOT appropriate for children.  The fact that it is a Disney cartoon and is G-rated and thus PURPORTS to be appropriate for all ages makes that message even more disturbing.As a parent I will not allow this movie to be in my house.  With the whole world full of options for enriching experiences to have, books to read, and far better shows to watch, this will not be missed.	2.0	Artistically and musically beautiful, but a dubious message	2009-08-03	23	6	17

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	Disney's renaissance saw a return to form after the disappointing Oliver and Company. The Little Mermaid not only saw the return of the great studio as a major driving force in cinematic imagination but also rejuvenated the art of animation itself. Released in the summer of 1989, Little Mermaid tells the classic Hans Christian Andersen tale of a mermaid who yearns to explore the world above the ocean. Inspired by the work of David Towns and Michael Peraza, the film became one of the most articulately- composed and artfully contrived animated novel adaptations in cinema history. The late Alan Menken's influence on the film's fantastically catchy underwater songs like 'Under the Sea' is all too obvious, but that's great homage to a truly gifted musician. The icing on the cake would be winning 2 Academy awards for best song and best musical score. Not bad for a animated musical and a great shot in the arm.Understandably the head honchos were concerned with the source material, considering the fable's tragic finale, but a couple of tweaks, a new ending and a singing Jamaican crab later, and the film was ready to set sail. The animation took a great leap from Disney's so-so input in the mid 80s, where the studio had reached a creativity apathetic nadir. If you want to argue (And you shouldn't) it should be noted that like Aladdin, the love struck mermaid is somewhat underwritten, surrounded by dancing fish she somewhat fails to reach the emotional peak the character needs to sell the ending. But thankfully there are some quiet scenes amidst the frenetic musical numbers. The voice actors are great, especially Jodi Benson as Ariel the title mermaid. From here the studio would go on to the even more impressive Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. Arguably their finest hour, it is undoubtedly one of their most impressive and creative tales.	5.0	Disney's renaissance saw a return to form	2005-07-09	12	10	2

Waring	"Walt Disney Studio's 1989 animated adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson's classic tale ""The Little Mermaid"" is known for being the beginning of the Disney animation renaissance of the 1990s.  While no movie collection is complete without this gem of a film, wait for the October 2006 2-Disc Platinum Edition DVD release.  Judging from Disney's treatment of their other classic films' transfers to Platinum Editions, Disney will do this movie the justice it deserves AND it will most likely be less expensive buying this new edition with all its extras than it will be to buy the currently available 1-Disc product from a private seller.  So, if you can wait a few months for the headstrong Ariel, the charming Sebastian, and the deliciously evil Ursula, it will be more than worth the wait!"	5.0	Wait for Platinum Edition this October 2006!	2006-03-27	66	54	12

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2Q8HSUEDV7BXW	Laura	"With the new two-disc platinum edition of this beloved classic out for sale, why not brush up on a little history? Based on the traditional Hans Christian Anderson tale, Walt Disney Feature Animation released their film adaptation of The Little Mermaid on November 14, 1989 to positive reviews. The movie drew in $84 million during its initial opening and earned $211 million in total lifetime gross. This movie is considered the first of a period known as the Disney Renaissance, which would soon usher in other blockbusters like The Lion King, Aladdin, and Hercules.Jodi Benson was cast in the lead voice of Ariel during the film's earliest stages of production. Although Benson was primarily a stage actress up to this point, Disney selected her because director Rom Clements felt it was critical that Ariel's speaking and singing voice be recorded by the same person, which was not customary of Disney productions. Christopher Barnes was cast as the charming Prince Eric, and Pat Carroll voiced the notorious sea witch Ursula.The inspiration for this film rests in an old copy of Christian Anderson's fables that Rom Clements stumbled upon shortly after The Great Mouse Detective's release. He immediately wrote up a two-page proposal for Disney CEO Mike Eisner, who accepted the idea warmly. John Musker, Clement's co-director on The Great Mouse Detective, wrote a twenty-page outline that was quickly approved for a storyboard.Glen Keanne and Mark Henn were assigned to oversee the animation of Ariel. According to Keanne, Ariel's body is based on Alyssa Milano from Who's the Boss? while her underwater characteristics derive from American astronaut Sally Ride's movements in space. Keane was also originally assigned to design the creation of the villain Ursula, who was based off a drag performer named Divine. The character was drawn to align with the voice of Bea Arthur from the Golden Girls, but Arthur turned down the part. Other minor characters like Sebastian and King Triton were each allotted their own artist for creation and animation.While animation and storyboard were in the primary stages of development, a group of highly skilled musicians were brought together. Acclaimed off-Broadway writer Howard Ashman teamed up with composer Alan Menken to create a Broadway-styled musical score that would highlight the plot through memorable musical numbers. Ashman is largely possible for the reggae undertones that are present throughout the film, as it was his idea to change the servant Sebastian to Jamaican descent as opposed to English.More money was spent on producing The Little Mermaid than any other previous Disney film, due largely in part to the opening of a satellite feature animation facility in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The studio's first projects include a Roger Rabbit cartoon short, in addition to hosting the major production behind The Little Mermaid.In order to capture the essence of being underwater, Disney would have to utilize a vast amount of special effects that hadn't been used since Fantasia in 1940. Mark Dindal, head of special effects, estimated that over one million bubbles were drawn. Other techniques like airbrushing, backlighting, superimposition, and minimal computer animation were also used to create a convincing underwater wonderland.Although minimal computer animation was used, The Little Mermaid was the last Disney feature animation to use hand-painted cells, which had previously been used for all films. Immediately following the movie's release, Disney would begin using a Pixar-created software, Computer Animation Painting System (CAPS,) for digital coloring and scanning multiple images together.Another unique tactic used for the creation of this film was using live action models to animate character motion. This practice was common in the 1940s and 1950s under the supervision of Walt Disney for films like Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. Sherri Lynn Stoner of the Los Angele's Groundlings improvisation comedy group was chosen to exaggerate Ariel's motions during key scenes, which animators could replay at a later time to capture lifelike motion.The Little Mermaid is a critical component of Disney animation history for several reasons. First, The Little Mermaid was the first animated fairy tale since Sleeping Beauty in 1959, proving that contemporary audiences were receptive to that story-telling medium. Second, this film assured Disney that feature animations were a profitable venue again. For years before The Little Mermaid's release, Disney's profit relied heavily on theme park and merchandise revenue.In January of 1990, The Little Mermaid's success was put to the ultimate test, the Academy Awards. The film won two Oscars, for best song (""Under the Sea"") and best musical score. The Little Mermaid was the first Disney film to win an Academy Award since The Rescuers in 1977.In addition to success at the Oscars, the film also received two awards at the 1990 Grammys. The film won Best Album for Children and Best Soundtrack for a Motion Picture, Television, or Other Visual Media. In 1990, the soundtrack sold two million copies worldwide, an unprecedented sales record for an animated soundtrack at that time. Since then, The Little Mermaid soundtrack has been certified six-time platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.However, not long after the film's release controversy arose. Consumers claimed that on the cover image, hidden among the turrets of King Triton's castle, was an alleged penis. Disney denied these claims, insisting that any similarity to the male genitalia was completely coincidental. The cover artists apologized for the mishap, blaming it on a late-night rush to finish the cover art before its first release. The image does not appear on the cover art for the film's second release.Another controversy arose when a woman from Arkansas claimed that the priest officiating the wedding ceremony at the end of the film can be seen with an erection. The image is extremely small and difficult to distinguish. The woman sued The Walt Disney Company in 1995 but dropped the lawsuit two months later.While nearly all Disney fans are familiar with this princess classic, few people realize how groundbreaking and revolutionary The Little Mermaid was in reestablishing The Walt Disney Company's presence in cartoon animation. By initiating an era of success known as the Disney Renaissance, this film will go down in history both in animation and in the hearts of avid Disney-lovers."	5.0	The History of The Little Mermaid	2013-04-18	8	5	3

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A19RAJY6R7USN0	"Lee Neville ""emotionboy"""	The Little Mermaid was the last in the line of fully hand drawn animated Disney features. The story of a little mermaid named Ariel who wishes to explore the land above the sea, is supported by the music of Alan Menken and the lyrics of the late Howard Ashman. It was The Little Mermaid that heralded the renaissance of Disney animation and led to classics such as Beauty & The Beast and Aladdin. I'm not really going to go into too much detail, but suffice it to say, The Little Mermaid is an animated classic that will stay in a beloved part of your memory forever.This is the first limited release issue onto DVD. This edition of The Little Mermaid was a re-release in 1998 featuring improved sound and picture, but not to worry, there is no change to the content of the film itself. The DVD is presented in widescreen with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, and it has no special features to speak of.Obviously you will be buying this DVD because you truly love The Little Mermaid. I actually own the first VHS video release, and this 1998 re-release edition on VHS video, yet I still bought this DVD, just so I could see the film with the best quality picture and sound. I'm sure I'll buy the 2-Disc Platinum Edition DVD with actual special features when it's released on its new brought forward release time of October 2006. (Other brought forward release dates include Cinderella in October 2005, Lady & The Tramp in March 2006, The Jungle Book in March 2007 and 101 Dalmations in October 2007). And I'm sure I'll buy the High Definition DVDs too at some point in the future- all for love of The Little Mermaid.

All 6 channels of sound were strong without being harsh, and convey a sense of beauty.The film is all about the triumph of human spririt.  I'm sure that the girls will relate to the princess, but my son was impressed as well.Thanks Disney for doing such a great job in remastering this classic.  I will keep it in my library for the princesses in my family.	5.0	5 Stars*****Remastered Little Mermaid is Spectacular*****Five Stars	2006-10-23	5	4	1

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A22KM2QK0PT2O	Literary Lady	"This movie is awful. I loved it when I was a kid, but now I see how bad it really is. Ariel is annoying, and an airhead. Just like everyone else has said, I find it ridiculous how she gave up everything just to be with a guy she saw from a distance. And Eric didn't know anything about her. He just saw a mute girl with a pretty face and just all of a sudden fell in love with her? Ridiculous. And I find how obsessed she is with Eric to be annoying and creepy. She was flirting with a statue of him for goodness sakes! Do yourself a favor and do not buy this movie for your daughters to be messed up like Ariel and make them feel they have to give up everything for a man. And FYI, in the Hans Christian Anderson story, she goes through excrutiating pain and risks her life just to be with the Prince. And in the end turns into sea foam b/c he does not marry her and she can't bring herself to kill him. What a ""romantic"" story."	1.0	Watch this movie if you want to teach your daughters how to be obsessed stalkers!	2009-02-22	35	8	27

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3NYZB4V55CZIM	Liz	The Little Mermaid is the first Disney movie I remember my parents taking me to see (I was 4 years old). So, The Little Mermaid holds a pretty special place in my heart. That's why I was thrilled to find out that The Little Mermaid was being released from the Disney Vault. The one I purchased was the 2-disc &#34;Diamond Edition&#34; which is really just Disney's fancy way of saying &#34;combo pack.&#34; What's nice about the Diamond Editions is that they really aren't much differently priced than pruchasing the movie on DVD or blu-ray separately. Additionally, Disney is now including digital copies with their combo packs, and they don't just have to be redeemed on iTunes. They can also be redeemed on Ultraviolet services too, such as Vudu or Flixster.	5.0	Finally The Little Mermaid gets a Diamond Edition release!	2014-05-13	1	1	0

I do not actually own this particular dvd set myself, but I was considering it. I just want to let those of you who don't already know and are considering buying this overpriced single disk dvd, DON'T. According to [...] in their upcoming dvd releases, The Little Mermaid will be released as a special PLATINUM VERSION in Oct. 2006 of next year. That is a fact. (Check the website yourself if you don't believe me.) I know it is awhile to wait, but it will be worth it. Besides, some were saying earlier on these reviews that we might not be getting the Little Mermaid Platinum til 2008! So this is much better!

Amazingly well-developed characters that come to life with incredible voice acting. And no heavy-handed morality tale. And Ursula is probably one of a handful of villains I actively like because she's so deliciously evil.I watched the VHS so much as a child I had the entire film's dialogue as well as songs memorised.

Montoya	I love the movie The Little Mermaid and when it went out as a Special Edition I decided to buy it right away.  I did not open it until my nephews/nieces stayed at my house for a sleep over on Dec 21.  I put the dvd for them and noticed that the dvd did not have the voice/action synchronize for a good part of the movie.  My nephews/nieces were more concentrated on noticing the errors than in the movie itsel. Total fiasco.  I couldn't return it because your return policy specifies 30 days after purchase as limit to return an item.

In 1989, when Mermaid was released, I was only 11. Yet, this did something so special: It brought me to animation and kept me enthralled even to this day! The colors, the visuals, the music score, everything about this awesome flick is unforgettable. The character development was so on point, that it shames the lack-luster features produced by other companies of that day and today! My favourite character is URSULA! Gosh, what a woman!! I wanted to marry her, ofcourse that wasn't possible - (1) she was a collage of animated cells, and (2) she was unjustly killed in the climax! Disney and Buena Vista Dist. will release The Little Mermaid as a 2-disc Platinum/Special Edition October 3, 2006! Time cannot go fast enough for me as this would make my year. Long overdue, this release will re-introduce this amazing creation to fans of old, and a whole new generation. With a multitude of extras, this will be a collector's dream!! I only hope (as proven in the past with other Platinum releases around that time) that a special Collector's DVD Gift Set will follow. Now THAT would be perfect!!!	5.0	Disney Revived!	2006-04-11	11	3	8

This is definitely one of Disney's best productions.By the way, when you watch it... there are two interesting things that my friends and I noticed.. first, in the first half, in one of the scenes on the boat, one of the sailor's shirts change colors while Prince Eric is talking. Second, when the Ariel is in his castle, they put her to bed and she doesn't have any sheets or blankets... notice what happens just a few seconds later...	5.0	under the sea...	2004-03-04	0	0	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3E832FY3AIKFT	"Mark Clegg ""Nathan's Dad"""	Snow White heralded the start of Disney's first phase of classic feature animations. Cinderella kicked off the second phase. Ariel here started the most recent stretch of 'Disney Classics'.The phrase 'Disney Classics' is bandied around too much and basically describes any of Disney's theatrically released animated movies (Disney's 'Classic' The Black Cauldron anyone?). This film however deserves the Classic label and, along with The Lion King, Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast, is one of the run of 'Classics' of the 1990s. Although this run was broken with Pocahontas (ignoring Rescuers Down Under) and has only recovered fitfully over the intervening years (the last 'Classic' was probably in reality Lilo and Stitch), The Little Mermaid deserves real credit for bringing the Disney Studios standards back up so high in such a short space of time. It's amazing to think that the ho-hum Oliver & Co was released the year before.The success of the film probably has it's roots in the employment of Ashman and Menken as lyrist and composer. As well as writing the songs, they became heavily involved in the story and so Little Mermaid plays more like a Broadway musical than a traditional 'cartoon'. This would be even more evident in Beauty and the Beast (later to become a stage show) and Menken's death during Aladdin's genesis is, I believe, still being felt by the studio.So with a great score and story, Little Mermaid holds all of the trump cards by also having a great script (socially relevant), well-rounded characters (even down to the support players), perfect voice casting (stand up Sam Wright!) and almost perfect animation (some small sections have obviously been rushed but not so they would spoil the film). The film was so successful that it also started the now obligatory Disney spin-off cycle, with a TV show, record albums and a slew of merchandising.Extras on this disc are not yet confirmed but, since Disney has always lead the way in DVD technology, will no doubt include a comprehensive 'making of', deleted songs/scenes, interviews etc. Disney's balance of 'for the fans' and 'for the kids' is perfect and I doubt whether many 'fans' can resist the excellent games that always accompany a new Disney DVD release.So buy this and marvel at the start of Disney's third-coming while we wait for the fourth.	5.0	Make this 'Part of Your World'	2006-06-05	9	5	4

If you may remember, when Disney started releasing DVDs, ""The Little Mermaid"" was one of their first releases. Suffice it to say, the LE was overpriced, completely barebones, had a grainy transfer, and the menus left somewhat to be desired.Well, Disney has finally rectified that problem. On October 3, 2006 ""The Little Mermaid"" will be re-released as a new 2 disc set. The movie has been digitally restored with a new anamorphic transfer and will feature a brand-new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix (along with regular Dolby Digital 5.1). The extras offered will be games, never-before-seen deleted footage, music videos, trailers, and many other goodies (hopefully a commentary will be included).Suffice it to say, throw out or give away that outdated 1999 Limited Edition DVD and replace it with this one. There's too much good stuff in here (plus improved sound and picture quality).

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A370Z6I5GBWU44	"M ""Delicious Strawberry"""	I saw this movie when I was very young, and just like nearly any little girl, I was enthralled with it. This is a significant departure from Hans Christian Andersen's 'The Little Mermaid' because the original story was considerably darker.In the original version of the tale, the Sea Witch is not actually evil even if she is dark. Here, Ursula is evil, with a personal vendetta against Triton and she sees Ariel as a good chance to lash out at him. Just like in the original story, the little mermaid loses her voice in exchange for her legs. However, unlike the tale, Ariel does not go through excruciating pain with each step she takes on her human feet.Like in many Disney movies, there's lots of singing and animal friends. There was a particularly memorable one where the sea life goes into song and dance, and it was a lot of fun to watch.Having seen this again recently, I'm more cynical and jaded, and didn't enjoy this movie quite as much. Ariel is a stereotypical Princess who thinks it's funny to tempt danger by having a shark chase her among other things. Her father admonishes her to not go to the surface or anything, and he does so because he wants his daughters to be safe. And with this immaturity, it's hard to believe that she would find her true love when she is just sixteen.	4.0	Typical Disney fare	2011-01-06	0	0	0

Following closely behind Pocahontas, Little Mermaid was a favourite Disney movie of mine. I had the doll (with removable tail) and also the Eric doll - although I preferred my Ken doll.I still prefer the older Disney movies to the ones these days. These days, it's all about the celebrity voices, and how many you can spot before the credits roll. Back in the days of Little Mermaid, Cinderella etc, there are no celebrity voices. And it makes you slip into the movie easier, without having to think of the voice, before you can concentrate on the film.Little Mermaid still holds the magic it had for me when I was young. I remember being so scared when I was younger that I actually used to skip the bits featuring Ursula, the sea witch. Now, I laugh, but I still feel that same old fear. Especially the ending. Was I the only one freaked out by that?!Little Mermaid will shown to my kids (when I have them), rather than Cars, or any other recent Disney movies. I just don't get them. And I have no urge to watch them.	3.0	Happy Memories	2007-01-04	2	0	2

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3U16LBR0AF8H8	M. Hsu	People need to be VERY cautious when buying Little Mermaid. This DVD has been out of print so long that it is actually quite rare to find a truly new disc. I've actually had the misfortune of buying several Disney DVD's at auction only to find that they are counterfeit discs even though the box is shrinkwrapped. I e-mailed the seller of one of these DVD's and found out that apparently there are a lot of people who separately buy counterfeit DVD's in bulk (usually from Asia) along with packaging materials.  They then assemble all the stuff together, shrinkwrap the whole thing (yes, people actually buy shrinkwrapping machines to do this!) and sell it as new on the web. This also explains all those electronic auctions where the seller makes the outrageous claim that their DVD's don't ship in a hard case but instead come in a more protective sleeve (which is BS) or they're trying to save you shipping (that's because they don't have the authentic cases to send you).So how can you determine whether you disc is authentic or not?  Well, from my experience, several things have clued me in to a particular disc being fake. First start with the packaging. Any authentic Disney (or any brand) DVD has tamper-proof stickers that must be torn or removed to get to the disc. There is always a sticker on top, but some titles also have them on the side and bottom too. Almost all (although I have seen some exceptions) Disney DVD's have shrinkwrap that are stamped with a Buena Vista logo so you can tell if the shrinkwrap was put on at the factory or done by someone else. Also, since counterfeiters frequently are putting everything together themselves look for abnormal signs of wear and tear. For example, if you see a scratch or dent on the paper cover artwork, but the case itself is physically fine, you should be suspicious as to how the artwork could have been damaged if it is supposed to be new and the case itself is undamaged. Another sign I've encountered (and rather obvious one) that a DVD is re-packaged is that the DVD itself will have scratches and/or fingerprints on it. When's the last time you picked up a brand new DVD from a store and found the disc to have scratches and/or fingerprints? That's right - never.Now the most important way of determining whether a disc is authentic or not is to check the content on the DVD, specifically the size of all the data on the DVD. For this step you'll need to put the DVD into a computer to find out the size of the DVD. For example, the fake Little Mermaid DVD I got off eBay showed up as having 3.6 GB of data. This immediately raised a flag in my head because the back of the Little Mermaid DVD packaging claims that the disc is in dual-layer format. Dual-layer format DVD's are only used for movies that have more than ~4.5 GB of data. In fact a search on the internet revealed that the authentic Little Mermaid DVD was supposed to have 5 GB of data ([...] The fact the data of my DVD wasn't more than a single layer's worth meant that the content of my DVD had been compressed and was a counterfeit. Furthermore, it explained why the quality of the movie was so bad. So check if the packaging says that the disc is in dual-layer format, the data takes up more than ~4.5 GB of data, or even better see if you can find the exact size of the disc from an online review.If Disney cared about the damage these low-quality discs have on their reputation, they should clamp down on the rampant sale of counterfeits of their movies online. BTW, after discovering this new world of Disney fakes, I finally was able to find an authentic, new Little Mermaid DVD. People who are selling authentic discs usually know they are rare & valuable and typically charge more (think ~upper $20's to $40's) than the bootleggers.BTW, to explain my rating of the DVD - I would have given the movie 5 stars for the movie, but knocked off 1 star for the lack of extras. We all know Disney can put out some really high caliber releases which, unfortunately, this being one of the earlier DVD's is not one of them.	4.0	Are you sure you got an authentic disc?	2005-09-11	76	61	15
0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2ZDAI1GTR434H	M. Huss	I've been thrilled with the beautiful blu-ray transfers of most of Disney's animated classics. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, a film over 30 years old, received such an excellent blu-ray upgrade that you can see the brush strokes in the backgrounds. Likewise, older films like Robin Hood have featured clean, vivid pictures. So I thought that surely The Little Mermaid, one of Disney's premiere titles, would receive a similar deluxe treatment.Boy, was I wrong.From the opening scene, the grainy picture that was so prevalent on the dvd is back in spades in the blu ray. Though most prevalent in underwater and nighttime scenes (and &lt;SPOILER ALERT!> most of the movie takes place underwater,) even daylight scenes are afflicted by the occasional grainy sequence. Even character cels, which should be filled with flat color, often look like they're full of digital noise.I find it hard to believe that Disney could restore 30, 40 and 50 year-old movies to their original luster but not one of their more (relatively) recent hits. And they call this a Diamond Edition?More like Cubic Zirconia.	2.0	This grainy blu-ray should have been left Under the Sea!	2013-10-02	11	6	5
0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2YK5AV68BGBI3	"Miami ""Rugby Man"""	The movie is Great!! Don't take me wrong. The reason why I gave 3 points instead of 5 is because of the languages issue. Disney's movies in the past gave you the options to buy multi-language movies, we are Latin's and we would like to pass that to our kids. Disney's translations to other languages are THE BEST so is a good teaching to our kids to watch the movie in Spanish one time and the next in English, like that they learns both languages well. But Now Disney doesn't give you the alternative to buy one movie with 3 options of languages on it. You have to buy EVERY version with the language you desire. Before you paid $23+ for a multi-language movie today you pay $15 for one with only the option in English.	3.0	Little Mermaid Movie	2007-01-11	1	0	1

Only big screw up is the flipping of a couple scenes in the Part Of Your World song. Also when Ariel and Eric jump off Ursula a black bar appears for a second.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A38ZTUNQJVGP6S	Michael Patrick Boyd	The Little Mermaid is one hour and twenty-five minutes and was released in theaters on November 14, 1989. This was the 28th animated film to be released by Disney Studios and the first of ten movies of the Disney Renaissance era (1989 to 1999). The Little Mermaid tells the story of Ariel who is bored with life under the sea and wants to know more about the human world. One evening Ariel rescues Prince Eric from drowning and brings him to shore. Before she leaves Prince Eric sees her face and hear hers voice for a brief moment. When her father, King Triton, hears about this, he goes into a hissy fit and destroys Ariel collection of human artifacts. Ariel is in tears and a pair of eels named Flotsam and Jetsam convinces her to see Ursula. Ursula strikes a deal with Ariel. She gives Ariel three day for the Prince to fall in love with her and it must be love true kiss and she has to do this without her voice. Prince Eric and Ariel come close but are foiled by Flotsam and Jetsam. Ursula sees this and turns herself human and uses Ariel singing voice to trick Prince Eric. Prince Eric and Ursula are about to tie the knot when the cavalry comes to the rescue. The shell that is holds Ariel voice in broken and she gets her voice back but it is too late. Ariel changes back into a mermaid and Ursula takes her back to sea. Prince Eric not wanted to loose her again goes after and a good old Disney fight\rescue breaks out and you know the rest of the story.Some trivia about this movie; this was the first fairy tale movie since Sleeping Beauty and the last movie to use hand-painted cels and analog camera. This was the first Disney movie to receive an Academy Award since Bedknobs and Broomsticks. The two Academy Awards the movie won were for Best Music, Original Score and Best Music, Original Song (Under The Sea). Kiss the Girl was also nominated for Original Song. The Little Mermaid also won two Grammy and Golden Globe awards. The Little Mermaid is a wonderful movie and gets an AAAAA+++++.DVD FEATURESChapter SelectionSet UpA. Spoken Languagesa. Englishb.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1O6769UB30EYT	Michael S. Boardley	"I was excited to buy this product for my two daughters, but was hugely disappointed with the lack of restoration quality and sound.It seems as if Disney's idea of ""Remastering & Restoration"" is adding a few computer generated scenes and and a few sound effects here and there.I feel used and abused when it comes to the blantant false advertising of the ""Games & Activities"" section on the ""bonus"" DVD. What a total waste!This ""Games & Activities"" section is nothing more than a plug for their Disneyland attraction. My daughters were very upset as well. They were looking forward to ""playing"" a game.Please, Please, save your money and don't buy this piece of Disney ""Remasterd & Restored"" trash.I will sell mine to the first buyer for 12.00.

As a mom of a 4.5 year old girl I wanted it, but also for myself as it's a great movie.  My son also enjoys watching it (3 years old).  It's a fun movie with great music and Ursula!  I don't know that I ever realized it before...but to me she is the best Disney villain!  She is so fun in her nastiness!  I love her songs and sassiness.  She is such a monster but somehow likable until the end anyway.  Sweet movie that is a lot of fun with many lovable characters.  There are the usual stereotypes at play but the entertainment is there and my kids laugh out loud at the scenarios between Sebastian and the chef.  I love hearing that laughter!	5.0	Fun and entertaining	2013-11-05	0	0	0
0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	AURZ4YQ270W3T	Mike Freed	&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; is a smashing blend of romance, action, music, and superb Disney animation.We all know the story, don't we? Little Ariel is a mermaid who wants to be part of the world beyond the sea,  but her father (the king of an undersea nation) wants her &quot;under the  sea&quot;, where he thinks she belongs. Ariel falls in love with a human  prince and trades her lovely singing voice to the evil Sea-Witch so that  she can be with him.Will Ariel wed the handsome prince, make her dad  understand what she wants, and defeat the evil Sea-Witch? It's a Disney  flick, folks...that's all one need say.The film is a delight from start  to finish, but I have to give special mention the music and songs (by Alan  Menken and the late Howard Ashman), which span yearning (&quot;Part of Your  World&quot;), salesmanship (&quot;Under the Sea&quot;), and  barely-concealed evil (&quot;Poor Unfortunate Souls&quot;). The score and  musical numbers are a sheer delight (and the ones for Ashman and Menken's  next project, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, are even better), and  you'll be humming them for weeks after seeing this film.It also bears  mentioning that unlike many other Disney cartoons, in which the violence  level is quite high for a G-rated film, the violence in &quot;The Little  Mermaid&quot; is very restrained; of all the recent Disney films, this is  the one best suited for young children.And if your young kids are like  my daughter, they'll soon be telling you they want to be mermaids, just  like Ariel.Enjoy!	5.0	Magical entertainment for the whole family	2000-06-29	11	9	2

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1WGENT65DGQF0	Minagpa	"1. Hoard found treasures, do not attempt to restore them to their owners.2. Maintain a secret stash of gold, hidden even from your family. Revel in it. Let the gold be where your heart is.3. Disobey every parental instruction possible. Show no remorse, quickly dismiss repentance.4. Do not respect your father (of course you have no mother, this is Disney). And show no respect for any other creature either. You have all the answers after all, and a happy ending will prove that to everyone, esp yourself.5. View your family (sisters in this case) as evil and entirely against you. Do anything you can to make it on your own, get away from them, and achieve something better, while excluding them from your life.6. Focus strongly, even exclusively, on your youth and beauty, not your character or values. As beauty is what lands a rich and handsome man (again, the qualities which matter most). What will happen when you age?7. Do indeed work with Satanic Black Magicians, as the results will be positive, in the end. Remember, never forget, the ends ALWAYS justify the means!8. Self-serving rules! Look out for number one. Be sure to shun those that stand in your way! Trick them if you can. Tell lies if possible to deceive them. Always use the back door. You know what's right. ""They"" do not.9. Do not bother with your commitments or obligations, these are tiresome! And they do not serve you personally, at this time! Show irritation if some naysayer attempts to remind you of your obligations.10. All and all an excellent film for young girls to watch over and over and over. Highly recommended."	1.0	PLEASE do NOT read this review. You will NOT like it!	2013-07-25	20	3	17

But I wonder why Disney didn't make this a Platinum Edition DVD set?

The Little Mermaid made the way for new musicals such as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King.  I guarantee that EVERYONE will find something to fall in love with.  It could be the songs, Ariel, Sebastian, Flounder or Scuttle.  Visually it is delightful and the animation is so fluent.  The character design was consistent.  The songs make you want to dance and the movie makes you feel like a kid, weither you are one or you are 100.  Buy this movie, if not for yourself.  then your children, or grandchildren, nieces or nephews.  It is one that you definately want to add to your disney collection.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3W45U5VLS64UI	Mommy of Lily	"The Little Mermaid was my favorite movie when I was 5 and it was just released. Now I have a daughter of my own who is 2 and has already taken an interest in Ariel so when I seen they were releasing it I had to get it. I'm disappointed the dvd only release isn't until December 1st since all of my daughter's Disney movies are on that format. I noticed one of the combos come in dvd packaging and asked my husband to pick that one up for us but he came home with this one. There was no way my daughter was waiting on a return to the store so we kept this one. The movie was just as good as I remember and I think it looks great. I was nervous it would look very dated as some other Disney movies I've seen tend to look even after being ""remastered'. My daughter enjoyed it and we've watched it several times already. I was disappointed that some of the extras weren't on the dvd disk(the crab-e-oke). I'm guessing they're on the blu-ray disk but haven't checked it out yet. My access to a blu-ray player is my husband's PS3 so we normally just use a dvd player for my daughter. I was able to download the digital copy on itunes and all the extras were on there. I loved that so I still rate it 5 stars for that reason. Now I have access to the movie on my computer and iphone. I always feel like these movies are overpriced but for all the formats I got with this one it was worth it. Will probably purchased these combopacks in the future because of this."	5.0	As good as I remember	2013-10-20	1	1	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2UQIIJ2CD8REE	Monty Moonlight	"In a wonderful kingdom under the sea lives the beautiful mermaid princess, Ariel, seventh and youngest daughter of King Triton, ruler of Atlantica. Ariel's feisty spirit and gorgeous red hair make her a bit of a favorite among Triton's daughters, and her passion for learning human ways and collecting of their artifacts causes much stress to her family and friends. After spying a handsome, young, human prince aboard a ship one evening and saving his life, Ariel is instantly love-struck, and this is completely unacceptable to her overbearing, human-hating father. In a desperate and rebellious action, Ariel turns to a seductive sea witch for help, who takes possession of Ariel's beautiful voice in exchange for a magical spell. The spell changes Ariel's fish-like tail into a lovely pair of human legs, but there is a condition attached. If Ariel can't get the young prince to fall in love with her in three days and seal it with a kiss, the spell will be broken and Ariel will join the witch Ursula's collection of hideously transformed victims. Luckily, the prince is in love with her already, though he doesn't know it. Prince Eric is obsessed with finding the young lady who saved him from drowning that night and whom he caught a glimpse of as she sang to him just before disappearing. When he takes in the now human Ariel after she appears seemingly washed up from a shipwreck, her inability to speak makes him sure she is not the one. Voiceless and only left with her beauty and exuberant charm, Ariel and her animal friends must try their best to make the prince see that she is the lost love he has been searching for, but the Sea Witch will do all she can to stop them before time runs out! If Ursula holds power over Princess Ariel, the king himself will have to bow down before her!Like ""Cinderella"" and ""Snow White"" before it, ""The Little Mermaid,"" released in 1989, single-handedly saved Walt Disney Animation from total vaporization. Following a bit too modestly performing releases and the underrated but still not up to par flop, ""The Black Cauldron,"" this was a last chance for Disney animators to prove animation could still draw and please the film going public; and, boy, did they ever prove it! With just the right combination of story, music, voice talent, and visuals, ""The Little Mermaid"" turned out to be one of the Disney Studios' most perfect achievements! The Oscar winning music is particularly noteworthy, as one of  the film's most groundbreaking moves was bringing a Broadway style to its musical storytelling. This was thanks to the amazing team of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who would return to do more brilliant Disney music during the so-called ""Renaissance"" kicked-off by ""The Little Mermaid."" Voice talents that must be mentioned are Disney legend Buddy Hackett as the voice of Scuttle, Ariel's dizzy Seagull friend, Samuel E. Wright as Sebastian, the little Caribbean crab that often steals the show, and, of course, Ariel the little mermaid herself, graced with the heavenly voice of Broadway actress Jodi Benson. Pat Carroll does a phenomenal job as the loathsome Ursula, and Christopher Daniel Barnes manages to be a vast improvement on past, rather bland Disney princes. The film, of course, is based on the famous fairytale by Hans Christian Anderson. The original story is actually a bit of a downer, something Anderson had a flair for, and the one, rare complaint that viewers sometimes make about the movie is how much it strays for its Disneyfied rewrite of the story, particularly with its happy ending. But, this complaint doesn't come up that often, and Disney's take successfully carries on the original theme of a mermaid wanting more than her under-sea life will allow. It also beautifully and convincingly handles the father/daughter relationship and the difficult issue of letting go when the time is right. ""The Little Mermaid"" continues to be one of Disney's most beloved animated classics, and with good reason. It is no less than a masterpiece.Now, this is easily one of my favorite Disney animated features. I suppose it is for most Disney fans, but with me there's an added incentive: I am absolutely in love with Ariel! Have been since she first splashed onto the big screen! I mean, she's pretty much perfection, with that voice, that bubbly personality, that hair, those eyes, that nose, those lips (notice, I'm not commenting on those seashells, because I'm not a pig, but they're great too), ... and when she gets legs, whoa! I'm so in love with her that I bought one of those overpriced, framed Jodi Benson autographs at Disney World once, along with one of the collectible reproduction animation cels. And this was when I was a student! I mean, I really had to save up for stuff like that! Anyways, point is, I was naturally very psyched about this new, 2-disc, Platinum Edition release of the film. And, in general, I'm very happy with it. There are a few items I don't know why were left out. However, I thankfully found one of them later as one of the two Easter Eggs on disc Two. But, without further ado, here are some details on the DVDs:Disc One contains the flick itself (in anamorphic widescreen), beautifully restored (though some have complained that it has been overly restored and isn't EXACTLY how the film was meant to look, but it still looks great) but with some slight editing. Yes, editing. It appears that the old Urban Legend about the minister in the wedding scene being aroused has been addressed, and that knee of his that some people imagined to be a different body part has been redrawn. Moving on, Disc One also has a wonderfully informative and at times touching commentary with writer/directors Ron Clements and John Musker, and composer Alan Menken. The late Howard Ashman, lyricist, is included too at times via audio recordings. One music video is included, and this is where I voice one of my complaints of something else that should have been included too. The last VHS release of ""The Little Mermaid"" included a Jodi Benson video where she sings ""Part of Your World"" on a beach. This video is NOT the one included. What we get is a cute, Disney Channel star promoting video of Ashley Tisdale singing ""Kiss the Girl,"" and it's fine. I like it. I just think it's pretty bad that the Jodi Benson video wasn't included as well! Another Disc One extra is the Sing Along option for key musical moments in the film, though not all are included. We also are given a sneak peek of the extras on Disc Two, and the more interesting sneak peek at the upcoming sequel, ""The Little Mermaid 3."" It's a clip of a scene that seems to vaguely remind me of an episode of the animated series where Ariel discovers Sebastian moonlighting as a performer at an undersea nightclub. Speaking of, let's hope the success of this Platinum DVD inspires the DVD release of the wonderful animated series as well.Disc Two is where the majority of extra features can be found, and while I'm not blown away by the sheer amount of stuff (as I have been in some past Platinum releases), there's still lots of really neat stuff here. The main attraction here should be ""Treasures Untold: The Making of the Little Mermaid,"" which can be found in the Backstage Disney section, and it's certainly a great behind the scenes featurette on the making off the film, full of great interviews and insight into those difficult days at Disney Animation. However, one also wishes the old Disney Channel ""Making Of"" program was included too, hosted by Alyssa Milano (one of several supposed inspirations for Ariel), which would have had that wonderful ""real-time"" feeling that you don't get from ""after-the-fact"" interviews. Yes, that definitely should have been included in the ""Platinum Edition."" Anyway, as I said, the main attraction here SHOULD be the behind the scenes featurette, but there's something else very special on Disc Two of ""The Little Mermaid."" Two somethings, in fact. One is an unrelated Disney animated short film, ""The Little Match Girl."" It's a beautifully done piece with a true to the story ending (believe it or not) that was originally intended for the canceled ""Fantasia 2006."" No Disney fan should miss owning this amazing piece of Disney filmmaking! The other fantastically special something on Disc Two is filed under, believe it or not, Games and Activities. Yes, something GOOD under Games and Activities! It's an actual virtual ride on a Disney theme park attraction that was never created: an actual Little Mermaid ride! You can ""ride"" the ride by yourself, or with audio commentary, and there is even a featurette about the ride that ""Never Was."" Disc Two also features some great deleted scenes selections, an improved DisneyPedia that plays all in one chunk, the original theatrical trailer, the very cool early presentation reel, a retrospective featurette on the effects unit, a charming featurette that looks at Hans Christian Anderson's Little Mermaid in comparison with Disney's take, and, of course, the art galleries. I always enjoy seeing the character development galleries, particularly of Disney's loveliest females. These galleries could be more thorough though, as I love to see promotional/advertising art and merchandising images too. Speaking of, there are two Easter Eggs on the Treasures Untold Menu, as I think I mentioned earlier. Why the McDonald's ornament commercial was not included as a third, I have no idea. I mean, they got permission to show it and yet only showed a couple of seconds of it during the making of featurette. This commercial, with it's wonderful, exclusive animation of Ariel and her fish friend, Flounder, would have been a perfect Easter Egg. Anyway, what we do get is one Easter Egg of the writer/directors drawing caricatures of each other, which is cute, but I'd rather have the commercial, and another Easter Egg about the live-action referencing. Now, this second one is the Easter Egg I was so happy to find! As I mentioned, I was soooo in love with Ariel from the moment the film came out, and this extended to a love for her voice (Jodi Benson) and her live action reference model, Sherri Stoner, who was basically a brunette Ariel. I adored Sherri in that behind the scenes special from when the film first came out and was so disappointed that footage of her performing as Ariel for the animators was not included in ""Treasures Untold."" It wasn't even mentioned. She wasn't even mentioned! Well, while I do not feel it should have been relegated to an Easter Egg, I was so happy to find it after thinking none of it was included. It's not enough footage, we should have been given more, but it was still nice to see again along with the brief, recent interview moments with Sherri! And while I'm still sad that Jodi's video wasn't included as a Bonus Feature, that particular Easter Egg, plus ""The Little Matchgirl,"" plus the virtual theme park ride, and most importantly, the film itself, one of the best things ever to come from the Disney Studios, make this Platinum Edition DVD a MUST OWN!"	5.0	One of Disney's Finest Achievements!	2006-10-16	35	29	6

It looks like the original animation layers were redone such that foreground layers and the background were redone twice over, once for the left eye and once for the right eye, which works quite well. If nothing else, the color restoration and elimination of film grain are both excellent.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A21G4TR1PBPS7H	Movie_Fan	"We each have our own favorite Disney classic, this one happens to be mine.First off though, I want to thank Disney for bringing these classics back into our homes.  I missed the first DVD wave of disney's, which were apparently bad, and with this special Disney Platinum treatment, we get the very best, including with this edition of ""The Little Mermaid"".I hadn't watched ""The Little Mermaid"" in forever.  It just kind of sat in a box full of Disney VHS movies in a closet. This DVD made me rediscover my all-time favorite Disney classic.  Seeing it again brought back everything as to why I loved it.  I loved the characters, especially Sebastian (Even at my age, I still find the scene with the cook in the kitchen hilarious).And I still love it just as much today as I did 13 years ago.As I watch it today, I think the reason is that it's the first Disney ""Princess"" movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.  The only ones that came before the Little Mermaid were Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White.  It's the first one that dares be hilarious with songs like ""Les Poissons"" graphically depicting the killing and preparation of a fish for dinner, and also pokes fun at humans with ""Under the Sea"".  Plus the underwater theme is used perfectly.When I think about it, it was also kind of revolutionary as far as Disney's Princesses go : Ariel was the first one to have a prince with an actual name (aka Eric).  In the first three, the prince was always referred to as ""Prince charming"" if I'm not mistaken.I thought also that with the Little Mermaid, the dynamics changed between the girl and the prince (and thus paving the way for Beauty and The Beast).  He still had to go to great lengths to save Ariel, but unlike the other 3 previous Disneys, this one actually focused on the actual relationship between the two before the whole ""damsel in distress"" appears.  I also believe he's the first prince to be saved from a Disney Princess.I just think that it makes this Disney classic more approachable and relatable than the other ones.In any case, here the Little Mermaid is beautifully restored (except for the staircase CGI makeover at one point).  It's a beautiful movie that's absolutely worth adding to your collection of Disney's.  Even as a ""young"" adult, I find that the magic is still there, the music is still just as catchy and amazing (It won 2 Oscars for Best Song and Best Original Music), and even after a number of viewings, it's one of those movies you can't get enough of and you'll always love to see again and again.It's a must for any DVD collection.Just as an afterword, if you haven't gotten your hands on the special edition dvd of ""Bambi"" and ""Lady and The tramp"", now's the time to do it because they're going back into the vault at the end of January 2007!"	5.0	My personal favorite Disney classic	2006-10-14	2	1	1

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3AGZFOKWYIWRM	Mr. Mj Grant	I'd forgotten how good this film was, I really had, I had vague memories of being sat down in front of a video, and there was a large scary lady in purple doing bad things. But that was it, I'd forgotten how heart-warming and beautiful the film was.The first step toward making this film a true Disney masterpiece, is the fact that the story is so strong. I was totally engrossed by it, and didn't get bored for a moment. I had forgotten about the sweet scenes in the town and by the river, they are what a film needs, character development and just a slight expansion of the story beyond the basic bones of the tale. Sure, it's not a faithful rendition of the original tale, but it isn't about tragedy, it's about love and your dreams coming true.The animation, whilst not as accomplished as some of their slightly later films (such as the Hunchback of Notre Dame) is a delight to behold, and it really makes the mer-people seem very believable in the movement and actions. The animators of Ariel must of been very pleased with themselves, she comes across as being real (well, as real as a cartoon can be) I can see in her facial expressions will genuine expressions, not pale imitations as is so often the case in animation.The soundtrack really makes it, generally, I find Disney side-kicks obtrusive and annoying, but Sebastian makes the film, I never imagined reggae style music could manage to be romantic! The key song, is also beautiful, whilst I don't know the title (shameful I know) the words continue to soar through my mind, 'now we can run....etc.!'The extras are also very worthwhile, a fascinating making of, some games for the children and deleted scenes (utilising unused storyboards.) There is also a commentary and a new music video for 'Kiss the Girl.' However the best of them all has got to be the beautiful and tragic, 'The Little Match-Girl,' I can honestly say that few other films have managed to move me so deeply, I couldn't remembered the last time I cried over a film, until I saw this one. I knew it would be special when I watched the introduction by the director, he mentioned how he use to read the story to his children - it made me remember my parents use to read me the story too. I really hope that it will be Oscar Nominated - it deserves it.Equally satisfying for any child or film critic. A true classic.- Rachael -	5.0	Truly deserving of it's reputation...	2006-11-06	11	9	2

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2TY467QIEJ1DB	mthegreatone	"I remember having watched this movie many times when I was young.  I have since grown up, and this movie truly stands the test of time.  None of the movies Disney has been making now will ever come close to the hand-drawn classics they used to make before.  I'm not necessarily saying that the computer-animated movies they are making are bad, but that they will never be as memorable as The Little Mermaid, and others such as Beauty and the Beast.  I even caught myself sheding a tear at the end of the movie; it's that good.Props to the various people who write the music.  Part of what made The Little Mermaid so wonderful was the colorful music that was sung throughout the movie.  It's sad that in this day and age, none of Disney's movies have any sort of music which truly capture the personality of each character.  One obvious example is ""Part of Your World"" which depicted Ariel's longing to venture out of her ""watery"" existence, and witness great things above the surface.  I have a newfound respect for Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (the brain-children of the music we all recognize and love); big props to them for making music that got stuck in my head.The only thing disappointing with this DVD is the fact that there is no hint of special features on it (which was also implied when looking on the back of the DVD case, and there was nothing listed).  I've enjoyed the serarate 'Special Features' discs that have come with various other classic Disney releases, but I was disappointed that it wasn't the case for this movie.  Hopefully Disney will release a special edition for this movie also.In any case, if you're looking for an animated movie with a great story, look no further because The Little Mermaid is the one you seek.(And yes it's a guy who's writing this review.  I'm man enough to write a review of a great animated classic)."	5.0	Stands the test of time...	2005-09-09	2	2	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2JTF5W7579V4L	musical &#60;3	looking back, it's hard for me to think of a time when disney didn't rain supremem in the world of family oriented animated features. but most will generally agree that the sixties, seventies, and eighties proved to be a dark time for the company. after walt's death, the company slid and the animation that it had been built on slided into what can only be, at best, called medeocraty. by 1989, all hope for the animation department rested on one motion picture, the little mermaid.the little mermaid would prove to be a phenominal movie that signified a rebirth in disney animation that would last well into the mid-to-late 1990's. but how did this one movie pull it all off? easy, mermaid features a brilliant blend of great animation, a great story, great performances, and oscar-winning music.the animation itself is rich and alive. the characters are all given great details that make them feel much more alive. the colors are bold and rich, not bland or monochromatic like in other disney efforts. the backgrounds are all amazingly brilliant and provide a great look at life under the sea from their colors as well combined with their startling detail. the combination of these elements provide an experience that is, for the first time in many years, magical.the use of another fairy tail seems to serve the company well yet again. many liberties are naturally taken to give the piece a happier ending than the original story. the additional characters and character development make for a great movie as well. from the zaniness of scuttle, to the delightful wickedness of ursula, these are some great characters that lead to a great picture.a lot of the greatness of those characters is owed to the performances, and wow. jodi benson as ariel may only be heard for the first half of the movie, but her moving performance is a definitive leading lady. pat carroll as ursula is perfect. her voice is nothing short of perfect. and no one can forget samuel e wright as the great jamaican crab. these performers all bring life that the animated movie needs to work.the music is absolutely stunning. i wont go into much detail, for that u can read my review of the soundtrack. but the great thing about all these songs is that they all progress the story brilliantly, just as a proper musical should. it was helpful to have a broadway team here to provide the six songs rather than a pop duo or performer provide one or two lifeless tracks.everything about this movie is fun, fresh, and everyhting a great family movie should be. the characters, performers, and songs all bring a life and freedom that is really great to see. there's a reason why this signaled a return to form for the walt disney company. a true timeless classic.	5.0	disney's rebirth	2006-07-27	10	10	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A146QCGOQPZLTG	Nicole	This movie amazes me every time that I see it. Some of the Disney cartoon movies that are being churned out today are okay but not as good as movies like The Little Mermaid. It is such a beautiful movie and so tastefully done. I truly believe it's a movie for the young and the young at heart. It's all about falling in love and doing anything for the person that you love even risking your own life. The songs really touch my heart, the characters are so funny, sweet and lovable from Flounder the dumb and sweet fish to Sebastian the funny and witty crab to Scuttle the absentminded and crazy seagull.  Ariel the mermaid kind of reminds me of what almost every young teenage girl is like, headstrong and just wanting to go out and follow her own dreams and having to grow up with a loving, but very overprotective and strict father and going against the schemes and plots of the evil Ursula but in the end after overcoming all the obstacles finally being with her true love forever. It is just a beautiful story and ever since I saw it when it first came out in the theatres with my mother it has grown on me and I have loved and cherished this movie ever since. The songs are everything from upbeat to romantic and the actors/actresses picked to do the voices for the characters are so talented and are just made for the parts. I fell in love with this movie and the characters in it in 1989 and am still in love with it today. The Little Mermaid: being transported from real life into the beautiful underworld of the ocean filled with mermaids/mermen, fish, and many more made me want to be &quot;part of that world&quot;	5.0	One of Disney's best!	2001-02-10	6	5	1

We played a Little Mermaid game trial on the Disney Website and my daughter loved doing anything that involved Ariel or Sebastian.  I already own the movie on VHS and thought it would be a good idea to get the DVD, especially since it also supposedly contains extras.  The extras are totally for adults who are interested in trivia.  There is NO game--not anything that even closely resembles a game. Though there is a section that says ""Games and Activities"", there are also NO activities.  This is a LIE.  What's in the area labeled games and activities is a video feature, a ""virtual ride"" on the Little Mermaid amusement park ride that was apparently planned but never created.  There is ""virtually no control"" over this supposed feature.  It is in no way a game or activity.The movie is the movie.  We like the movie.  I've now purchased two recent Disney releases which are supposed to be restored.  I don't see a difference.  I admit, I am not trying hard either.  I'm not a video elitist when it comes to equipment.  I'm an average buyer.I got free lithographs ordering this early from the Disney site, but they had signs of having been handled.  The delivery package had no marks, but the lithographs do.  There is a small crease in the same spot on all of them.What a disappointment!  I had thoughts that I might have put these in my daughter's bedroom somewhere, but with this flaw, I don't know.I don't think I'll be fooled by the next Disney package.  I have all the Disney full length animations on videotape from ""Snow White"" to ""Beauty and the Beast"".  I have several on DVD.  Of these more recent ""restored"" releases, I have two, this and ""Lady and the Tramp"".  I've been fooled twice.  Shame on me."	2.0	Of course the movie is fine...	2006-10-06	16	4	12

It was going to be one episode in a never finished new version of ""Fantasia""; finally, it's made available, by itself, in this Diamond Edition: truly worth watching.Both Blu-Ray and DVD have got cleaned-up transfers with rich colors and excellent sound that makes justice to some of Disney's most successful and charming musical numbers."	5.0	Classic animated movie, excellent transfer and bonus features	2014-03-28	0	0	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3TISHGXRLMTTV	Patrick Correa	I was wrong when I said Aladdin was my 2nd favorite Disney movie.  I must confess upon re-watching them back to back that while Aladdin was still one of the best, I didn&#8217;t enjoy the movie as much as this one (although for the TV shows, that&#8217;s another story).  It doesn&#8217;t surprise me that this was my first Disney movie, as I was born the year it came out.  As I have said before in a couple other reviews, I like just about anything with good mermaids in it, and until my mermaid TV show comes about, this is pretty much the pinnacle of mermaids in popular culture.  I have to admit, as much as I enjoyed it when I was younger, I enjoy it even more now since I read the original story.  With all due respect to the people who prefer the original, I hated it.  I was only 12 when I read it and it was incredibly depressing.  I was surprised when I learned that the Walt Disney version would have kept the original ending.  With all due respect to Walt, thank God they changed the ending!  If my sister & I had been exposed to it at such a young age, she would have been scarred for life & I would have cried my little eyes out.Like I said before, Beauty & The Beast is my favorite Disney movie, but this is definitely my second favorite now.  It&#8217;s as close to perfection as we can get.  The animation is great, the songs are awesome (the biggest failing of Aladdin for me was its soundtrack; it was definitely good but the only real standout for me was &#8220;Never Had A Fiend Like Me&#8221;) & the story & characters are memorable.  Ariel is, apart from Belle & maybe Jasmine (for her appearances in the TV show) my favorite Disney Princess.  The second to break the &#8220;helpless/useless princess&#8221; mold (after Princess Calla from the Gummi Bears) that previous princesses suffered from.  Eric is the first prince to actually have some personality.  Ursula is one of Disney&#8217;s best villains.  She really creeped me out when I was young.  All the other characters are great, except for Flounder.  He just didn&#8217;t really seem to do anything.  However, Sebastian & especially Scuttles (my favorite of the 2; the only good episode of the Little Mermaid show was the one with him in it) are 2 of the greatest sidekicks ever.  The former provides great musical numbers & the latter always cracks me up.  But the funniest part of this film will always be the whole &#8220;Les Poissons&#8221; scene, which has got to be one of the most hilarious scenes ever.  The Disney Renaissance was truly flourishing at this point, although personally I think it actually started a little earlier than most people think (specifically, with the Gummi Bears show which lasted 6 seasons & The Great Mouse Detective).  I can understand why people don&#8217;t like it or even prefer the original version of the story, but for me this is always enjoyable.	5.0	My first Disney movie, and my second favorite.	2014-01-16	0	0	0

For a more recent Disney flick, I consider this to be one of the best. The characters are well thought out, the story line is great, and the songs original. This is a very good movie that your kids will ask to watch over and over, and adult fans of Disney will love as well.	5.0	Excellent Movie	2007-01-09	0	0	0

If you have the old DVD,Laserdisc, or VHS tape you have the uncensored version.Those who objected to the bent knee of the minister when Eric and Vanessa walked down the aisle to wed can rest easily knowing that even if it wasn't supposed to represent an erect version of a body part, no one will make that mistake again.

After many years of routine, passionless films, this marked a return to the unabashedly musical and emotional roots of the great Disney animated films of the the past combined now with the modern Broadway musical tradition.The story is simple and sweet, underpinned by masterful songs from the great Alan Menken and Howard Ashman.

I don't think there's ever been anything that appealed to me as much as The Little Mermaid has. I find it hard to write a review and find the right words to describe this movie. The Little Mermaid sparked something deep down in my soul a long time ago. It reminds you of your dreams and your hopes. It's pure magic! This movie touched so many people over the years and it's still waiting for another generation to do the same. Today or Tomorrow, even a hundred years from now this will remain one of Disney's greatest.	5.0	Pure Magic	2003-02-07	4	3	1

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3VHUQ85RH0BC3	"Raj ""rajivsreviews"""	This has been a favorite movie of mine since my childhood. It is the first Disney movie that I remember watching over and over again, during the weekends when I had nothing else to do. Recently, I decided to watch the movie again, and it still has that same effect on me after all these years.The story centers on a mermaid living under the sea in the Kingdom of Atlantica named Ariel. She is the youngest daughter of King Triton, and has a fascination for the human world above the sea. She collects various antiques with her friend Flounder, and frequently goes above sea level to talk to Skuttle (a seagull who tells her about humans), even though her father forbids her from doing so. Soon, her falls in love with Prince Eric, a human, but when her father discovers this, he makes it clear that she will never be allowed to meet the human. Ariel is willing to do anything to meet Eric, even if it means wandering off to the evil Sea witch, Ursula to become a human.Ron Clements and John Musker, the directors of this movie and also other Disney classics like Aladdin and Hercules, beautifully portray the story of Ariel in `The Little Mermaid'. The cast for providing voices to the characters also did a good job. Jodi Benson (who gives voices for many characters in Disney) did very well for the voice of Ariel, as did Samuel Wright for Sebastian along with Pat Carroll for the voice for Ursula. However, most of the credit goes to Alan Menken for composing a wonderful score to the movie, and teaming up with the late Howard Ashman to create some catchy and moving songs, that add well to the story. From listening to the songs in the movie, it is not surprising that this one the Academy Award for Best Score and also and Award for Best Song `Under the Sea'.The only disappointing feature is the video presentation on this DVD. Some of the scenes still appear a little grainy and blurry. If you want a lot of features, I suggest you want till the Platinum series of this edition releases, consisting with a 2-disk set, filled with features is compared to this edition.This is one of the best movies that Disney has created, and stands on top of the list along with `Beauty and the Beast' and `Aladdin'. This is a true masterpiece which can be enjoyed by all ages.	5.0	A Disney masterpiece!	2004-09-11	0	0	0
0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A15RYJP7YHCEF7	Ralph Paulsen	Love what Disney has done with the Little Mermaid tale, in particular the change to a happily ever after ending (in the original she turns to foam, at least that's what I remember) that being said, the transfer to DVD is not up to Disneys high standards, not really bad just not as good as one has come to expect from Disney, never the less I highly recommend getting this disc, hopefully Disney will come out with a BLU-RAY edition, till then this isn't bad, enjoy the story and artistry of the animators, a little film grain doesn't really distract from ones enjoyment	4.0	One of Disney's best	2011-01-20	0	0	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3PWPNZVMNX3PA	rareoopdvds	"...I bought the new ""Masterpiece"" edition as well as the newly digitized DVD version. Upon close inspection of the copies, I noticed not only a cover difference, but footage in the new one is altered. That is to say, the DVD and Masterpiece are shortened. Towards the end of the film, where Eric is about the be married to Ursala, there is the seemingly innocuous priest, who, while giving a sermon, is wagging his ""phallus"" up and down. Yes, you will see that in the Classics edition, but you will be cut short if you have the DVD or Masterpiece edition....As far as Little Mermaid is concerned, I hail it as one of their masterpieces because it is the last Disney cartoon to be fully hand-drawn as well as just a great movie unto itself. The three stars are towards the Masterpiece edition of the movie, and not the Classics edition. I may be making a fuss over a small issue, and it may even seem to others right for Disney to make the change, however, I just feel Disney should not be held responsible... If Disney wanted that little bit of humor in the film, then they should leave it in there."	3.0	So Whats the Big Idea?	2002-06-03	18	6	12

I had seen Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, but neither caught my attention.  Maybe it was my age, maybe my increased curiosity with water and mermaids.  I received my first video copy in high school, and I wore it out by my freshman year in college.  Shortly after another copy magically found it's way into my collection, which does not run very smoothly any more, but doesn't need to because I now have yet another copy.Every time I see The Little Mermaid, I am recaptured by the innocence and curiosity of Ariel.  I identify with her, as I think most young girls do, and I find her attempts at achieving independence from her father familiar.The animation was a giant step for Disney, the quality is much better than their past productions.

Wright (""Sebastian""), Buddy Hackett (""Scuttle"") and Pat Carroll (""Ursula"") are, without a doubt, the best ever heard in a Disney film.  Able-bodied vocal support is given by the always-dependable Rene Auberjoinois as a set-upon French chef.The songs (""Under the Sea"", ""Part of Your World"", ""Poor Unfortunate Soul"", ""Kiss the Girl"") are Broadway-worthy.It's a shame that the film is not in circulation at the moment.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	AFV2584U13XP3	Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!)	There are few movies especially Disney movies that I will admit to ever watching, but this movie is one of the few I'm not embarrassed to admit watching or having a deep love for.  This is one of the few animated Disney movies of the late 80's and early 90's that I feel were the best that Disney ever made(I'm not counting the early movies like Snow White or Peter Pan those are beyond time immortal) movies like Aladin, Beauty and The Beast, and The Lion King.  I won't really mention the other two Little mermaid movies as while I'm not saying there bad I just dislike when movie companies feel the need to franchise a movie so much to the point it starts to loose its entertainment quality.  I still remember when this majestic movie first came out and finally after so many years the Disney Corporation has finally given this great time honored film the quality dvd format to put it on.  So if you're like me and want something to renew the love you have of the what made the Disney movies great here's one of the great classic collections to get for home collection library...Update 09-22-2011I just want to warn parents that if your kids want the book version of the little mermaid get the Disney one, while Hans Christian Andersen's book was a memorable book it was far from the happy fairy tale ending we got with the Disney version and many kids will probably be disenchanted after reading or being read the Andersen's original version of this story...	5.0	A Great Disney Movie That Brings The Fond Memories Of Bygone Years	2009-07-09	1	1	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2A880Z33IHB1Z	Richard J. Andrews Jr.	I'm one of the late customers to get a 3D television. So when I purchased a new Television I picked this up right away. This is the first 3D Disney Movie that I've seen and I loved it so much I got all the available ones so far. This was to test to see if I liked it and it was beautiful. The 3D is crisp, and it's just like watching a new movie. You'll see things you never noticed, and you'll be amazed at how beautiful the movie is. It's worth the repurchase in my opinion. Hopefully 3D isn't dying out like all the signs are pointing to. I'm sold on it now. I think it will pick up again. I just think it came out at  a wrong time when everyone just bought a HD television.There is very little they have changed in the movie itself. They took out some flaws, so if your one of those that hate when they take out things(even if it's for the better) you'll be quick to forgive it. It isn't anything as drastic as the ET scene where they removed the guns and replaced them with radios.Once again, you won't be disappointed with this 3D version. I'm even going to repurchase some of the newer ones that I got that wasn't in 3D, since I didn't have the TV at the time. Anyway, just get it already!	5.0	3D Beauty	2013-11-10	3	3	0

I was lucky to catch this on sale during the Christmas season and snagged it for only $19, but seeing it almost everywhere for a average of $30 made me ill.

Sadly I loaned my copy to a favorite teacher of mine and never got it back, and of course it was out of print for a gazillion years.  Now it is back in print, and my sister gave it to me for Christmas.  Based on the Hans Christian Andersen folktale and written by Howard Ashman and Allan Menken LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, this story is about a 16 year old mermaid name Ariel, who doesn't like living under the sea.  Much to the chagrin of ther father King Triton, she falls in love with a human Prince Eric, and gets the sea witch Ursala to put a spell on her.  Well, Ursala tries to marry Eric.  Will Ariel's friends be able to stop the wedding?  Or will Ursala succeed in marrying the love of Ariel's life?

It had been years since Disney had given us anything of note from their animation department. Based on the Hans Christian Anderson classic, ""The Little Mermaid"" brought large audiences back to the type of Disney tradition millions had grown-up on.With characters like Sebastian the crab, the evil witch Ursula, king Triton and Prince Eric, great Disney family storytelling was back on track. But Ariel ""the Little Mermaid"" with voice beautifully provided by Jodi Benson, truly is the star of this warmly touching cinematic delight. You truly feel for her, and her deep longing to become human. Such a lovable tale for all ages, which can even be a little frightening for very small children; especially towards the end when evil Ursula seems to have conquered all of the sea kingdom and everyone of its inhabitants. But most will be pleased with the extremely happy ending. Outstanding Howard Ashman and Alan Menken score."	5.0	The Revival of Classic Disney Animation	2008-04-16	2	2	0
0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A4FX5YCJA630V	"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya"""	"The movie that reinvigorated the Disney franchise and set off the start of its Silver Age, ""The Little Mermaid"" has finally been properly restored and distributed in a DVD that's packed with lots of juicy extras.In creating ""The Little Mermaid"", the Disney Company tinkered a little with the traditional Hans Christian Anderson story - actually, tinkered quite a lot. The original fairytale ends with the nameless mermaid's tragic and selfless death: after she sacrifices all in order to be with the man she loves, she gives it all up so that he might live happily with his human love. Taking this basic premise of a water-bound mermaid who falls in love with a land-dweller, Disney makes the ending considerably more upbeat, packs it full of catchy songs, and throws in a few animal sidekicks for good measure. Purists of any work of literature that Disney have adapted (whether it be Chinese legend, French novels about hunchbacks, Native American history or the library of children's literature that Disney has delved into for inspiration) have always been somewhat scornful of the changes made in the name of the Disney brand-name, and in many cases I can see their point.But ""The Little Mermaid"" is based on a fairytale, albeit one that was born from one man's head as opposed to the collective minds of human culture. But this being the case, the story can get away more easily with changes to the story, without loosing the potency of its core themes and ideas. In particular, the filmmakers struck gold in their characterisation of the Little Mermaid herself; by making her a vivacious red-headed called Ariel, they unknowingly set the standard for animated heroines forever afterwards (the fact that the character is silent for much of the movie and still remains entirely `alive' is a testimony to both the animation and the characterisation). Ariel dreams of the mystery and excitement of the human world, much to the concern of her father King Triton and his valet, the Caribbean crab Sebasation. But since when have teenage girls ever taken notice of stodgy authority figures? Together with her best friend Flounder, Ariel secretly explores sunken ships, taking her finds to the scatterbrained seagull Scuttle for analysis.But when she saves the life of Prince Eric in a storm, a sinister outcast makes her move upon the hapless young girl. Ursula the Sea-Witch offers to turn Ariel into a human for three days, during which she must get Eric to kiss her should she want to remain with him on land always. The price is her voice, and the penalty should she fail is a lifetime of misery as one of Ursula's grotesque little plants. The clock is ticking, and there is more than just Ariel's future at stake...The restoration of ""The Little Mermaid"" demonstrates just how beautiful the movie is, and the painstaking work that went into each detail, right down to the last bubble. The pacing is perfect (neither too speedy nor dragging along), the characters are bright and lovable, and the story is a classic love/adventure/coming-of-age/fantasy story with just enough bittersweetness at Ariel's eventual parting from her family and friends in the ocean to leave a lump in your throat. And don't get me started on the songs: from the reggae ""Kiss the Girl"" sung by an array of aquatic animals that are desperately urging Eric to kiss Ariel (it always has me on the edge of my seat), to Ursula's villainous ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" which is so insistent and persuasive in convincing Ariel to accept Ursula's bargain that her rather stupid decision to sign away her freedom becomes completely understandable (heck, by the end of it *you'll* be ready to sign), and of course the award-winning ""Under the Sea"", which will get stuck in your head for days.It isn't entirely perfect of course; the makers never did quite reconcile Ariel's youthful fancies with reality, leaving a rather one-sided view of the dual worlds of sea and land. In her song ""Part of Your World"", Ariel wistfully dreams about land, imagining it to be a paradise where humans ""never reprimand their daughters"" and that everyone is happy and fulfilled in their extraordinary lives on dry land. For those of us living on land, we know the reality is quite different -  and it is a strange omission in the storytelling that Ariel never seems to learn this. Instead, she is treated with nothing but kindness and love once she's out of the water, and never experiences the darker side of life on earth. In other words, Ariel is completely vindicated, King Triton is proved totally wrong, and although letting your children go is a lesson every parent must learn, Ariel never really learns the equally important idea that sometimes parents can be right.But this is a sin of omission as opposed to commission, and the rest of the film is as close to storytelling perfection as any film could ever be (and was only topped by Disney's next offering ""Beauty and the Beast""). As well as the movie there are plenty of special features; including several deleted scenes (mostly extended songs and some background information - such as the reason behind why Ursula was banished from Triton's kingdom), a virtual ride of a Little Mermaid-themed attraction at Disneyland that was designed but never built, a featurette on Hans Christian Anderson and his original fairytale (well done Disney, always acknowledge your sources!) and a pop version of ""Kiss the Girl"" as sung by Ashley Tisdale(who probably had a lot of sugar before this particular performance). I hate to say it, but it's actually quite catchy. Best of all though is a short-film based on Hans Christian Anderson's ""The Little Match-girl"". Much like a segment of ""Fantasia"", it has no dialogue, only music and animation, and it was apparently made entirely for the release of this DVD. It's a lovely treat, especially since 2-D animation is so rare these days.Great movie, great DVD, great enjoyment."	5.0	"""What Would I Give to Live Where You Are?"""	2006-12-27	3	2	1

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2J5HVQOHU4FG7	"Robert Mason ""Dr Robert"""	Walt Disney was one of the few undisputed giants of popular culture, along with those amazing Brits Charlie Chaplin and John Lennon. His presided over the creation of 6 or so cartoon movies I regard as immortal (Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Sleeping Beauty, Lady and the Tramp and The Jungle Book is my list, not forgetting Mary Poppins, which isn't a cartoon). And then he died and the Disney studio slumped into mediocrity. They lived off the legacy he created.And then this film came along and it was so completely wonderful, I remember taking my family to see it and, for the first time since that cursed Star Wars created the endless sequence of end credits, I sat through all the credits to listen to the music again.It was immediately obvious that a new genius of the order of Walt Disney had come along, because here was a film that almost stood abreast of his greatest creation Pinocchio, that most completely wonderful movie.. What wasn't obvious was that the wonderful Howard Ashman was already then dieing, would barely limp through his next movie Beauty and the Beast, and would only get around to composing half of the libretto for Aladdin before giving up the ghost. But what a legacy he left behind!And how great of the Disney studio that they keep on honouring him, with the fond recollections in the extra features of their disks (and how very opposite the treatment Warner Brothers gave him in their recent remastering of his only other movie, Little Shop of Horrors, for which he isn't even mentioned once in the endless end credits even though he wrote all the lyrics and the screenplay).And this is the best of the lot because, one day during the development of The Little Mermaid, he gave the Disney team a lecture on the nature and structure of great musicals that feature female leads - an archetypal analysis. And here, for the first time, are extracts of that filmed lecture, plus people remembering it and commenting on it and how it influenced their future thinking. It is such a treasure for those who appreciate the really creative few among us, who just know things.My only complaint is that they did not present the lecture in full. Hint, Disney: Criterion would have done this.The film, like Pinocchio, has a profound moral core yet is a joy to watch. It is perfect in its structure without ever being wearisome - entirely predictable in every way yet a delight to see unfold.Indeed, this film and the lecture stand at the opposite end of the spectrum to the recently released and hugely over-rated Frozen, which, no matter how beautifully made and wonderful visually, is structurally flawed, dated, sexist and unpleasant in its core. Releasing Frozen almost at the same time as the Ashman lecture is curious indeed, because Disney could have followed his advice, particularly in regards to the main song Let It Go, and would have had a much better movie.	5.0	A great movie	2014-04-01	0	0	0

Little meek Ariel gives up her VOICE to get the man. Not too subtle, is it? The interesting woman in the movie - that wicked old wet witch - is the smart, intelligent, proactive and powerful woman. Why can't Disney offer women role models who are powerful, smart and GOOD?Powerful women are scary so they must be EVIL and seek to harm and diminish and denigrate other women. So much for sisterhood. It's very disappointing that in the 21st Century, we're still peddling this extremely negative message to little girls.And what must Ariel give up in order to have her man? Let's see...her voice, her talent, her home, her dreams, but alas, it's all worth it. Or so we're led to believe. Yuck.I am profoundly disappointed that these type of movies are still popular amongst parents and children alike.	1.0	Perfect...for training little girls to be passive and powerless	2007-04-14	82	22	60

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1G53IVK74DLQG	Roy	The Little Mermaid is arguably one of Disney's alltime greatest achievements. The music is amazing and the songs are the most fun Disney has ever brought. The animation, ahh, the revived animation is one of The  Little Mermaid strongest points. It's amazing and colorful. The fact that  it was painted with hand just makes it more cherished and precious. The  characters are memorable and Ariel and Sebastian and the rest of the cast  are Disney's all-time beloved characters. The story is famous and beloved  and why, it's no wonder the movie turned out to be the most successful one  up to 1991's also beautiful Beauty and the Beast.	5.0	This one is the Best	2000-02-05	0	0	0
0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	AM2PV53UX1JEQ	R. Penola	After years of disappointing Disney animated movies, along came the songwriting team of the late Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who knew how to write big, bold commercial scores that retain an intimacy and a true sense  of character.  The Little Mermaid, their first feature for Disney, is  spectacular on every level: it features a wonderful variation on the old  fairy tale, and a cast of warmly appealing characters in real predicaments  of the heart and soul.  The animation swirls around you and is magically  transporting -- you will be enveloped in the worlds both beneath and above  the sea.  And of course the musical score fairly bursts at the seams.  Ariel and Prince Eric are truly sexy cartoons -- you will be amazed at how  they work their magic spell on you and your family.	5.0	DISNEY'S RENAISSANCE	1999-12-21	2	1	1

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1Y6NRMGPR2TBO	"R. Smit ""Mem & Pep"""	It's perhaps unfair to judge Disney's &#34;Little Mermaid&#34; against Studio Ghibli's &#34;Ponyo,&#34; especially considering the influence the former had on the latter, but there you have it: The world has moved on, and &#34;Ponyo&#34; is the better movie not only for its more charming animation style and creative story alterations, but for its change in attitude toward women and girls.While I did enjoy the nostalgia of this &#34;Little Mermaid,&#34; I cringed throughout watching it now, in 2013, as a progressive parent and educator. Ariel's &#34;true love&#34; boy crush (and for that matter, Eric's &#34;true love&#34; girl crush)? Not a great message to children. Destiny by makeover? Nope. Daddy issues? Double nope. Marriage at the tender age of 16? Nopity nope. The fatphobic jokes, the uglier and brassier and older sisters, the &#34;duke of soul&#34; and the &#34;blackfish&#34; (?!?!), the sexualization of a teenager (and not in a self-possessed sex-positive way, either, but in a male gazey way &#8212;honestly, I think Ariel would be less sexualized *without* the shell bra)? Stop, already.But most of all, I was disturbed by the choice to retain Hans Christian Andersen's plot device that makes this little mermaid voiceless &#8212; and without following it through to Andersen's moral. Where Andersen uses voicelessness to tell a cautionary tale about being true to yourself, to warn against changing for a fickle man, Disney uses voicelessness to tell us that makeovers work (at least until sea witches interfere), and HAPPY ENDINGS DO COME TRUE. Considering this, considering that Disney took many other liberties with the plot, considering that Studio Ghibli's &#34;Ponyo&#34; kept her voice (and what a voice!) in its better, looser adaptation, I'm not about to let Disney off the hook for this messaging. Taking a young woman's voice away from her &#8212; and then requiring that she communicate with her body &#8212; is a powerfully disempowering message to send to girls. Ursula's advice to Ariel, in her big show tune number, is essentially a G-rated (dare I say &#34;Disneyfied&#34;?), &#34;shut up and put out.&#34; Just how screwed up is that for a cartoon aimed at the 4-10 set??On the bright side, the music is still fun, and I shocked my kids by singing along to many of the songs (equally shocking myself by remembering the lyrics at all!). The voice acting is pleasantly plucky. The animation isn't too bad, though it doesn't hold up as well as my memory had it. On a technical level it is still a good film, just aged.	3.0	A progressive parent's different perspective on this Disney classic	2013-12-06	8	1	7

Great music, great story, humor, this movie has it all. Snatch it up before it is no longer available!The DVD features on this edition of The Little Mermaid are wonderful! The deleted scenes are roughly animated, but are delightful. Each is introduced by the co-writers/co-directors, and the missing scenes even provide you with information about the story never before known (did you know that the Ursula is King Triton's SISTER?!) The making of featurrette is a 45-minute extraveganza that goes into all the details you ever wanted to know about the development, creation, and even ramifications of the film. And did you know that Disney at one time was developing a Little Mermaid theme park attraction ride? This DVD allows you to not only learn about the ride and it's development, but also to take a virtual ride on the attraction itself - as it would have been if it had ever been realized. The 10-minute Disneypedia is in my opinion the most valuable feature on the entire DVD (besides the film itself, of course). It combines animation with live footage of undersea creatures. It is especially wonderful for children because it not only entertains, it EDUCATES! And that is the most wonderful thing of all!This is a gem of a DVD...

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A37DZX4F5RU2PQ	Sarita Dutta	Disney's 28th animated feature brims with the richness of imagination and the magic of an outstanding musical score. This Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, though not quite true to the original, is uniquely retold through enchanting Disney animation. At a time when animation was dying a slow death, a beautiful mermaid with a soulful voice made her appearance on the silver screen and won the heart of millions.Sixteen-year old Ariel dreams of life on the land, although her father, the sea-king Triton does not approve of the human race, branding them as `savage harpooning fish-eaters'. However as fate would have it, Ariel catches her first glimpse of the very handsome prince Eric and falls devotedly in love with him after saving his life during a raging sea storm. Her obsessive yet true love compels her to sell her voice to the sea-witch Ursula for three days as a human, within which Eric has to kiss her lips in `the kiss of true love'.The animation is rich in color and texture. Incomplete cels are hardly noticeable. The backgrounds are lush and vivid and the character sketching blends a traditional style with modern details. Ariel is still the prettiest Disney heroine; her facial expressions beautifully conveying her emotions. She is Glenn Keane's best creation till date. Eric is the bland Disney hunk; his drop-dead gorgeous looks and serious expressions sobered by boyish grins easily make him the most favorite Disney heartthrob (thanks to Mark Henn). Andreas Deja, well known for villains like Scar (from The Lion King) and Jafar (from Aladdin), was the supervising animator for Triton and Duncan Marjoribanks does an excellent job of portraying the character of Sebastian.The music, which was one of the last collaborative efforts of Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman, is profoundly magnificent. The Oscar-winning score is rich in musical and orchestral beauty, `The Jig' and `The Storm' being the most memorable sequences. Menken's enchanting and emotional score provides a new dimension to the movie. It has a certain magic to it that I find absent in his later scores (like Aladdin and more recently, Hercules). The songs, which vary from the haunting `Part Of Your World' to the Caribbean styled `Kiss The Girl', are wonderfully composed. `Under The Sea' is an excellent number which won the Oscar as the best song of 1989.The voice talent is very praiseworthy and unlike later animation movies, it does not include a host of celebrities. Jodi Benson simply stands out as Ariel and her vocal performances will move you.  Pat Carroll shows her talent as the villainous Ursula. Christopher Daniel Barnes' deep yet boyish voice suits Prince Eric perfect. Kenneth Mars and Jason Marin will be well loved in their roles as King Triton and Flounder. The best role in the movie is that of Samuel E. Wright, who renders an outstanding performance as the voice of Sebastian.All in all, a true classic that offers something for the entire family. Filled with crisp fun and entertainment, the movie highlights the value and meaning of true love and sacrifice, conveying its emotional meaning in a marvelous way. It truly touches your heart, the sad parts making you cry and the comical parts making you laugh.The DVD however does not do justice to this masterpiece. The non-anamorphic transfer is grainy and non-satisfactory. The colors look bright (specially the red), but the dark sequences of the film suffer from pixelisation and non-restoration.  The audio (Dolby Digital 5.1) is good, though I feel that the DD mix does not properly highlight the score or make adequate use of the rear sound. Furthermore, there is no special feature whatsoever on the Disc. I strongly criticize Disney for presenting such a spectacular movie in such an artless manner. This movie holds a very special place in my heart and I am eagerly waiting for the October 2008 platinum re-release of the DVD, which, I hope like the recent two-Disc Disney releases, will provide the quality I yearn for.	5.0	A CONTEMPORARY CLASSIC OFFERING SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE	2003-07-31	0	0	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	ARAS5VERQ8BH2	Scott Baret	I saw this movie in the theater when I was really young clear back in 1989. It was only the second time I had been to the movies. I thought it was so good that I got it on VHS the following year.It's a tale that's great for young and old alike. It's also a movie that everyone has seen, at least in my circle of friends. The soundtrack is good, the animation is wonderfully done, and even a guy in the 18-21 range (myself included) can get a good laugh or two out of it.This is a film the current generation of teens will wind up passing on to their children ten years from now. Destined to go down next to Snow White and Bambi as a Disney masterpiece, Little Mermaid comes highly recommended for anyone with young children (or anyone who is either young at heart or has a sudden feeling of nostalgia).	5.0	Still good after all these years	2005-01-02	6	5	1

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A21IQK595UHIXH	sd	I love this movie sooooo very much! I ordered it because it was finally on sale (from the usual 30 dollars it normally costs) and I couldn't pass up the opportunity. I had read the story before and knew I really wanted to watch it. After getting it, I immediately watched it the same day, and I am 100% satisfied with the quality of the product, the animation is very well done, the special deleted scenes are fun to watch (although I'm glad they were left out of the movie) and the sound quality is amazing as well! But there are two things I'm not happy with: first of all, it took too long to ship, and the tracking status wasn't regularly updated. Second, since this is a DVD+ Digital Copy combo, you would think they would at least tell you if the digital copy code was old or not, because for some reason, they do expire and that's what happened in my case. So, to sum up, the quality of the movie is amazing and definitely worth the price, but the expired code and the delayed shipment, a bit of a downer.	5.0	Amazing Time And Time Again!	2014-04-28	0	0	0

As far as the picture quality goes, I was very impressed.  I would give the picture quality a B+ to A-.  The 3D was very nice and dimensional and in my opinion added to the movie.  There were a few instances where, there was lots of motion on the screen and in those couple of instances, the 3D was distracting.  The colors were vibrant and and the picture was very clean.I already own the Little Mermaid on DVD so the 3D version was the enticement I needed to buy it on blue ray.	5.0	Very Nice Blu-Ray Conversion.	2013-10-04	5	5	0

We're lucky to catch The Little Mermaid during its designated stint out of the ""Disney Vault"". To think that she could have otherwise been deprived by Disney itself from seeing it at her perfect age is criminal.The Little Mermaid story is familiar enough to any parent, so I won't go on about that.I will say that if you indeed do have a little princess that would like to be able to see some of the other Disney princess classics now, it's nice to live in a time when Disney's strange behavior of taking their classics off the market can be circumvented by great Internet marketers like Amazon. I was able to buy some of the other 5 Star Disney Princess classics that are currently ""back in the Disney Vault"" for my young princess through a few of Amazon's third-party sellers. And without that opportunity, my little princess may have outgrown Snow White, Beauty and the Beast & Sleeping Beauty by the time Disney released them again.So along with your Little Mermaid Amazon purchase, consider taking advantage of purchasing any of the other ""off-the-market"" Disney princess classics now via one of this site's resellers if you have a little princess of your own that might not appreciate them as much when Disney decides that it's time.And indeed, you will enjoy all of the Princess classics as thoroughly as your young one.Side Note on Resellers: Beware of exorbitant reseller prices; renting may be a better option if available. Also beware of REGION 2 resales; Region 2 DVDs will not play in most US DVD players. Look for Region 1 US Amazon resellers."	5.0	For Your Princess	2006-10-03	1	1	0

Knew all the songs and still do. I'm sure I will know them all my life.  I do have a soft spot for ""Dumbo"" and ""Robin Hood,"" but in my lifetime this is the best Disney movie ever made. And since Disney isn't making any more animated movies this may well be the last good Disney movie ever. Sorry all you Lion King and Beauty/Beast fans, they just didn't do it for me.  It's sad to witness an end to an era of creative genius but I'm glad they decided to close their animation offices rather than keep putting out things like Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. I haven't seen any of the video sequels, thank god.  Oh, and by the way, when I talk about the Disney movies made in my lifetime, I'm not counting Pixar, which I think makes great films. Unfortunately, it seems like they've left the cartoon musical behind too.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3KQQY9BGBWI0W	StacyG	I remember watching this movie many, many years ago. I loved it, and bought it for my two year old daughter in the hopes she would love it too. The story is fun and somewhat easy for her to follow. She doesn't understand everything about it yet, but she got the gist fairly quickly. The concept of a mermaid princess is interesting to her, since the other princesses she adores are land lubbers. Ariel, the mermaid, is her favorite character in this movie, but she was enthralled with Sebastian, the crab ordered by King Triton (ariel's dad) to watch over Ariel, and Flounder, who is Ariel's best friend. Ariel is intrigued by what goes on above water, and longs to be human. Ursula, a sea witch, tricks Ariel into becoming human after Ariel falls in love with a prince she saved when his ship wrecked. This movie is filled with great scenes, great characters, and great music! It's a wonderful animated film and is suitable for all ages.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	AT07UZQQR7ZEH	"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov..."	"I watched Disney's animated THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989) in one nasty, angry mood.  Within twenty minutes, I was feeling happy, caught in the spell of a strong story, gorgeous animation, and lively Oscar-winning songs.  The magic of Disney for kids of all ages permeates this story of Ariel, the likeable mermaid who falls in love with a human.  If she can go without her lovely voice for three days and still get the handsome prince to kiss her, she is a human for life.  The catch is that she can never again see her aquatic friends, like her king father and Sebastian the hilarious crab comic relief who almost gets eaten!  The central villainess is one of my all-time favorites, Ursula the sea witch, evil enough for adults and not too scary for kids.  She has stolen Ariel's lilting voice.  The story is taken from Hans Christian Andersen, but with a downbeat ending radically rethought in Disney fashion.  But I have a hunch the Andersen literary circle would approve of  the changes in making this a wonderful family film.  The voice work is perfection, including Jodi Benson as Ariel and Pat Carroll as Ursula.  Alan Menken and Howard Ashman collaborated on the songs; ""Under the Sea"" won a deserved Oscar, but I like ""Part of Your World"" and the hilarious ""Kiss the Girl"" also.The new double-disk DVD of THE LITTLE MERMAID is an absolute must-own, and not just for families with children.  If you are a child at heart, like me, you will treasure it.  And Disney Studios has restored the heck out of it--the colors are gorgeous, the image clarity is flawless, and the remastered soundtrack does justice to the music.  The 83 minute movie is on disk one, at its correct 1.78 moderate wide-screen aspect ratio, along with an audio commentary, should you decide (I did not) to listen to the co-writers and co-directors talk about the movie.  (They do enough of that on disk two.)  Also on disk one are a trailer for LITTLE MERMAID III (straight to video, probably a wise business decision) and a ""Kiss the Girl"" music video.  There is also a feature that lets you go to a particular song, a popular feature on a movie with these songs and an Oscar-winning music score.Disk two is mammoth, a good three hours.  I went to bed at midnight with the whole games section untouched.  There are 45 minutes of deleted scenes with commentary on what we are watching and why they were cut out.  There is another 45 minutes that goes behind the scenes at Disney Studios in 1989 at a time of great business upheaval to create the mood that this happy and romantic film was made under.  We also get a nine minute segment on animated special effects, like sea storms.  Disney was apparently thinking of doing THE LITTLE MERMAID back in 1941, but changed his mind and thankfully made DUMBO instead.  Or was it PINOCCHIO?  THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL is a lovely and sad animated short adaptation of another Andersen story, an exquisite bonus.  There are also LITTLE MERMAID art galleries and the original theatrical trailer.I still have Games and Activities to do, so I am not sure what to expect.  I gather that Disney was going to do a LITTLE MERMAID ride at Disneyland or Disney World, but changed their minds.  There is something called ""UNDER THE SEA: A Virtual Ride"" and a live-action segment on life under the sea.  It's an incredible two-disk DVD, and I have a hunch it belongs in every household.  Maybe even two copies--Disney is threatening to put this title back in the vaults for seven more years, and your kids may wear out one copy before seven years is up.  THE LITTLE MERMAID is not quite a Walt Disney immortal animated classic for me, but give it another decade and it might be.  For the time being, it is a fabulous way to spend a long evening with your kids.  Or even alone in a night bedroom."	4.0	Wonderful and romantic Disney animation	2006-10-22	7	6	1

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1C9GCHR99WX3F	Stephen Verhaeren	"In 1989, Disney made a comeback ater having failures for about 10 years, and they returned to make fairy tales with the Little Mermaid, it might be 2 bad Disney can't make them like this anymore, the more recent movies like Lilo & Stitch, The Emperor's New Groove, Piglet's Big Movie, and Brother Bear are all cute films, but they might not live up to the classics like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, and the Little Mermaid. When this movie first came out on dvd, I could buy it on dvd since there was no dvd player in the house, and it was already out of stock by the time dvds first enter in my house, so last week I brought a copy of the film of the marketplace, even though I was quite disappointed in getting a hard cover copy of ""How I changed my life"". As the movie opens, there is a concert in the kingdom of King Triton (Kenneth Mars), featureing all of his daughters including the youngest Ariel (Jodie Benson), who is not present at the concert, who is off visiting a boat with her sidekick Flounder (Jason Marin), and finds a couple of human stuff, and adds it to her collection, while she has forgotten about the concert. But when she remains she rushes home, and is in trouble with her father, and tells her that he doesn't want to hear of her going to thee surface again. But once again she disobys her father, and goes off after seeig fireworks, and lays eyes on Price Eric (Christopher Daniel Barnes). And she falls in love with him, and she saves his life when a strom hits, and brings him to land. But when a crab named Sebastian (Samuel E. Wright) mistaken tells King Triton, he oderes her not to see her new human freind again, and destroys all her treasures including a new statue that was given to her from Flounder a few seconds before, which leads her into meeting Ursula (Pat Caroll) who worsk a deal, that if she trade her voice, and her fins, she will make a portion that will maek a human foe 3 days, and she will have to get Prince Eric to kiss her, to have her remain a human by sunset of the 3rd day."	5.0	Begining of the 9's great Disney animation area	2004-11-23	1	1	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1TB9FVJA7STYR	superchunkz00	"I've recently started buying all the classic Disney titles for my movie collection at home.  Now, I hadn't seen the Little  Mermaid since I was maybe 7 or 8(I'm 29 now).  After watching it 3 times the first week, all I have to say is WOW.  Everything about the movie is perfect.Now, everyone knows how the STORY goes so I don't need to talk about it, but even as an adult you can't help but root for the spirited Ariel who wants so bad to be part of a world that she doesn't belong to.  She's wide-eyed, earnest and genuine, but she doesn't wait for things to happen to her, she's proactive.  She's also got a great supporting cast in Sebastian, Flounder, the kooky Scuttle, and a formidable villain in Ursulla.  The MUSIC, actually resonates with me more now than when I was a kid.  Disney really had something special in Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. The melodies are great and catchy, the lyrics are effortless, have great deal of wit to them and they advance the story quite well.  I would even argue that Disney hasn't had a musical team that strong since(Alan Menken would go on to have more collaborators after Howard Ashman's passing but IMO nothing can top the songs they did for Mermaid, Beauty and Aladdin).  Also, this doesn't get mentioned as often as it should but this movie has a great deal of humor in it too(if I ever meet a woman who brushes her hair with a fork on our first date, I'd probably marry her lol)!The movie has been fully restored and looks great, there's a good deal of bonus features including deleted scenes, a wonderful ""making of"" documentary, the truth behind the story, a great short video ""the little match girl"" which will probably bring tears to your eyes, and much more.Do yourself a favor and get this wonderful movie, which single-handedly saved Disney Animation, brought back the animated musical and started the 2nd Disney renaissance of the late 80's to the late 90's."	5.0	modern classic	2012-05-19	2	1	1

The usual label was missing sealing the outside of the case and the usual Disney info from the inside of the case wss missing, including the Disney code for Disney bonus materials.  Also the disc artwork looked different from our previous Little Mermaid DVD that got stuck in a DVD player.  The video also gets stuck in the very beginning every time we play the movie and then jumps during the Kiss the Girl scene and then the audio doesn't match the video.  I'm very disappointed that this was represented as new, sealed DVD and it was a copy.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2CZR46KVZLWDT	Suzie	I was born in 1987, making me two years old when Disney released The Little Mermaid. I can't remember, but it seems like this movie must have defined my youngest moments. I had a cassette tape story version memorized by age three and knew every word to every song as soon as I owned the VHS version.Well, I still love The Little Mermaid. In my opinion it is one of the five best-animated children's movies ever made. The characters are fun, fresh and wholesome, the songs are great and the story is meaningful.To me, Ariel's intense desire to see the world and live as a human is fabulously displayed in &quot;Part of that World&quot;, a song, which will always hold a place in my heart. Her passion and longing is so real, to me it is half the movie.This is not an artificial and frilly children's carousel ride, which lacks both plot and purpose. It's emotional, evocative and memorable. Every little girl should see The Little Mermaid.The ending makes me cry, every time as does the &quot;Part of Your World&quot; reprise.Do yourself a favor and buy this inarguably magnificent movie.	5.0	A childhood favorite	2002-08-10	6	5	1

My girls love many of the songs we play from YouTube, like ""Part of Your World"", but the evil enchantress and the sharks that ""kill"" make it all too scary for them.  My kids have 100's of DVDs, and preferred titles are: Angelina Ballerina, Ratatouille, Cars, Baby Enstein box set, Teletubbies, Rescue Hero, Alphabet Train, Dora the Explorer, Bob the Builder, Maisy, Kipper, Mickey Mouse (not all the old ones though), Winnie the Pooh Friendship series DVDs, Heffalump Movie, and Wiggles Big Red Car to name the favorites.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A23DYAYB23GT4B	"Syed Khurshid ""Syed Khurshid"""	"I first saw this movie in 2007, I've only heard about this from my cousins who lived in the US for a long time and now that I've seen it. I understood why it was so good. I've always loved Disney movies and this is my number one movie that I love. Its a classic story that everyone lovea to tell about, and that is about mermaid. A mermaid in love with a human and wanting to be a part of his world, and the sacrifices she has to make to get the love of her life. Its both heart warming and does truly touch you. Disney cracked the code and truly made it there own story. They've presented it in a way that truly is heart warming and worth watching. The princess in this film ""Ariel"" is truly one of the most unique princesses that we've seen and is truly special.One of the best things about this movie is the songs. Howard Ashman truly put all his heart in producing the music in this movie and it has some of the most memorable music that can never be forgotten like the music ""Part of your world"" which is truly is beautiful, and for some people it can relate to others in human life, another like ""kiss the girl"" is also a favorite. But the movie is also about a father and daughter relationship as well. It is a movie that made me realize how special daughters can be, and when they get married, how much love and pain it takes to give your daughter away; it has that kind of warmth as well.  As an adult with times things have changed, and with the way stories these days are made or told; stories like these are being made irrelevant in our kids lives which is not fair. It is a classic that shouldn't be forgotten and be shown to our kids againHowever there are some downside to this movie. With todays animation, it feels outdated and you can't blame them because it was made in the late 80's, but the Disney crew has done a great job at restoring the film's color. Another downside is that with the kids these days, it is more suited towards older kids, kids younger than 10 won't seem to enjoy it because kids want something spontaneous and funny, not a love story, Sadly! Kids won't be patient enough to watch and understand these movies. Also, one of the biggest controversy that people have made about this movie is about Ariel being 16 years old in this move. For me that is not a problem but todays parents won't want to influence there kids to run off at the age of 16 looking for there prince charming. To me this point is understandable but because it was made in the 80's and in the 80's there were kids that got married at that age, heck even my mother was 16 when she got married to my father and they've been happily married for 29 years, so you can't exactly blame them for not presenting something that isn't with the current times; but that is one issue that parents have made towards this,. But for me it is still something I love to watch with my daughter and she loves it as well because Ariel has also been shown as someone who seeks her dream, and wants to dream as well.The story is greatly told and I don't think there would be anyone out there who would have told it better than this. It is a classic that must never be forgotten, and a must have item for a fan of Disney, and its great classics. Its a great family movie and a must have item."	5.0	A classic that shouldn't be forgotten	2011-02-01	1	0	1

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A37NL9EDUT23IV	"takemehome ""Joey"""	"Like all other fans of this movie, I've impatiently waited for the last five years since the Platinum Editions line was formed in 2001 (Back when TLM was scheduled for a 2008 (!) re-release date, may I add.) for this Special 2-Disc Edition of the movie on DVD. Well today, two years earlier than originally planned, the Platinum Edition of The Little Mermaid is FINALLY available, and it's been well worth the wait.The centerpiece of the whole set is on disc 1 - the movie itself. Forget all the grain, softness, and other video issues on previous VHS releases, as well as the not-so-hot non-anamorphic transfer of the barebones 1999 Limited Issue DVD. THIS has been digitally restored, with colors punched up, most of the grain removed, and just all around made fantastic, and is presented in anamorphic widescreen, which means it's enhanced for 16:9 TV sets. It's never looked this gorgeous or amazing on video. It's never SOUNDED this good either. The sound mix is amazing. Trust me, if you own any of the two previous VHS tapes, and/or laserdiscs, and/or the Limited Issue DVD, you STILL need to get this just for the improvement in the video and audio.There are only a few bonuses on disc 1. The commentary and Ashley Tisdale music videos are ones I have not yet checked out, although I plan to listen to the commentary soon. The Little Mermaid III Musical Sneak Peek is also included. The quality of the animation is subpar, but not as subpar as what you see in the preview for Cinderella III, which looks like it was made by the same crappy animation team that did Cinderella II. Sad.Disc 2 does NOT contain a massive quantity of bonus materials like a few of the previous Platinum Edition DVDs like Snow White. However, this time around, Disney decided on quality over quantity. All the bonus materials make up ONE page of the DVD guide, but this time, Disney does not include much of the usual fluff from post-Snow White Platinum Editions, such as crappy games and 5 crappy pop videos. Ashley Tisdale's video is the only one in the set, and it's on disc 1. And instead of games, Disney includes a VERY special bonus in the Games and Activities section - a recreation of the cancelled Little Mermaid Attraction that was in development for Walt Disney World in the early 90's. With CGI animation, the ride that almost was is brought to life. There are two ways to explore it. You can explore it as a ride, with audio commentary. You can also explore it with ""Ride With Disney Imagineers,"" which lets you listen to the commentary AND view storyboards, the ride itself, and at certain points, turn on the lights so you can see all the stuff going on. I'm absolutely impressed with this bonus feature, and it's one that merits repeat viewing.The Deleted Scenes section of a Disney DVD usually only includes maybe two or three scenes. This one contains three deleted sequences, a song demo, and three alternate/extended versions of scenes that are in the movie, including an alternate ending. Among my favorites were the alternate version of Fathoms Below, where we learn that Ursula is Triton's SISTER. I also loved the alternate version of Poor Unfortunate Souls, which includes alternate lyrics from the original demo, as well as some additional dialogue. The final scene isn't a scene at all. Instead, it's audio from the quickly deleted song Silence Is Golden, which was to be Ursula's song, but lyricist Howard Ashman hated it and threw it out early in the picture, so it was never even storyboarded. The audio is played with a screen giving details of the song and a piece of developmental artwork of Ursula and Ariel. The Deleted Scenes section is absolutely awesome, and definitely something fun to watch.Backstage Disney is always the best part of a 2-Disc Disney DVD's extras. The Little Mermaid's Backstage Disney section is no exception. The central focus is the 45-minute documentary Treasures Untold. The documentary isn't just fluff about how they worked on the picture, etc. It also goes into detail about the management changes that made The Little Mermaid possible, and how *gasp* Jeffrey Katzenburg almost wouldn't let Part Of Your World be in the picture! They even acknowledge that they made The Black Cauldron in this one, which to me is absolutely shocking.In addition, there's a featurette on the Special Effects Unit, and the ""Story Behind The Story,"" (No, not a port over from the Beauty and the Beast DVD.) which talks about Hans Christian Andersen and the original fairy tale of TLM. However, a nice surprise is a new animated short based on Andersen's story The Little Match Girl. No dialogue, and set to Alexander Borodin's String Quartet #2, this short was intended for the now scrapped Fantasia 2006 project. This short is more melancholy than Disney's treatment of The Little Mermaid, but VERY faithful to the story, right down to keeping the bittersweet ending of the original tale intact. Rounding out this section are galleries, (Which include concept artwork done for a scrapped TLM project at Disney from the 1940's.) the early presentation reel which includes visual development drawings, concept art, etc. set to a demo version of Under The Sea, and the original 1989 theatrical trailer.I urge you, if you're a fan of this movie, even a casual one, PLEASE pick up this DVD. It's worth the cost JUST for the movie alone, but awesome and MEATY bonus features that, for the most part, break away from all the ""kiddie"" fluff oversaturating most Disney DVDs nowadays absolutely sweeten the deal.And to the people complaining that computer generated animation has been added to this DVD, any computer animation you see in this movie has always been there. The 80's saw a lot of experimentation with computer animation, and there's several instances of this, such as the opening shot of the ship in the movie, as well as a staircase background later in the movie. In addition, the wedding scene was also the first usage of Disney's new computer colorization program, which would be used to full effect in Beauty and the Beast, along with complete scenes featuring computer animation. The only thing in this movie that is different from the older versions is that the preist's ""excitement"" has been digitally airbrushed out. *Although since it's actually his knee and not the far more sexual thing people claim it is...*"	5.0	Disney Does The Little Mermaid Good With DVD Treatment	2006-10-03	28	23	5

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A3NJTCN3HE0B11	Tassinong	"As a radio reporter, I had the opportunity to express these views to the film's director in person--so when I say that many Baby Boomers, when they first saw the ship emerge from the mists, they got the same genre-renaissance jolt that science fiction did when they first saw the rollup in ""Star Wars.""  The delight continued through the film, which had the best original songs since ""Dumbo"" and ushered in a new style for Disney in which the songs weren't just animated, they moved the story forward Broadway-like in the manner of Rodgers and Hammerstein (hence the subsequent staged adaptations of this and other animated features.  IMO, ""The Little Mermaid"" remains the best, because those working on the project could not realize beforehand what they had accomplished, and so weren't overdoing their efforts to be entertaining (coincidentally, also like ""Dumbo"").  I can't recall another film that has garnered THREE Best Song nominations, and again IMO, ""Part of Your World"" should have won.  In any case, it rendered the end of the Ashman-Menken team a tragedy on a par with the end of Adler-Ross.  The only shame is that the studio brought Andersen's original ending--which in the final analysis IS a happy ending--crashing to earth, much the same as they did with ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier"" segment in ""Fantasia 2000.""  Which bring me to the real reason to beg, borrow, or steal this edition (especially if the bonus features are not retained on the re-release that reportedly is in the works for an upcoming 3-D theatrical release):  The inclusion of the studio's 2007 candidate for Best Animated Short, ""The Little Match Girl,"" a segment intended for the aborted ""Fantasia 2006.""  As a third IMO, it is easily the most beautiful short Disney has ever made, not only because of the use of Borodin's ""Nocturne,"" but because the ending is not at all sugar-coated.  It's only the third time I can recall that Disney has allowed a ""downer"" ending--the other two are ""Education for Death"" and ""Chicken Little"" (both 1943).  It's too bad Disney has an overwhelmingly self-conscious ""we can do no wrong and never have"" mindset, unlike, say Warner Brothers, which has put only censored versions of ""Aladdin"" and ""Fantasia"" on home video and has denied us entirely a disc of ""Song of the South"" (although it freely uses its Oscar- winning ""Zip-a-dee-doo-dah"").

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1W68QUF8TLJ98	"T. Callahan ""*Um...A Signature?*"""	There was once a time in Disney History when the term &quot;That movie underwater&quot;  didn't bring to mind a forgetfull blue tang, but rather a Jamacian Crustacian bellowing &quot;Unda' Da' Sea!&quot;.Now many people will argue that this is infact a Disney Classic, while others will argue it was just a mediocre effort. I however, am not sure where I stand on this film.The Little Mermaid, the film that ended Disneys 80's menu, and as also one of the last to be based on a classic tale,  is about a little mermaid, (Obviously) who, against her father King Tritents warnings,  frequently goes above water, collecting human things (forks, mirrors, pipes etc.)  She soon &quot;Meets&quot; a Prince, and falls in love, also against her fathers wishes.  Add in a villian, and some funny side characters and you've got &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;.This film dosen't do it for me, sadly.  Because I've rarely watched it as a child, it has no nostalgia value,  the back-bone for why I watch and love Disney Films.  The animation is so-so, and the story isn't very strong.  I sugest you rent this movie if you haven't already seen it, and then decide for yourself if you really want.	3.0	Nostalgia	2004-06-25	12	3	9

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	AVWCDSTES2RZY	"That one guy - you know the one ""Dennis"""	"It's funny.  A list of some of my favorite movies include Fight Club (awesome) Gladiator (Epic)  Dogma (Funny, controversial, and FILLED with many ""truths"" (which many would beg to differ;)about religion)  The Nightmare Before Christmas (a work of true genius). But the movie that outshines them all in my eyes, includes Ariel?My first experience with ""The Little Mermaid"" was a Japanese Anime Version from the 70's,  her name was Marina, she was topless, and she died at the end of the story, but I was drawn to it, it was sad, but beautiful, love and devotion, and her willing to give up everything for love? I was 5 and I could see it- it was beautiful.  But when I was 8 or 9, My Mom bought disney's Bambi on VHS, and before it started, there was a preview for a new Disney version of the story I loved, the regular generic blonde haired Mermaid replaced with a spunky red head with a Purple SeaShell bra, and a singing crab? Disney had never let me down before, and I couldn't wait until I could see it. It was May or 1990 when the Little Mermaid hit VHS, and I was utterly captivated.  Not only did the story create a much happier ending (some literary fans may have been upset, but I LOVED it!) but where before there was just a Mermaid, Ariel became the object of my nine year old affection, and she still is (my wife isn't always happy with this, but she seems to understand)When I watch the movie now, I do realize that compared to the films that followed, the animation is a little lacking at times (very similiar to Disney's 80's Television animation)- but it still has that certain something. My favorite scene is during the Part of your World Reprise (when Ariel is watching Eric leaving after she saves him) and the look  in her eyes is unbelievable, along with the sound of her voice (Jodi Benson has one of the most beautiful voices in the world), you can see and hear the longing, the love, the obsession, it gets me every time, I know every word to every song, the animation, being handdrawn through almost the entire movie, makes it a piece of art, the songs are incompareable, and the story is purely Disney (meaning Disney in the Beauty and the Beast good way - not the Cinderella II, Tarzan and Jane way)Although the ""Limited Issue"" edition is a little lacking in bonus features, and by ""little Lacking"" I mean, ""What? Not even a trailer?"" It is an amazing presentaion of the film- crisp clear picture, Dolby Digital sound, enough to bring the experience, and help me relive that same feeling I had when I was 9 (wow- a little over 15 years ago)I'm hoping the other reviewers are right on the release date- the original Platinum Edition release was 2010 (back when the series first started)- then I heard 2008, now I hear 2006 (Oh PLEASE let it be so- I could just die!I think everyone from little girls, to little boys, to grown Men and Women should see this film! It single handedly led Disney into a new golden age! It's a classic, and a masterpiece, and to me, the greatest movie ever!"	5.0	My favorite Movie of ALL TIME	2005-03-28	4	3	1
0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A30X9M0J5WOVAS	The IEMommy	Love, love, LOVE The Little Mermaid so of course I jumped at the chance to review The Little Mermaid Diamond Edition! The Little Mermaid holds a special place in my heart for two reasons.This came out when I was a teenager so it reminds me of my youth and childhood. A little girl I babysat loved to watch it over and over again so I had it memorized as a teenager!My four year old daughter Paige is OBSESSED with The Little Mermaid so it connects my childhood and hers! And when I say obsessed, I don't use that term lightly!Paige's room is decorated as Ariel. Her lunchbox, backpack, clothing, jewelry, toys; all Ariel. Every single Friday for share day at school she brings a different Ariel. Her birthday party was Ariel. The first ride we always go on at California Adventure - Ariel! When we went and saw Second Screen Live to test out the App she knew all the songs and trivia. You get the picture - obsessed!So as soon as this arrived she insisted on watching it because we haven't seen THIS Little Mermaid before! I tried to explain it was the same but thankfully, this edition does include some things that weren't included in the original. Thank you bonus features! She loved the new music video and could watch it all day.This is actually my third version of The Little Mermaid because Paige keeps watching them to the point of destruction! This is the first time we have seen on Blu-Ray so it makes the experience even more magical (if possible).  The Little Mermaid Diamond Edition is a must have for all you Ariel fans out there!	5.0	More Magical Than Ever	2013-10-01	4	1	3
0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A17B9MOP3FIJUF	"The Loved One ""curiouser and curiouser!"""	This is such a great film and it works on so many different levels.On one level, it reminds me of the universal desire and need for transcendence, to look beyond the confines of our everyday surroundings.  Ariel is a dweller of the underworld, symbolically represented by the sea.  The sea is replete with marvelous treasures and bounteously provides Ariel with all of her material needs.  Indeed, she would never be in want of material possessions because as a princess the whole sea belongs to her.  Even so, she yearns for another world qualitatively different from her own, the world of humans above her.  This need for transcendence is not prompted by any rational instinct, but the common passion to break through the mundane into a brave new world of the extraordinary.  Ariel's aching for transformation and transcendence of the everyday world of the sea is the exact same longing that all people experience whether they aspire on the spiritual level to reach heaven or on a secular level, to revolutionize the world in hopes of achieving a utopia.The transformation that allows Ariel to become a land dweller requires a sacrifice: she must forfeit her voice to the evil sea had, Ursula.  This is excellent symbolism.  Kierkegaard discusses how as finite beings, we can only communicate in finite languages.  For instance, linguistically, our speech is limited by its form: a Frenchman only speaking Franais can communicate no better to a German speaker than he could to a pelican.  But on a deeper level, as humans we can only communicate in the language of logic and reason and yet these systems of communication are painfully limited.  We long to speak a universal, transcendent, divine language, but we fall painfully short; if we could speak the language of the infinite and divine, we would no longer be human because as humans we by definition finite.  If we as finite human beings were instantly transferred to a terrain of the infinite, like heaven, our limited, finite and human means of communication would render us unable to communicate.  With words only, how would you communicate with a transcendent, immaterial being like an angel and how would an angel communicate with you?  In other worlds, like Ariel, we too would be without the ability to communicate, without a voice.  Remembering how our painfully limited and encumbering our means of communication would be if we ever had to communicate with angels helps to enhance our viewing experience by aiding us in imagining Ariel's plight as our own.What really struck me about this film is that what can bridge the gap between worlds is not the linguistics of a certain spoken dialect, but the language of love and empathy.  Even without a voice, Ariel is able to communicate with Eric the prince through her innate kindness and sympathy.  This film is a marvelous testament to the power of human warmth against the alienation, fragmentation and silence of modern times.	5.0	This Movie Mer-Made Me Smile	2004-05-14	8	5	3

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A38F8GF33ZMKBJ	The Review Penguin	"The Little Mermaid is my favorite Disney animated movie ever. Nothing beats the final scene of Ariel in her sparkly dress or the sound of her voice in the conch shell. Unfortunately, it does have some few minor flaws. The biggest of all, for me, are the steps. The hideous, hideous steps. There is a scene where Ariel rushes down some palace steps. The only problem is that the steps aren't animated- they're CGI. In an animated movie. They stick out like a sore thumb, and every time I see them I wince. I know it probably saved Disney a lot of $$$ while they were making the film, but I would've loved it if they had been reanimated for the remastered edition. Also, ""Under the Sea"" stretches a little too long for my taste and... well, that's about it. You really can't find t00 much at fault with such a classic."	4.0	My favorite Disney animated movie	2008-07-08	4	1	3
0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A2V1KIEKXRI94W	Therin	This was a gift for my granddaughter, but she is not allowed to watch it because Ariel is seen as a weak woman who gives up everything for a man; my son and his wife do not want this message presented to their 4-year old until she is old enough to understand the implications of the choice Ariel makes. I grew up on fairy tales, and though they were written versions and not Disney productions, I loved them and still grew to be a very independent, strong woman. My granddaughter is very bright.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1ZAN7KBME97B3	Tiger100M	"Now truthfully, I bought this movie for my sister, which is why it lacks the last star. But I love Ariel's beautiful body, Scuttle's stupidity, Sebastian's crankiness, and the good use of conflicts. I like the ocean theme, and I also like how Ursula is a luring villain, similar to Kaa. And let's not forget the CGI (computer generated imagery) effects like on the ships and storms. The Little Mermaid inherited those computer effects from ""The Great Mouse Detective"", my personal favorite classic.However, I will be honest, even though I am respecting and somewhat enjoying this film, it didn't really have a great impact on me, the same way it impacted the people when it came out. I thought it was too much of a girl's movie and that I was ""forbidden"" to watch it. I did catch a glimpse of a few shots, but most of them scared me, especially King Triton destroying the grotto, that was the scene that scared me the most! And another thing, after looking at IGN's top 25 animated movie list, I don't really like remembering how it ""saved"" the studio anymore. It just makes me feel guilty for liking some of the 1970's/80's films, specifically Aristocats, Robin Hood, The Rescuers, and my favorite The Great Mouse Detective. I  researched them, and they did not do terribly, they were just moderate successes as opposed to ""grand slams""( except Black Cauldron which I know really WAS a failure). Besides, if it were not for ""The Great Mouse Detective"", there wouldn't BE "" Little Mermaid""!I know, I know I am sorry, but I just did not like it very well growing up. I fairly enjoy it more nowadays, but the whole fairy tale princess thing just held me back for far too long."	3.0	Memorable Mermaid!	2011-07-02	1	1	0

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	AOTJ5ZXZDKBPY	Trey Austin	Okay, I know what you are thinking.  The Little Mermaid?  Are You Serious??  The answer for you who are thinking that is yes.  I remember this movie from a long time ago.  Me bring 16 now, I don't watch it as much as I did when I was about 10 or 6 but, it is in my collection of movies that rock and roll!  The Little Mermaid at first was a cheesy movie but, after watching it after 2 times, I started to fell the vibe that it had and preformed on anyone who watches it for the first time.  This is the best Disney movie there will ever be and you can't change my mind and no one can or could.  The movie follows the life of a mermaid named Ariel who is ALWAYS in trouble over one thing or another.  She fall's in love with a human and when her father hears about this, he can't believe it.  After forbidding her from seeing him or going to watch him, she does it anyways.  There is something for everyone in this major film about the life and wonderings of the teenage mermaid Ariel.	5.0	How Brillant For A Disney Movie!	2003-12-14	2	1	1

For me, it was a walk down memory lane.  I love the movie, and this set has it all.  The music is great and now on my ipod and computer.  The digital copy is great to have, just make sure you down load it sooner rather than later because it says that the code expires (although I have never had an issue with these codes actually expiring.)

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	AY6A8KPYCE6B0	Tyson	Everybody knows that The Little Mermaid is classic Disney, so I'll skip the movie review for now. I just want to say that the BLU RAY transfer is really gorgeous and comparable to some of the best Disney BDs I own, such as Beauty and the Beast and Alice in Wonderland (1951).The whole color palette is signature Disney and really pops in 1080p. It doesn't look too digitized though, as Disney will sometimes do. It looks classic. Soft where it should be and very sharp when it should be too. I've seen this movie probably 100 times, but I can honestly say that watching it in full HD was like seeing it again for the first time. Without HD, you don't really how much ART was put into the movie. Some of the backdrops literally took my breath away.As for Audio, it is flawless as well. Delicious surround-sound water noises, fabulous orchestral musical numbers, deep thunderous booms for Ursula. It probably won't show off your system like a super hero movie, but it does sound really, really, really good.I don't have a 3D TV yet, so I can't comment on that yet, although my friend does have one and he said that the 3D transfer was a little lame. Mostly depth and atmospheric effects, not a lot of pop. I'm okay with that, not really a big 3D guy anyway.OVERALL: Disney lovers, HD fanatics and anybody else - this is a must-have for the collection. HIGHLY recommended!	5.0	Blu Ray Review	2013-10-01	8	7	1

When the wicked sea octopus Ursula makes Ariel a deal that if she  will grant Ariel's wish for legs but if she doesn't kiss the Prince within  3 days, Ariel will become Ursula's property.I love this adorable film so  much!

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1XM11FGFPILLS	"Visa ""the artist"""	Read a whole lot of reviews and no one mentions the 3d. This is the best of the Disney animated movies converted to 3d so far. It is truly amazing at times, it even has a few times where something sticks out of the screen and the depth is always wonderful. I only noticed two scenes (and they last only a second or two) where the new 3d angles don't match up. The effects are far better then those of the Lion King or Beauty and the Beast. Without a doubt this is the best the Little Mermaid has ever looked or sounded. While I like the movie a whole lot, I do question the story at times. It seems to be saying that it's ok to break the rules and if you're caught, ok to run away from home and break even more rules....but maybe I'm looking at it to seriously.	5.0	what about the 3d?	2013-10-14	5	4	1

And it was extremely enchanting, still. I love this movie: the music, story, and characters.Ariel is not your normal mermaid princess, she longs for a life above the water. Her father openly disapproves her dream, but Ariel still fights for it. ANoneyand even accomplishes it when she sees Eric, the handsome land prince. She falls madly in love and turns to the evil sea witch for help. Ariel has only 3 days to make Eric fall for her. Easy, right? Wrong, in exchange for legs, ariel must give up her voice.the movie is delightful for all ages. Girls will love the romance and Ariel. Boys will love the action.

0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A11GLL7IC6XTJA	XiaoKai Li	"The Little Mermaid is without a doubt a timeless classic. In my opinion it's the best modern Disney work since Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty. Character development, plotline, visuals, vocals...everything is superb! Plus unforgettable songs like ""Under the Sea"", ""Kiss the Girl"", and my favorite ""Part of Your World"".I rated this item with 4 stars and not 5 because the Limited Edition DVD has very little special features... by little I mean almost none. If you can wait for the Platinum Edition, then I'd suggest you wait. I couldn't wait so that is why I got this edition."	4.0	My Favorite Disney Film	2005-12-09	2	1	1
0788812408	The Little Mermaid (Fully Restored Special Edition) [VHS]	A1SZ9VQDL6DGVT	XXX	This movie is wonderful, but wait for Disney to release the Platinum version, and then purchase it directly from Amazon or another authorized seller.  There are fake copies being sold through 3rd party sellers.  They look new packaged and sealed.  It is a violation of Amazon rules for a 3rd party seller to knowingly sell fake copies.  If you have received a fake copy you must send it back to the seller.  If they do not refund your money immediately you can use Amazon's a-z guarantee to get your money back.  This is regardless whether you have opened the copy or used it.  Do not let a seller force you to leave good feedback in order to receive a refund that is also a violation of Amazon's polices.

I've loved it that much. I finally got this dvd and it's like a dream come true. I too was a bit disappointed  by its lack of 'side dishes(special features)', which never stops me loving  this film. What a lovely story! How wonderful the music is! This dvd is a  must have.P.S. A video pause in chapter 17 is not a glitch. It is the  very moment for switching to the other layer.	5.0	A long waited DVD... at last in my hands!	1999-12-18	2	2	0
