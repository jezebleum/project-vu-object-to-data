1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3A1OA237FOZFK	#1 Amazon Fan	While I greatly respect Al Gore's devotion and passion for the causes he believes in, the things he presents here are simply not provable in the grandest sense.  How many of us have been around for a few thousand years to see and know firsthand how factual this information truly is?  The earth has gone through many changes and will continue to do so, but the whole greenhouse effect and global warming theory is just that - theory.  Yes, you can put up factual information and I won't deny it, but that doesn't mean you mix it up with theory and come out with the end all cause and solution.It's just like those who want to blame everything that happens in the US on the President.  A president can be in office for 3 months and something dramatic happens to the economy, and suddenly everyone blames him.  Like a president could have that much effect on the entire economy in such a short period of time.I am not discouraging anyone from watching this film, but rather am saying that people need to start listening with both ears and that includes listening, reading, and watching all sides of an issue and then coming to an educated opinion/position of their own.  Quit letting others do your thinking for you and telling you what you should or should not believe.  These statements are inconvenient truths, and I hope you are open-minded enough to realize just how much they are.	1.0	You can't believe everything you hear	2006-12-11	108	24	84

But as he did,  if anyone admits to the issue,  they will also have to take ownership toward the effort.  And unfortunately too many politicians are too concerned about their own agendas.In a sense America is sadly not only proverbially going up in smoke, but also literally.  Brings to light a different meaning to the term ""melting pot"".  Hmm... is not just culturally, is it?"	5.0	Extremely enlightening	2013-06-16	2	1	1
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	"Vice President Al Gore and director Davis Guggenheim have teamed up together to provide a compelling presentation.  Using charts and statistics with the simple, effective skills President Reagan used, Al Gore goes through diagnosing, sampling, then convincing us of the existence of global warming.  Having been no stranger to the topic for decades, he demonstrates stunning global pictures that document its effects upon the entire global landscape.  Beautiful cinematography and quiet evocative music garnish his presentation that is poignantly laced with autobiographical narratives of key moments of his life.  Also, he interrupts his lecture to tell some funny jokes to keep the electricity of the audience flowing.  The former Vice President takes his composite picture and evidence, and, then he asserts that it is a moral, not a political imperative that we reverse these trends with a myriad of CO2 reducing porposals.  He also, like a skillful debater, surfaces the rebuttals by the opposition and offers his own counterpoints.  (For instance, he honestly shows that C02 levels go in cycles over a long history even before scientists obtained the means to measure it, but one of his most eye-opening statistic is that C02 levels have never been 300 parts per million until now.  No cycle has ever looked as C02 saturated as long or as hugely as the time in which we now live.)This documentary should be seen by everyone, especially the skeptics.  Most of the people who comment about the movie were already convinced of global warming, but that isn't to say there's no wisdom in firing up the troups.  Global warming is such a divisive issue, and the ramifications are so important that, even those who believe that global warming is a hoax or that it is real, but a natural cycle, need to know what they're debating.  It is always illuminating to know more about what you believe, but it's also important for the general public to get a hearing about a major issue.There were a couple of minor weaknesses.  First of all, Vice President Al Gore is a politician.  Most commentators say this isn't a political DVD.  Not true.  To the liberals, I say, it is political.  To the conservatives, I say, who cares?  In the middle of the DVD, the movie shows the 2000 Presidential race debacle.  This happens a long time after the Vice President makes the point that the Bush Administration has abandoned its promises about the environment.  The context of film clips of the election is political.  Convincing the public of global warming is a political debate.  Al Gore does a great job, but I thought the brief lapse with the 2000 election detracted from his message briefly.  Secondly, and also minor, his charts show that global warming has brought about an increase of new species.  (Shouldn't we be frightened if the changes didn't?  Afterall, where would we be if that didn't happen with the climate changes that wiped out the dinosaurs?)  He then adds that trees have been devastated by growing species of beetles.  (Maybe new, sturdier trees will evolve.  Of course moral presumption in environmental matters isn't prudent, either.)One of the best arguments he makes is about money.  He shows how little dissent there is among scientists, except those paid by corporations, like oil companies.  One of his best analogies is when he shows that there were ads after the surgeon general's claims about smoking, which read, ""More doctors smoke Camels than any other brand.""  Such is the opposition now to global warming.Is Al Gore cherry picking highlights or an environmental Henny Penny?  The results are too important not to be focused and find out for ourselves.

The earth has actually been cooling since 1998, but the libs and ""environmentalist"" would have you believe that we will all be dead very shortly.  Actually according to the great Gore we should've all died yrs ago isn't that right liberals????  Gotcha!!!!  Global warming is the biggest hoax ever created and it was created to tax everyone and everything and it will help lead to a one world government and then well christians you know the rest.  If liberals really want to help they should just go ahead and cease breathing since their co2 is killing the planet.  I mean just the fact that humans are breathing out co2 is killing the planet so really we should all go find another Jim Jones to follow and drink the cool-aid so we can help save the planet.

Chacon ""goes_m"""	"The movie is technically well made etc and allows one to see Al Gore more of a person than the wooden figure he seemed to be when running for president.  Although parts of the movie seem to play like ""Al Gore for President Mk II"" for the most part the movie is non-political and blaming  people seems to be avoided.The movie is for the most part a recording of a presentation that Al Gore has given many times about global warming.  It seems smooth (but not slick) with touches of humor etc to underline its points.  It is aimed at the non-technical and I would imagine that just about anyone who reads the newspaper will be able to come away from the movie understanding its message.It would seem that the filming of a lecture style presentation would be boring (I have been to more lectures than I care to remember) but they manage to keep it moving along and I did not find any parts boring or slow.Given the nature of the debate about global warming, I would watch this to see a good presentation of the issues.

Bitincka	"The only negative points on this documentary that I've seen in some reviews here, in other places and in the media as well are that Al Gore shares too much of his personal life and his lifetime important events that might have little to do with the subject of global warming.I think that almost every reference made to his personal life if taken without the prejudgment of personal promotion is relevant in making this movie more complete and more interesting. It shows his personal journey with ""the possible climate crisis"" as he faced some very interesting facts as early as his undergrad years.If you carefully connect the points about the attitude shown by politicians and even people in general to the weight example and fog parallelism even the death of the his kid and sister do make a lot of sense on what he trying to achieve.I do think though that they could have cut a few of scenes just showing Al Gore working on his presentation (moving pictures around) on his apple laptop. With that said it is more compelling to me at least to see the person with a struggle, that should be everyone's struggle, every step of the way than just a scientific documentary with a narrative on the background."	5.0	Comments in regards to Al Gore's personal life in the movie	2006-11-24	5	3	2

We have heard the cries for many years now to make changes.  Although it seems that in the United States we have an attuitude of plenty.  This movie has an ability to help people realize that the tap doesn't flow free.  Unfortunately we may hit a major dry spell if things don't change.  In the next fifty years we may see changes that would be uncomparable to any time in our history. These dramatic changes can be very sad to watch.  The emotion soon turns to anger and hopefully from that turns to positive action.The signs are obvious and continue to become more dramtic as every year passes.  The Earth has always fluctuated between ice ages and natural warm ups.  Except now we are seeing something on such an expansive and dramatic scale that we are hard pressed to find anything that has occurred comparitively in the history of this planet.  It may be to late to change.  I hope it's not.  I hope that everyone who sees this will try and make a commitment to help make this world a better place.  This message is not political.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3SS60GFUOXNV0	ACT I	What I would like to see is a followup to Gore's movie that presents a fictionalized account of the situation that exists in the U. S. in, say, 2050, and one family's attempt to cope with the changes that are occurring.  By 2100 the world's population is likely to be reduced to but a fraction of its current 7 billion, and between now and then our society will most assuredly disintegrate.  A movie that brought this out might wake enough people up to the disaster that faces us that the probability of more surviving would be increased at least somewhat.  I would like to believe that my grandchildren have a future, but have serious doubts about this.	4.0	A followup	2011-12-28	0	0	0
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3BVPXYP9XE0XN	"Actor, Dancer, Techie ""Avid Book Buyer"""	"I must admit that I was not a big fan of Al Gore when he ran for President in 2000.  Yes, I agreed with a lot of his views but he seemed to have the air of the elite about him.  I voted for him because ""he's not GWB"" almost as much as because of his platform.  However, in recent years that has changed.  I was thrown by his outward presentation style just as many in the U.S. were.  In truth, he's quite an informed and dedicated public servant.As such, now 6 years into the W administration, I see how the environmental issues of not just the U.S. but of the world have been swept under the carpet of ""more important issues"".  Are the subjects of prayer in school, gay marriage, the war on terror and social security and health care reform important issues?  (*insert expletive here*) YES.  Of course they are important issues.  They tend to divide our nation.  Any issue that does that is important.  But somewhere along the line our poisoning of the earth got lumped together with the ""religious"" issues I just mentioned.  Public opinion seems to say that if you support taking action towards solving global warming you then support those hot issues listed above (restricting religious teachings in public schools, allowing even civil unions for gays or a revisiting of how we have approached the war on terror).  Hence, supporting the fight on global warming has become against Christianity and (unfortunately) against America.And just look at our administration.  They are doing NOTHING to combat it because they are under the impression that it will irrevocably hurt the commerce in our nation.  And, yes, I was concerned about the commercial aspects of ""radical"" change in our environmental policy ... until Al Gore revealed that the diminishing of ozone destroying emissions has been successful.Did you know that?  I didn't.  And I didn't because of 2 very important facts:1.  I never heard about it from the media.2.  I never heard a big industrial corporation complain.  Never.It works and with barely a speed bump in our industries.I'll end with the following; If those who follow the teachings of modern Christianity are so literal of their interpretation of the Bible, why does the earth come under the category of something we can abuse?  If God gave us free reign over the earth to do as we will, does it necessarily mean that we should mistreat it?  We don't tolerate spousal or child abuse.  Why tolerate the poisoning of our world?  And what of the idea that God puts hardships in front of us to test us?  Could it not be that He gave us free reign over this planet in order to see if we might destroy it, hence, failing this test?And what of the perspective of ""sins""?  I have heard it put that homosexuality is the most grievous sin imaginable.  Could someone please explain that to me?  A gay relationship involves 2 people just as any committed relationship involves.  Two.  In poisoning the earth we threaten (nowadays) billions.  That tells us something; we have a MAJOR problem that concerns everyone in the world including Christians.  (Who, by the way, are part of the single most popular religion on the planet.  Persecuted?  I don't think so.)  Regardless of the hotbed issues the U.S.A. has been focused on, preserving our planet for future generations of Christians and Muslims and Jews and Republicans and Democrats and liberals and conservatives (to name just a few) alike seems far more important.Let's save these other issues for a time when we're not facing world-wide crises that affects every faith."	5.0	Important religious implications	2007-01-27	6	3	3

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3MV1KKHX51FYT	Acute Observer	"Documentaries lie on the continuum between fact and fiction. They show recreated reality as the producer sees it. Will the paying audience agree? Al Gore's anecdote about South America and Africa demonstrates the changing styles of science. Will today's beliefs become as obsolete as 18th century science? Gore says pollution causes global warming by trapping heat that would escape into space. Is carbon dioxide the sole cause? What if the output from the sun is increasing? What if the orbit of the earth is nearer to the sun? Gore explains his arguments. There was global warming during Medieval times. One difference is the higher level of CO2 compared to the estimates from the past. Gore predicts skyrocketing levels in 50 years. [If true, people will die off as during the Global Cooling of the 14th century and solve the problem until the next cycle.]Gore said the ten hottest years of the past 2 centuries were in the past decades; the earth is warming up since the last Ice Age. The warmer oceans create bigger hurricanes. Was the New Orleans disaster of 2005 due in part to faulty engineering or politics? Gore lost the 2000 Presidential election because he didn't carry his home state of Tennessee. Was that due to his advocacy of NAFTA or the Gun Ban? Did people distrust Gore's judgment? Global warming causes both floods and droughts. Ocean and wind currents redistribute tropic heat. This film also advertises Al Gore as if he was running for office again. Gore explains the effects of earlier springs on increasing insects that adversely affect human life. Gore says the melting glaciers of Greenland can cause ocean levels to rise by 20 feet. This would devastate Florida, San Francisco, and other places because of the rise of the oceans. If that invisible shield keeps heat in wouldn't it also stop heat from the sun?Could the world's population have tripled in 40 years? Wouldn't that require massive increases in food? Carbon emissions correlate to relative wealth of the countries. An urban legend (?) Of a frog in hot water is used as a warning. Gore's older sister smoked cigarettes and died of lung cancer. [Gore didn't explain this as caused by big corporations and their advertising.] The lack of articles questioning global warming could demonstrate censorship. Big corporations funded universities and direct research, its not just the White House that manipulates statistics. Gore failed to point out how Big Oil has rigged the laws to create high gasoline consumption. Just look at America before the 1950s when people shopped and worked at local small businesses and most did not own automobiles or air conditioners. ""Are you ready to change the way you live?"" [Are you, Senator Gore?] The film gives a number of suggestions to reduce energy consumption voluntarily. [Gore does not recommend nationalizing Big Oil to prevent further damage to the people and environment, as has happened since the 1940s. Countries like Mexico and Venezuela that nationalized their oil industries have low gas prices and energy independence.]"	3.0	The Warning About Global Summer	2008-09-24	2	0	2
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AO31JF8HT1ONU	"Adam J. Fernandes ""DarkWriter"""	"I have to say one thing at the start of this review. I'm gonna air some dirty laundry that I have concering what I've learned thanks to this film. The film itself is amazing. Beautfully shot and edited by Davis Guggenheim that finds the balance between the lecture and Gore's journey.One of the criticisms leveled at this film was why Gore seemed so passionate here and on the 2000 Election he seemed bland and the Frankenstein creature as Jonah Goldberg called him in National Review. He makes it clear in the film that what that election did was wake him up in some way. After ""losing"" the election he had to asess what he had to do next and, after being a career enviromentalist in the Senate, he knew what he had to do. He learned and studied and went places where the threat of global warming was at it's highest.I also feel that he won't run for president in 08. He's spent thirty or so years in government. As he says, ""The victories that weren't really victories."" He's probably burned out by it and he no longer has faith that the government can solve these problems and I, quite frankly, feel the same way.Watching this, I couldn't help but think about the average person's response to something like gas prices. When they start going up, all you hear from people are when and if the prices our gonna go down. You don't hear people talking about things like mass transit, alterative fuels, etc. Granted, it's not the immediate concern but what I'm saying is you NEVER here it. You hear it now because of films like this, because of Hurricane Katrina, the introduction of the Hybrid vehicles. What does that mean? It means that like the doc ""The Corporation"" said, that corporate (and even govermental) social responsiblity is a PR scheme, it's a marketing decision, and they can go back on them if they see their profits drop. It also makes our responisbility as consumers clear, we have to make it clear, by what we buy and do, that they can't go back to their old ways.But concluding this rant, and I'm sorry for that, I have a darker view of humanity after seeing this film. I have become an pessimistic optopmist. I want something like the sea levels rising 20 feet, or another ice age hitting Europe, or sea level acidity rising so it can't support various kinds of life. I want something like that to happen because, as Gore points out, our nervous system is like the frog in the lukewarm water being slowly brought to a boil, cause that's what it's gonna take.

Gore is also being sued by the creator of the weather channel for Gore's attempts to create a carbon credit business. Carbon credits were personally designed by this guy as the perfect money making scheme. He could have made millions for selling the privilege for factories to function. All of the charts that he shows are wrong. The major fact that this Global Warming is a political weapon is that according to actual Scientists and not college dropouts have shown that the world is going to get colder, not warmer! The actual scientists have shown that the increase in temperature was caused by the SUN!!! The Sun was going through an up cycle over the last few years, and now its decreasing its output. But now the politicals are saying that now global warming/cooling is now global climate change. Which basically means that every time the temperature goes in either direction its caused by the negligible increase in carbon dioxide. This is just the ultimate political weapon. Far better than the bird flu that everyone was supposed  to die from a few years ago.SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!	1.0	Big lies, little show	2008-04-06	28	10	18
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3C3DIHD4LZ81C	Alex Cole	You know, I was pretty much not a 'greenie'. Too many Chicken Little predictions of catastrophe and impending doom over my 50+ years (mostly by the press misquoting and sensationalizing scientific studies) that just did not happen, too much rabid environmentalism (eco-Nazis)that would prefer that we all return to the 'lifestyle' of say, the 7th century...and too much evidence that the Earth's automatic control systems were little-understood and vastly underrated by scientists ( recall the predictions that the Mt. St. Helens area would be 'dead' for a century or more- and its rebirth in less than 2 years). I did not believe that Global Warming was a defensible scientific platform (not enough cogent data)until three or four years ago. But having witnessed the eco-terrorism upswing perpetrated by the current administration, I have become green- not a radical but a moderate. But it is time that the moderates stand up with one rational voice and demand change.An Inconvenient Truth is a thoughtful, ethical, non-political statement about the science behind Global Warming- there is no screaming, shouting, name-calling radicalism- just the facts. Explained so that everyone can understand where we are and that there is no longer any debate. Explained by a man of passion and integrity around the subject. A wonderful change from those propoganda soundbytes the news gives us denying the now obvious error of our ways, and the consequences we are suffering now and will suffer in the very near future because of our errors.I still believe that the Earth will take care of itself in spite of human activity, the only question is whether we prefer the result to be with or without happy, healthy human inhabitants.Al, if you're reading this, I never thought I'd say it, but Thank You for this film and your tireless efforts.Everyone in America needs to see An Inconvenient Truth. And we all need to drag our  Congresspersons by their heels (or, if necessary, by their REPLACEMENTS) toward rationality and action on this issue. And we must also assume individual responsibility however we can- plant a tree (or 10,000), bicycle to work, buy energy-efficient appliances and vehicles- whatever we can do, just do it now.We can have an impact as individuals that adds up to a massive change as a nation, and an unbelievable change as a world. The technology is available, what we lack is will.PS- you may or may not agree with me, you may still doubt the science, but think of this- even if Global Warming is still highly overstated, wouldn't it be nice to cut back our oil-based economy so that we no longer support dictatorships, terrorists, and insane, greedy corporations like Exxon and BP with our oil dollars?	5.0	The only movie you NEED to see and understand	2006-11-22	8	5	3

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A24F6WO9P543E7	Alex	Al Gore is trying to convince us that the rise in CO2 levels in the atmosphere is causing warmer temperatures.  That is his premise.  So he shows graphs that illustrate how over the years as the level of CO2 rises so does global temperature.  Well guess what?  What if you want to interpret the graph the other way around?  Suppose the natural increases in temperature are causing CO2 levels to rise.  Maybe because of a natural, cyclical rise in temp more forests are burning and less trees are processing CO2 into oxygen.  Well, the point is that you can interpret bits and pieces of scientific data to meet your needs.  The reason I gave this a 3 star rating is because I was entertained and amused by AG.

I never bought into those people that say it's a made up phenomenon.  I know that I'm part of the problem, being wasteful and not eco conscience. Honestly though, I never gave it too much thought...until I watched this documentary.  Al Gore delivers his message straight forward, in plain simple language and that message is clear.  Change needs to happen in the way we, mankind, are treating the planet.  Think whatever you want about Al Gore, he'll enlighten you if you don't already know.  Hopefully he'll make you care about this issue and want to see changes made within our government and just maybe, he'll get you to make some changes in your home.  Throughout the film, he shows you time and time again evidence of how global warming is affecting the planet and how our future could be if we don't do something about it now.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3C6X0DAM87GN4	Alex Udvary	"Are movies or documentaries designed to inform or entertain? That's pretty much been a basic question most people have asked. I bring it up again because in cinematic terms Davis Guggenheim's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" lacks but the message Al Gore brings to the table is essential.For those who don't know ""An Inconveinet Truth"" is a documentary which follows former vice-president Al Gore, who has been giving lectures literally across the world on the subject of global warming.Guggenheim takes Gore's lecture material and cross-cuts it with other footage of Gore and stats and pie charts. Perhaps I'm not doing a great job visually describing the movie to you. Or maybe it just doesn't sound all at that interesting. That, ultimately, isn't the point. Don't walk into ""An Inconvenient Truth"" and expect to be thoroughly entertained. That's not to say the documentary is boring. I never onced check my watch. I listened attentively to what Gore was saying. But Gore's main intention with this documentary is simply to inform and make people act after seeing this.I consider myself somewhat political. I've been interested in politics for about the last 4, 5 years. But I never knew until recently that the weather is a political issue. I knew Democrats and Republicans debate everything under the sun; tax cuts, health care, minium wage (although I don't know why!). But the weather? Who knew there was a Democrat response and a Republican response. I always thought it was a scientific fact global warming exist. I didn't know as some Republicans say ""the jury is still out"". But, what do I know I'm just a stupid 23 year old college student.""An Inconvenient Truth"" will be turned into a political documentary. But it shouldn't be. Gore isn't really blaming anyone for this problem. Yes, I admit, there are a few jabs taken at the Bush administration, but it's mostly done for laughs. Gore says it is up to all of us to help solve the problem. But, knowing what I know now, about the weather being a political issue, I understand this will be turned into a political documentary. And I also understand that a large amount of Republicans will not see this movie. Even though I'm young, I've learned something very important about people. Ideology will always trump facts. Have hurricanes been getting stronger? Have 10 of the 14 hottest summers been in recent years? Have glaciers started to melt? Have there been stories of polar bears drowning? The answer to all these question is yes. But, ideology trumps facts. If you simply don't want to believe in global warming all the facts in the world can be presented to you and it's not going to change your mind. This is sad because in the end the only people who are going to see this documentary are people who already believe in global warming. Gore's message will not reach anyone new.In the end ""An Inconvenient Truth"" is not a rabble rousing documentary the way ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" was. It lacks a certain excitement I admit. But people should see this because the message is so important. This issue will affect everyone. It doesn't matter how you vote. It everyone's problem. So inform yourself and go see it! *** 1\2 out of *****Bottom-line: Admittedly not as exciting as ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" but this isn't a political documentary and it's message is more important, because it goes across party lines.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AGEIT17HENDIS	Alfred Johnson	Yes, Virginia there is global warming. Yes, it is a human made phenomenon. And, yes, we have to do something about it, pronto. This film lays out the scientific argument for the observations that scientists, and others, have been screaming at us about for the past couple of decades. For that alone it deserved the documentary Oscar that it won this year for, of all people, Al Gore. However, more, much more needs to be done to spread the word, and do something real about the impending sinkhole. And that is the rub. The ruling classes and their hangers-on have severely downplayed the serious effects on the globe of current trends. There is no will to fundamentally alter the squandering of finite global resources, although there is plenty of talk.Those who have panned the film have done so on the basis of a political belief that god, technology or just hiding one's head in the sand will pull us through. Their main argument is that this scare-mongering about major planetary changes has occurred several times in the past and we are still here. That is a recipe for doing nothing and accepting that this capitalist-dominated world economy will find a way out. Of course by that time Kansas will be beachfront property. No, I will stand by the scientific method that underscores the intent of this film. Will some of the predictions prove unwarranted? Probably. Are there mistakes in calculations? Probably. But I like that way rather than depending on Exxon's, et. al good graces and explanations. There was a time when the ruling classes also aspired to use the scientific method to solve societal problems. That was the time of the classic bourgeois revolutions, when they were guided by Enlightenment principles. Now apparently astrology charts suffice.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AHF4XM2KAPX13	Allen	"I thought the documentary was great.  I still have questions - like why were there next to no hurricanes in 2006 and why are the oceans not boiling due to the current CO2 levels in the atmosphere?  Although I believe the information presented in the film to be largely true, I also believe the earth to be at least as complex as the human body - created just as wonderfully and intricately.  That said there are just unknowns about how the earth copes with stress (or doesn't cope) as there are with how the body heals (or doesn't).So I will set my questions aside for this reason - what does it hurt to be a good steward of our planet?  It takes a few extra minutes to put my recycling in the bin.  Even if global warming is a hoax, who wants landfills?  I do a little more research when I buy a car. But isn't that smart anyway?  And doesn't it benefit me financially to drive a car with higher gas mileage/lower emissions?  I spend an extra 10 cents on yogurt manufactured by a company that offsets 100% of its CO2 emissions.  But that yogurt also has no artificial sweeteners and no chemicals - isn't that better for me anyway?  I walk my kids to school.  Hello, heard of childhood obesity?  I reuse plastic grocery bags (and paper ones too, for that matter).  Isn't this just being frugal, thrifty and smart?  I buy ""green"" electricity from my power company - don't I want to step outside and breathe good, non-polluted air?The message here is that it is NOT DIFFICULT and NOT A HARDHSIP to be an environmentalist - or don't call yourself an environmentalist - say you are protecting the earth, helping to create a clean home for your family or being a steward of our greatest natural resource - the pale blue dot.  Each of us can do little things that take less time cumulatively than getting a haircut every 6 weeks, cost us very little and are directly beneficial.  In this age of instant gratification, it makes no sense to me why someone would not want the immediate effects of earth stewardship - they are practical and instantly beneficial.  Even if you don't believe the long-term gloom and doom, don't you want the immediate good parts of the environmental movement - less landfill, sweet-smelling air, exercise, decreased fuel costs, and health?

Clearly this was kind of a two-fold film--one for Gore to present urgent information about our climate crisis and how it will affect humankind, and two as a means of personal vindication for his stunningly baffling defeat for President. I won't go into the political/social ramifications on that score, but it is clear from watching the film that Gore wanted to inform the public of just what a great opportunity they missed by not having him as President. However, perhaps his purpose in life was not to lead the country politically but to lead us in other ways. The striking thing that stands out in 2014 is that the time frame Gore presents for climate changes is MUCH FASTER and SOONER than everyone is telling us now. I think we are being sold a bill of goods and we ought to go back and watch this film again NOW. Changes are happening at a greater speed than the news reports.	5.0	Must See	2014-05-24	0	0	0

He and is ilk love Computer Generated Models (CGM) but fail to understand the simple axiom: Junk in = junk out.  Algore and his followers love to make statements that Global Warming caused by humans is an indisputable fact put forth by a consensus of scientists. There is no such thing as consensus science. If it's consensus, it isn't science. If it's science, it isn't consensus.  The work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus--consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science, consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great, precisely because they broke with the consensus. These guys can't predict what the weather will be in 12 hours let alone, 20, 50 or 100 years from now--Algore, stop trying to snow us!  We're not as dumb as you are!Remember back in the 70's when the ""consensus of scientists"" made dire warnings of the coming Ice Age, and those that disagreed were called heretics.  They said there was no time to verify the facts, we had to act before it would be too late, or we would suffer this calamity.  Sound familiar?  The Earth is a living planet, with many factors we can't even begin to understand that influence the climate.  Before they make any more mistakes trying to mess with the planet, I would urge them to proceed very carefully.Algore gives new meaning to the term: a blithering boob.  His IQ is less than the square root of his shoe size, even though he thinks it's the square of his ever-growing neck size--and this from a guy who flunked out of Divinity school.  Yet he has the temerity to criticize President Bush's intelligence.  Does Algore have an MBA from Harvard?  Can you spell MBA Al?You just have to love the fact that he is making statements excoriating the Bush Administration's failures to address Global Warning from a private jet, so much for saving our planet, eh Algore?  How many 1000's of gallons of jet fuel were wasted polluting our planet in this film?  He & Bill did nothing while they ran the country, ""do as I say, rather than do as I do"" is their typical mantra, right Algore?

I suggest after watching the movie sending it to one of those people who claim there is no global warming because ""it's the middle of January and here in the Northeast it's 20 degrees today"" or the people who use claims (not facts) put out by major petroleum-industry companies and ask them to argue the facts of the movie.

Unfortunately for them, Al Gore got there first.On the face of it, the subjects this documentary presents really aren't all that appealing. It's on Climate Change Science. Presented by Al Gore. A combination which has the potential to be incredibly yawn inducing and unappealing. The kind of combination so staid that it would dissaude people from believing Global Warming even existed. It's one of the reasons why I've delayed seeing this documentary until this very moment.And I wish to God I hadn't.Because the actual result, considering its content, is an astonishing success. There's very effective use of slick montages, both of the effects of Climate Change, Climate Change critics, and the life of Al Gore himself. None of that would've worked so effectively, however, if the presentation itself hadn't worked. Much to my amazement, Al Gore does a terrific job presenting his case. He is so different from the lifeless automaton of the 2000 Presidentail Election. Here, he is passionate, articulate, and with a gentle sense of humor as well.In summary, if you're a Climate Change denier, this film is recommended because it's important to know what you're arguing against.

If all of us do something, the total impact will surely be great.- Walk when you can, change your car to an energy efficient car if you can afford it- Carpool as often as you can, or use mass transit- Change all the light bulbs in your house to energy efficient compact fluorescent bulbs-Turn down the thermostat by a few degrees, I have taken to wearing warm socks and a light sweater so I can turn down the thermostat-Switch off all lights and appliances not in use - like computers plugged in, other appliances, lights in a room when you walk out, bathroom lights, outdoor lights you don't need for ""security""- Switch all outdoor lights to solar, consider putting up solar panels if you live in a house to use that energy- Turn off the water when you're just brushing your teeth, or shaving and don't need the faucet to run- Refuse grocery bags when you can at the store, take your own bag or carton and bring stuff out in a cart and load that bag/carton. If you have to use grocery bags, reuse them as much as you can like for throwing out trash, so that you use some less plastic in a day- If you own a business, please switch off all lights at night inside the store/office - it always amazes me that in America we do not turn off the lights at night- Let's recycle all our trash as much as we can- Plant a tree, I think we should encourage everyone in our communities to have a tree planting day when we go and plant trees in areas around our cities-Support environmental initiatives, by donating time and moneySimple steps, but if all of us follow these steps it will create a snowball effect to start reducing our negative impact on the environment.Let's begin today!Edit - I got some negative comments on this review which say that the film is political propaganda. My point is that even if the film is political propaganda it did jolt me into realizing it was time I took some responsibility to protect our resources as they're not going to last forever.Film or no film, the fact remains that we need to think about our environment. We are part of a society and culture that loves to consume. Conserving water, electricity, fuel is something that you do in many countries out of necessity. In America, luckily we don't need to be so cautious as there is no such scarcity. Still, it is just good to be more frugal and try to conserve resources when we can. And even if there is a 10% chance that some of our actions will help conserve our environment for future generations then it is worth taking that step."	5.0	Great inspiring movie.

Since I live in a very isolated rural area that gets a lot of snow, owning anything other than a 4x4 is impossible, and they don't address the realities of rural living.  We don't have a bus line here, we can't walk to work or bike living 15 miles from town, nor do we have a recycling program; the nearest drop off is over 90 miles away.  However, we can lessen our electricity use, plant more trees and greenery, hang out the clothes to dry during the warm season, etc..

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3522F63VTYFKE	Andrew Field	This is an amazing film on many levels.  What makes this such a great film is that it is in fact a lecture on global warming, but done in such a way that it both conveys an enormous amount of information in an engaging and dynamic way, and provides a human context to that information by interspersing the lecture materials with highlights in the life of the presenter.Al Gore uses Keynote, a program that is Apple's equivalent to Microsoft's Powerpoint, but offers far sharper images and dynamic transitions.  This is emphasized by the huge plasma screen that Gore uses to project his images--if only my university had such screens!I originally became interested in this film after buying a Macbook and discovering Keynote--Apple's website has a brief intro to the film focusing on its use of Keynote.  As a professional lecturer, I was intrigued by this presentation tool and interested to see how a prominent politician would use it.Gore's presentation in the film is quite spectacular, and he must have received plenty of help in putting it together.  Overall one leaves the film with a much more coherent understanding of what is happening to our planet and what we can do to solve the growing crisis.  This film will hopefully encourage those who have had their heads in the sand to pull them out and confront the situation, and find ways to combat it.To put it mildly, hydrocarbon emissions, deforestation, melting glaciers, powerful storms, and eroding ice shelves all add up to a disaster whose proportions will make 9-11, Katrina, and the 2005 Tsunami look like minor incidents in comparison.  Gore uses statistical charts, but also amazing dynamic maps and satellite images showing the patterns of ocean currents, storm movements, and potential effects of rising ocean levels on the world's coastlines.  The visual effects are stunning and shocking.Thankfully the film ends on an up note, suggesting ways that we as individuals, communities, and nations can combat this crisis.  Here is my only caveat to the film:  it could have focused more on this final section, which in comparison to the rest of the film seems rushed.  And yet the ultimate message is clear:  do something now before it is too late.	5.0	A MUST SEE FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO UNDERSTAND GLOBAL WARMING	2006-06-10	35	25	10

He not only presents the evidence, but also presents proof to back up the evidence.  When I first saw that this was a video of a lecture on global warming, I thought I would be disappointed, but Al Gore not only makes the lecture enjoyable, he also adds in life experiences and puts a new light on the importance of our environment and the people who not only are here today, but will be here when our children are grown.This is not 96 minutes of lecture, it is a combination of facts mixed in with personal memories and experiences that may seem at first to be just propaganda, but in reality tie back in with the importance of Al Gore's mission.I wish everyone would watch this movie and recognize that as a whole, the people can prevent loss of life and prevent loss of resources and secure a future for generations to come.  Maybe it is too late to stop global warming from happening completely, but just maybe enough can be done to lessen the harmful effects and slow it down a little.My son is 9 yrs old and my daughter is 18 months old....I want them to enjoy the world as they get older and not have to deal with the mess that we have made.

What I did have a problem with is that he sure didn't talk about how cows make methane gas or how raising cows affects the land (yet shows his families farm land where they raised cows). This is just selective information. Just like farenheit 911, this movie only gives the viewer some information. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

It ignores any fact which does not fit the theory. Failure to address contadictory evidence brings the whole theory into question as well as the motivations of it's proponents. The only thing that this movie proves is the extent to which people will go to further their political goals.Yes, the planet is going through a warming cycle just as it has gone through warming and cooling cycles throughout it's existence. However, what we rarely hear is that there are several other theories for the reason this occurs.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A21U04RIT5AUDJ	A Reader with Gratitude and Appreciation	"I applauded what Al Gore did.  Should he have won the election in year 2000?  What would have the US and the world be like?  Was he that passionate about global warming back then or would he have been pulled left and right and not able to focus on the global warming issue if he were elected?One can ask many ""what ifs"" to that year's election.  One thing one can be certain is that what happened gave Al Gore the chance to study and travel the globe to speak and educate us this pressing topic that needs all human beings attention NOW.  I am thankful Oprah featured his DVD on one of her shows so to give me the opportunity to rent this DVD.To not spoil the movie for readers, I will only put the highlights of what I have learned.  Al Gore gave a presentation of what has been happening to the globe nowadays 1.) Climate change - Tornados, Hurricanes, Typhoons, draught, floods all because of the temperature change in the ocean 2.) The rising sea levels 3.) The destruction of habitat - e.g. Polar Bears 4.) How consistent the scientists have warned us about global warming issue.It is a persuasive and powerful movie to wake us up to do every bit we can to slow down global warming and going green.  I am glad Al Gore now brings it to the screen for us to view.  The most striking scene is about that scale of balancing economy and the globe from a nation's perspective.  From a personal perspective, it is about balancing our own bank account versus the environment we live in.  Yet, it does not have to be completely that way.  If we see renewable energy, fuel efficient cars, recycling (does not cost us anything to recycle other than taking the time to separate garbage), conserving energy (saves us money but we need to be aware of what energy we are using at the moment) as an investment to a greener, cleaner globe, it is apparent that everyone can act on creating a greener, more environmental friendly globe.  We all just need to do our fair share and be aware of the little old habits have to do to mother Earth.NOTE:  Al Gore has a web site that educates us how we can save energy in affordable ways.  It is worth reading and adopting some of his advice to our daily lives - many of his advice also help us save money in return!Watch the movie and educate ourselves is great.  However, what actions are we going to take now is more important than just watching and educating ourselves about the issue.  One can maybe argue the details and the facts.  But the truth is that global warming (in general) is real and it is happening.  So, I ask the readers, myself the same questions Al Gore asked at the end of the movie.  Do we want a greener world to be passed on to our future generations by doing our share?  Or do we want to carry our old ways of living and let our dear innocent children, grandchildren to suffer the consequences of our own actions?  We get to make a choice today and let us make one, follow through the choice that shows integrity and compassion to the worldThank you for reading my review."	5.0	An Awakening Call to All of Us	2009-02-17	12	5	7

The blog received the documents from an anonymous ""Heartland Insider."" Here's the inside scoop and more on Heartland:-Craig Idso, chairman of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change and other think tanks, receives $11,600 per month from Heartland.

Two anonymous foundations supply the NIPCC funding.-Heartland has a ""key"" anonymous donor who gave $1.6 million in 2010 and $979,000 in 2011.-Heartland's income totaled $4.6 million in 2011.-The Charles G.

The Koch family made much of its riches from fossil fuels and their foundation routinely supports conservative politicians and causes.-Heartland's proposed 2012 budget includes $75,000 to develop a ""Global Warming Curriculum for K-12 Classrooms,"" as proposed by a government consultant who wants to develop alternative classroom materials. Several states have introduced legislation that would give climate change skepticism a place in the classroom.-From Heartland's climate strategy: ""Efforts at places such as Forbes are especially important now that they have begun to allow high profile climate scientists (such as Gleick) to post warmist science essays that counter our own. This influential audience has usually been reliably anti-climate and it is important to keep opposing voices out.-Heartland has a right-wing agenda beyond climate change.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3C8F7MN6W6UN6	Au Hasard Jonathan	Hi, I lost an election, and I just cannot seem to give up the attention of people, because I'm basically a tool who needs approval.  I know, let's tell everyone that the world is going to EXPLODE AND MELT AND DIE AND BAM BOOM HOT WEATER IN THE FEBRUARY AND NO WATER AND MELTING POLAR BEARS.Feeding off of fear must be a fantastically divine way to get your kicks.  Hey, America, buy this, but that, recycle this, recycle that.  To what end?  Nothing, nothing at all.Global warming is a possibility, but not nearly to the effect that Captain Crybaby would have you think.  But hey, keep buying everything he tells you to, while he flies in an airplane and his son gets busted for whatever with whoever whenever.Basically, what it boils down to (no pun intended) is that humanity is not worth saving.  Don't think of the children, because, well, they're children and not worth thinking about.  Future generations won't care that you separated the paper from the plastics.Human beings are a cancer, an inexplicable, inexhaustible entity of consumption, excess, death and decay.  That's all, we're not even supposed to be here, we are a plague, from the lowliest bum, to the most well armed terrorist to the most noble kindergarten teacher.Don't stop global warming, don't recycle, don't bother differentiating between hybrid and SUV, because it's not going to matter.	1.0	It's the end of the world as we know it; and I don't care	2007-11-11	24	7	17
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1R602SXNGOMJ4	A. Vegan	Whether you're a fan of Al Gore or not, he isn't really the issue here. He does a great job presenting the various forms of overwhelming evidence for global warming and mankind's link to it, but he doesn't do it in a political or spiteful way. He shows global temperature and atmospheric carbon patterns, and he shows that our last 20 years have been the highest by a longshot over the previous 600,000 years.Even more importantly, it goes to show why we should care that global warming is occurring. As you may have seen in the trailer, if global warming continues at its current rate, the earth's coastlines will be flooded displacing tens of millions of people, it will increase the strength and frequency of hurricanes and tornadoes, it will irrevocably kill off many of the worlds glaciers, it will dry up lands interior to the coastline, and it will disrupt/kill species after species from polar bears to birds. These changes could occur in as short a time as ten to fifty years from NOW.Lastly, he finishes with ways in which we can affect a change. It would be easy to see this film, get depressed about all the state of affairs, and throw up one's hands in despair, but the film offers us ways, big and small, to help reverse global warming's effects right now.I urge you to see this film, you will not regret it.	4.0	The Sky Could Be Falling...for Real	2007-01-17	5	3	2

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3CTNILCZ3U2LG	"Barry Hampe ""Author: 'Making Documentary Film..."	"""An Inconvenient Truth"" is a pretty good documentary, although hardly Academy Award material. What it does well is to show us Al Gore as he travels the world trying to to scare people to join his brand of environmental religion. Yes, it's a religion: ""Do your believe in global warming?"" is the same question as ""Do you believe in God?"" or ""Do you believe in Santa Claus?"" It's asking, ""Do you take on faith the coming global warming disaster scenario offered by Gore and other proponents?"" It has to be on faith because the scientific evidence in Gore's presentation is (a) missing, (b) distorted, (c) half-truths or (d) outright lies. The facts of Gore's deceptions are well-covered on-line and in the one- and two-star reviews on this page.What director Davis Guggenheim does so well is show us exactly what Gore says and shows in his global warming presentation. Some examples: Gore says that a friend of his told him in the '70s that if the ice on the west shelf of Antarctica breaks up, ""that could be a signal for global warming."" A friend? Who? If this statement is important (and it, because Gore builds a whole inference system from it) the the audience needs to know who this friend is. And ""it could be a signal for global warming"" offers a weak inference, because ""Could be"" it's not.Gore says he went up to the North Pole in a Navy submarine because he wanted to see the Navy's data on melting of the polar ice cap. Apparently these data are kept in a file cabinet on the bottom of the ocean, rather than in the offices of the Naval Observatory in Washington, which can be reached by cab instead of submarine. (Gore lived on the grounds of the Naval Observatory during his eight years as vice president.)What Guggenheim doesn't do is point out the inconsistencies in Gore's statements or cite the opposing evidence.

"An Inconvenient Truth is as entirely simplistic and demagogic as the turgid slop created by the rabid and idiotic Republicans, it meanders along intangible lines until it attempts to gorge something into your face, namely that we'll all be dead in a few hundred years, which is already indisputable, but who cares, humans are selfish, destructive creatures, I frankly do not waste my time caring about human extinction. I'll just call it a ""natural progression"". Let the apocalypse begin, but meanwhile, we have to listen to the same brazen, slanted politicians who propose another ""new society"", well, don't be fooled, we'll all still be controlled by the wealthy, by those in power and by those idiots who created the catastrophes in the first place. Nothing will ever change.Al Gore, whose hypocrisy is quite evident in the film, as he is being driven in a gas guzzling car all alone using a consumerist computer, he also lives on huge acres of land in a rather large mansion, the land itself was used for destructive erosive purposes including cattle, tobacco, pig farming (which accounts for methane gas traces) and who knows what else, his wealth is predicated on exploitation, greed and his investments include numerous large companies in the world with disputable records. I hardly think this man is qualified to lecture the less fortunate, but his prestige is based on his opposition to another ludicrous political party, that is all, meanwhile he emits those very same rancid characteristics that make politics and politicians so appalling. This bozo happens to be living the comfortable life and yet he's lecturing poor people in Africa about crop farming and cut and burn techniques? He travels across the world in first class seats in fuel wasting jets, uses product placed computers in the documentary, and yet he thinks everything is a ""moral issue"". He's entirely absorbed in his own deluded nightmares, he says he came to these conclusions because of the death of his sister (from tobacco induced cancer and the near death of his son by an automobile of all things). Did he fight against the tobacco companies or propose that automobiles be banned because they are dangerous hulking machines? NO. Everything must serve the ""economy"", so why is he any different, the answer is he is not.His forlorn and exhausted attempts at humanistic philosophy are disastrous, all this while he's being filmed in the forest or along a little river eschewing stale life affirming quotes. Well Mr Gore, why don't you try living like the common people then? He is a politician, plain and simple, he has a career invested in the power structure. My question is, why doesn't he concentrate on the powerful industrial nations of the earth who are to blame for most of the complications? He doesn't do that because it would be unwise for ""investments, stocks and corporations"".Al Gore gives monotonous lectures about the subject in the documentary, namely to wealthy white people in the audience, who clap on cue, while showing them graph charts, numbers and percentages, and speaking in a dreary tone, no one without a Harvard (which the elites control) education can make sense out of it, but he tells us everything is going to hell. No kidding, but I think he fails to account for this problem precisely in the approach that capitalism has taken for the planet, namely that it is expendable and a waste dump. He never once mentions how industrialization has created these problems, he just wants to put mild bandages on them but not eradicate the whole oppressive system. Its obvious he was spoiled, sent to the schools for elites and has the same basic temperament for politics as any other back stabbing, inconsistent dullard in Washington. Whoever made this propaganda, as it is in no way different than what the Republicans have conceived, had only goals in mind that were directed by capitalistic impulse. That is to say, someone is going to benefit, and it seems the ""new green"" politicians who support venture capitalist companies who are buying up hordes of land in an attempt to develop the ""new Utopian future"" with ""new technologies"". It's the same old story, Al Gore is a believer in the elitist structure, he actually believes there is a ""democracy"" in the US which I find very naive. If we aren't paying our wages to the oil companies, then we'll be paying them to the wind and solar companies.I find the speech at the end quite rancid, along the lines of something GW Bush would have oozed over to the dumb downed masses, Gore speaks about ""people uniting together to defeat communism"" in the 1990's, what it had to do with global warming, absolutely nothing but he attempts to get base emotions ruminating in people. With that said, he didn't understand that communism never existed in the world, the systems in Europe and USSR were merely a tyrannical form of authoritarianism and capitalism, no less different than what controls the US interests. Social ecology was not even mentioned here, which is really a travesty. If you want to change the world, then one must dispose of those antiquated systems that are based on greed, exploitation and violence."	2.0	Same Meandering propaganda from Elites	2014-02-06	5	3	2

Even though he is less than intelligent, he was able to gather that the latest crisis du jour - especially with the college crowd - is the so-called ""Global Warming"" scam. Perhaps you're old enough to remember when these same Chicken Littles were crying that the world's temperatures were falling, and they were calling it, ""Global Cooling."" Robert Redford made a speech in which he whined that because of the earth's falling temperatures, all life on the planet would cease to exist long before the year 2000. Today, they claim the temps are climbing, and in the next generation, the Chicken Littles will probably come up with a scare tactic in which the world's temps are just too ""erratic.""The purpose of the Global Warming scam is to provide the federal government with more ways to tax and regulate the people. Even after the USA's unthinking, sheep-like people realize there's no such thing as global warming, the legislation will already be in place, we'll be paying significantly more in taxes because of the scam, and there will be no way to repeal the taxes once they're in place.But, if you try to persuade people to do their own research and find out for themselves how much of a scam this thing is, you'll only incur their wrath.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2K18EA1KL0DU9	"B. Byrne ""Celtic1"""	"Father of Climatology Throws Up at the Thought of Al Gore's 'An Inconvenient Truth'Posted by Noel Sheppard on June 18, 2007 - 11:46.Reid Bryson, the 87-year-old considered to be the father of scientific climatology, has once again spoken out strongly against anthropogenic global warming theories being regularly disseminated by alarmists in the media and the scientific community.In an interview published by Wisconsin's Capital Times Monday, Bryson spoke about the money involved in this ""religion,"" and when asked about soon-to-be-Dr. Al Gore's schlockumentary ""An Inconvenient Truth"" marvelously responded (emphasis added throughout):""Don't make me throw up...It is not science. It is not true.""But Bryson had loads more to say on this issue (better fasten your seatbelts!):There is no question the earth has been warming. It is coming out of the ""Little Ice Age,"" he said in an interview this week.""However, there is no credible evidence that it is due to mankind and carbon dioxide. We've been coming out of a Little Ice Age for 300 years. We have not been making very much carbon dioxide for 300 years. It's been warming up for a long time,"" Bryson said.Think Bryson will be interviewed any time soon by Katie, Charlie, or Brian? Regardless, the article continued:The Little Ice Age was driven by volcanic activity. That settled down so it is getting warmer, he said.Humans are polluting the air and adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, but the effect is tiny, Bryson said.""It's like there is an elephant charging in [sic, the room] and you worry about the fact that there is a fly sitting on its head. It's just a total misplacement of emphasis,"" he said. ""It really isn't science because there's no really good scientific evidence.""Just because almost all of the scientific community believes in man-made global warming proves absolutely nothing, Bryson said. ""Consensus doesn't prove anything, in science or anywhere else, except in democracy, maybe.""For the alarmists who love to depict every skeptic as being on the take of oil companies:Bryson, 87, was the founding chairman of the department of meteorology at UW-Madison and of the Institute for Environmental Studies, now known as the Gaylord Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies. He retired in 1985, but has gone into the office almost every day since. He does it without pay.""I have now worked for zero dollars since I retired, long enough that I have paid back the people of Wisconsin every cent they paid me to give me a wonderful, wonderful career. So we are even now. And I feel good about that,"" said Bryson.How refreshing. Can the alarmists in the scientific community - and folks like soon-to-be-Dr. Al Gore - claim that they are doing their ""work"" for nothing? Read on:So, if global warming isn't such a burning issue, why are thousands of scientists so concerned about it?""Why are so many thousands not concerned about it?"" Bryson shot back.""There is a lot of money to be made in this,"" he added. ""If you want to be an eminent scientist you have to have a lot of grad students and a lot of grants. You can't get grants unless you say, 'Oh global warming, yes, yes, carbon dioxide.'""Bryson then pointed out how the media work:Reporters will often call the meteorology building seeking the opinion of a scientist and some beginning graduate student will pick up the phone and say he or she is a meteorologist, Bryson said. ""And that goes in the paper as 'scientists say.'""The word of this young graduate student then trumps the views of someone like Bryson, who has been working in the field for more than 50 years, he said. ""It is sort of a smear.""Of course, then some ignoramus will copy the opinions of this graduate student and dissiminate them throughout the blogosphere as yet another example of the consensus. NewsBusters members should be very familiar with this:Bryson said he recently wrote something on the subject and two graduate students told him he was wrong, citing research done by one of their professors. That professor, Bryson noted, is probably the student of one of his students.""Well, that professor happened to be wrong,"" he said.Sound familiar? And this is why many view all of this nonsense as ""junk science"":""There is very little truth to what is being said and an awful lot of religion. It's almost a religion. Where you have to believe in anthropogenic (or man-made) global warming or else you are nuts.""Yep. I've witnessed that as well. Of course, what is the real science involved:While Bryson doesn't think that global warming is man-made, he said there is some evidence of an effect from mankind, but not an effect of carbon dioxide.For example, in Wisconsin in the last 100 years the biggest heating has been around Madison, Milwaukee and in the Southeast, where the cities are. There was a slight change in the Green Bay area, he said. The rest of the state shows no warming at all.""The growth of cities makes it hotter, but that was true back in the 1930s, too,"" Bryson said. ""Big cities were hotter than the surrounding countryside because you concentrate the traffic and you concentrate the home heating. And you modify the surface, you pave a lot of it.""Yet, the most wonderful part of this interview was:Bryson didn't see Al Gore's movie about global warming, ""An Inconvenient Truth.""""Don't make me throw up,"" he said. ""It is not science. It is not true.""Bravo, Mr. Bryson. And thanks."	1.0	Hooey, Father of Climatology throws up at thought of Al Gores Incoveinent Lie	2007-07-08	47	18	29

After all this is the same nut that said he made the internet.  This is not the voice of an a environmentalist.  Unlike Jimmy Carter you will not find him getting his hands dirty for his own cause.  I just have a hard time imagining this guy planting a tree.Considering his eco actions, his work is like a chain smoker telling a casual smoker they should stop smoking for fear of the chain smoker getting second hand smoke.  Al Gore claims to be an environmentalist.  But yet he won an award in regards to this documentary.  What does he do?  Well he takes a jet after the award ceremony to a big party which has dead animals flown in from separate parts of the world for people to eat.  Never mind that he could had festivities entirely prepared from a local renewable organic farms near by.  I am willing to bet he does not live a green life style after the making of this documentary.  The man could easily afford a solar / wind generating system that could keep his houses operational.If anything it seems he made this because he was not in the spot light as much as he wanted to be.  Plus he wanted to bitch to everyone about not winning the election.  So he thought up this documentary as the environment was a hot button topic to launch a `Look at Al Gore'.  After watching him go on about losing the election and his childhood I really could not watch it very long.  In part because I was afraid they would reshow the worst snore fest of all presidential debates (Gore the bore versus Bush the slow witted dimwit).Perhaps the most amusing part of the DVD involved a short cut from Futurama on the cause of global warming.My advice, don't waste your money on this DVD, go plant a tree instead.  Don't give this hypocrite a dime.I recommend reading:Forest & the Sea a Study of the EconomyThis is what motivated me to be more environmentally friendly.As for you nut balls that say there is no such thing as global warming.  Your nuts if you don't think what you do in life does not impact the planet.  The simplest of physics makes it very clear.  For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction.  Also considering the rising cost of gas in the U.S. I don't see what the problem is with finding a greener fuel source.

We hear all about his childhood, where he lived, his mom and dad, him, him, him. Why not just call this a bio pic? Why pretend that there's another angle here than Gore-o-philia? I was astonished to see so many clips of the 2000 election crisis as it had nothing to do with global warming, but it has everything to do with making Al Gore look like a rock star. An Inconvenient Truth is more a glossy series of sound-bytes than it is a work of legitimate science. This is the narcissist as confessor and preacher which are the hazards of having a politician function as a narrator.Furthermore, there's far too much emotion here which undermines the seriousness of the message. Comparing the threat of global warming to the Nazis in the thirties is absolutely ridiculous, as unlike with the measures taken by Britain and France in that decade, there is little impact that the United States can make on worldwide weather patterns. Even if we voluntarily thrust ourselves back into the stone age we will not change what India and China do to the environment. Educating the public about global warming is a fine idea, but stating that our present days are like those described in the book of Revelation are the words of a propagandist as opposed to those of a meaningful thinker.Gore's attitude towards his critics is both politically correct and disturbing. He condescends to those who disagree with him and sets up numerous straw man arguments to toy with rather than taking on tough positions. Global warming is an issue we should actively debate in order to increase everyone's overall comprehension. The last thing we need is a guy like Gore telling us just to accept his views because they are not political but ""moral and ethical."" They are not. His positions are political and we know this from the clips he shows of Republicans alone as opposed to those of Democrats. The Senate preemptively rejected the Kyoto Treaty 95 to 0 so its scuttling was a bipartisan affair but you wouldn't know that from this documentary. Bill Clinton's refused to submit the final version of the protocol to the Senate but that's also something that is never mentioned.Furthermore, if what Gore has to say is accurate then he should not be bothered by others trying to refute him. With the environment, we don't need conformity and acquiescence; what we really need is the constant exchange of ideas. His attempt to give viewers every answer is both cowardly and weak. There's a whole lot of self-righteous leftist personality stuff on display here and it grates. His narration was every bit as self-righteous and haughty as the man himself. He wonders why other politicians aren't as concerned about these matters as he is. Perhaps it's due to their wishing to deal with global warming as a logical problem rather than an emotional one. However, I'm sure he thinks that their lack of hysteria about the matter is due to their lack of goodness. What malarkey."	1.0	Al Gore, Rock Star.	2007-07-14	29	9	20

And if I had just watched this video I may have been skeptical of a one sided argument that was packed or spun for ulterior motives. But seeing the results here and now this becomes really spooky. The thing that makes Stephen King stories so scary is that he keeps them just n the realm of reality; so if there is any credence to the global warming we are now in the middle of a Stephen King scenario.The film is not just a scary we are doomed message but offers reasonable sounding practical alternatives.The first step in any action is awareness.What do you think?What will you do?Who Killed the Electric Car?	5.0	Politics aside, surprisingly well presented	2012-02-23	0	0	0

Smartly directed.Al Gore's never ending struggle to prove that mankind is destroying the earth and that the solution is international governmental control and primitive living reared its ugly head on the silver screen earlier this year and is now available on DVD!  Beware, though - that DVD is made of plastic, which is derived from a number of chemical compounds including - (gasp!) - oil.  The recipe for the movie, however, is 1 part science, 3 parts personal anecdotes, and 4 parts slideshow fun!Mr. Gore has taken the liberty of inventing a scientific consensus (this is, of course after he invented the internet) on which to start his new campaign for president.  His movie is almost entirely about his own life.  A fair amount is devoted to his current struggle to advance the environmental movement, and what is left over is a small amount of very misleading science.  It isn't, necessarily, bad science - it is just far from representational.  However, I won't waste this review debating the scientific ideas advanced by Mr. Gore - there are plenty of other scientists and resources for that.What needs to be recognized about this movie is that it is a campaign video and not an educational documentary.  There are components of informative dialogue and presentations, but this is really all about Al Gore, not global warming.  There is more discussion of how his political opponents have got in his way and in the way of his message than there is of actual solutions to the ""problem.""  This is my big criticism.  The movie masquerades as a documentary to advance an environmental cause when it really intends to advance Al Gore's availability for political office.  Even in that light it still operates dishonestly.Mr. Gore chastises the Bush administration for refusing to take action to stop global warming.  However, even when Gore was running the country with Bill Clinton, they did nothing.  In fact, Gore's proclamation in the movie that he tried diligently to get Kyoto passed but was stopped by the Republicans is bogus.  The Clinton administration found the protocol unworkable and challenged the fact that it only bound a few nations to action without timetables.  They never even submitted it to the Senate for ratification.  In this fashion, the movie continues with one dishonest claim after another.In the end, the movie is full of misleading science and statistics, complete lies and fabrications, and it focuses more on the nobility of Gore than on any perceived global issue.  The only thing that makes me give it a second star is the fact that it was smartly directed and well edited.  The message that the movie intended to convey comes across loud and clear and with style - it's just not a message that anyone should hear or trust."	2.0	I thought he already lost the election; why's he still campaining?	2006-11-19	103	11	92

Average it out and 3 stars is a fair rating for the whole package. That Gore has this compulsive need for constant self-aggrandizement and public self-pity is sad; it also detracts from an otherwise well-told and well-presented case for environmental action. That the Academy Awards saw fit to honor this with Oscar awards shows how totally out of touch with reality they are.If you want a just-as-compelling case without the Gore nonsense, I recommend ""A Global Warning?"", the History Channel documentary (available here on Amazon), which is easily just as good (arguably better because it's just as long but adds more substance to replace the histrionics found here)."	3.0	Very mixed bag	2008-03-14	9	4	5
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2ATWKOFJXRRR1	"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com"""	"Most Americans have heard of ""that Al Gore documentary."" Well here it is, AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH.If you've followed U.S. politics at all over the past 20 years, you know that Al Gore is the environmental poster-boy thanks to his take on global warming and other green issues. It wouldn't be difficult to surmise that his presidential run may have been hamstrung by this very topic. Big Business doesn't usually sit in the environmentally friendly arena, and Big Business most certainly contributes (via backdoors) to candidates financial checking accounts.For better or worse, Al Gore lost his presidential bid. The ""better"" aspect is that Al was then free to do whatever he liked with his life. He wouldn't be in the spotlight or battling legislators. So what did he do? He went back to his roots.An Inconvenient Truth, a lecture/slide-show Gore has probably given hundreds of times, would otherwise be pushed aside by politicians as an attack on industry if it were done by anyone else. But Gore's been on the inside. His science is strong and his data backed by nearly every scientist on the planet (note the word ""nearly"", as some simply do not agree, but the overwhelming majority - 90% or higher - do). This is an important fact, as scientists follow data, not personal beliefs or the S&P; 500.The entire documentary is about global warming and how amazingly ignorant or apathetic the world has become because of our reliance on outdated technology, our increasing population, and our refusal to change. The outdated technology is mostly about automobiles, since they produce the most greenhouse gas emissions. The fact that the world's population has gotten out of control can be seen simply by looking at various countries' census reports and then comparing them to agricultural and water needs. Our refusal to change is focused on throughout the film thanks to our reliance on oil, coal, and other non-replenishables.Al Gore has to be commended for doing such a great job on this documentary. He is the center of it, but he so effortlessly takes the focus off of himself and puts it on these hot-button topics that it's easy to forget we're learning material from a former vice-president. That was truly astonishing.Gore's passion for the global warming issues are admirable and most will probably be thankful that he's out there pushing this topic, trying to bend the ear of every person he possibly can. Make no doubt about it, he's making money off this project, too. But viewers would probably rather see someone as important as Gore making money this way rather than working for Enron or Exxon/Mobil."	5.0	"""That Al Gore Film"""	2006-11-29	57	33	24
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AK2XH0A7IIYKY	B. Mumford	"Unfortunately, you are either a disseminator of disinformation or one of the unfortunate individuals who have been duped by the ""corporatocracy"" here in America (and abroad). The evidence is overwhelming that mankind is exacerbating the global warming phenomenon; period--end of argument.Unfortunately, the reality is simply this--finding a solution to global warming would deal a fatal blow to the profiteers that stand to lose the most money (hence ""An Incontinent Truth"") while the rest of us, and our posterity, stand to lose what little ""hospitable"" environment we have left. It is bad enough that pollution and other environmental stressors have tainted our planet with disease, but what's even worse are the effects of the ever-increasing carbon emissions into our atmosphere and what they will do in the not so distant future (because of people like you [the naysayer] that refuse to admit or see the truth).If you have simply been duped, I hope you come around and peace finds you and your family as we stand a modicum of hope to overcome this impending crisis. If you are part of the false propagandists, however, then you are akin to a lethal virus that needs to be eradicated. That is not a threat--that is simply an analogy because, if we do not start seriously addressing the global warming issue, many of us will stand to be wiped out as the climate shifts at an accelerated and intensified rate. What perhaps you and others are insidiously trying to do is mix fact with fiction, exploiting the former with the latter by using a teleological fallacy which ultimately results in a very dubious and slippery slope which will have disastrous consequences.What's worse is that the plutocracy found in American and throughout the world will cease at nothing to protect their profit margins by paying off pseudo scientists to produce bogus studies which provide ""plausible deniability"" for companies like Exxon and politicians on the right (and left) in need of the political cover necessary to legislate and prevent laws to support the wealthiest 1% of our population.The power of the ""corporatocracy"" must be stopped, and it is not limited to the global warming phenomenon (albeit it is the worst problem of all). Their power is also the driving force behind the malevolent distribution of wealth and resources in society--a concentration of wealth that FDR fought so hard to cease and prevent for future generations; all of which came to a grinding halt after the breakup of ATT and Reagan's unwavering support of economic principles he understood little himself, but which had huge economic advantages to the overwhelming corporations that have grown up ever since and the individuals at their helm who profit from them the most).  These ""anti anti-monopoly"" practices continue to have adverse repercussions for the rest of us today--and the problem is only getting worse.Global warming, or our lack to mobilize efforts in opposition to the man-made and overwhelming portion of it, is simply the greatest symptom of a fundamental flaw in American politics...  the illusion of democracy (or rather, the illusion of a democratic-republic) here in the United States and in other ""democratic"" nations around the world. The power, both public and private, simply doesn't reside in the hand of the people anymore--that's the illusion--it really rests in relatively few people and families that pull the strings for the rest of us.The greatest cure for our problems, including global warming, is addressing the underlying political flaws which prevent us from dealing with them equitably and sensibly in the first place. To do that, we need to embrace the spirit of the 2nd Amendment so that we can bring something more than empty threats to the political round table--we can bring the reality of an armed citizenry that refuses to allow corporations (and government) to abuse capitalism in a way that runs over the overwhelming majority of people.  Conscientious capitalism can work, but conscientious conservatism, as practiced, cannot.I don't have time to thoroughly argue the 2nd Amendment portion of my argument here, but if you are a naysayer, I would admonish you to rethink your opinions in such matters as mentioned thereof and get on the right side of things with the rest of us--after all--we the people prevailed in 1776, so there is a good chance we may overcome tyranny again (wherever and whenever it exists)...Remember, global warming is symptomatic of a greater problem Thomas Jefferson often spoke of.  It isn't just the corporations; it's the banks (and specifically, the Federal Reserve, the private institution that heads them all--a duty delegated to congress in the American Constitutions which was later subverted by the Supreme Court).  Jefferson wrote...""I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks] will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.""Considering you really don't own your home if you have a mortgage--Jefferson was right.  What takes thirty years and two to three times the price of your home to begin with should take a fraction of that time and cost to your god-given right to own your home.  We'll never fix this problem, or global warming, without first addressing ""the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks]"" to begin with.But how is this ever going to happen if our politicians, and the heads of banks and corporations surrounding them, don't take us seriously?  If a British soldier knocked on your door in 1776, chances are that he would have a musket similar to the one you had hidden behind your door (and to the one that fired ""the first shot heard `round the world"" in Concord, Massachusetts the previous year).  Even though you would be outnumbered by the local British garrison, they would in turn be outnumbered by your neighbors (which made up the local militia).  The spirit of the militia is what has been lost since the American Revolution; and its loss is the cause of corporate greed, government intrusion, the gross maldistribution of wealth in this country (and around the world), and crime.  Thank about it; if everyone walked around with a sidearm like you'd see in some old western, virtually no one would consider perpetrating a crime against you (as the movie industry would have you believe).  Just as it served to subvert the Cold War, MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction), an ever-armed citizenry would virtually eliminate violent crime.  It wouldn't be necessary for every single person to carry a firearm (such as children, adolescents, or a habitual criminal recently released from prison); it simply require enough people so that the chances of someone concealing a weapon would be far greater than not.Like Jefferson and our forefathers, I don't advocate violence for ""light an transient reasons"", but global warming and other problems that plague Americans and citizens around the world (like the refusal for universal healthcare and terrorism), are so insurmountable that violence, or the threat of it, is sometimes the only way to resolve the seemingly irresolvable.  The only way to be a threat to the heads of corporations and opportunists in government is to ensure we have an armed citizenry--an armed citizenry that has the right to ""Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness"" afforded by the Constitution and guaranteed via the first and second amendments of the Bill of Rights.It's important that our citizenry can see this connection between:  global warming and other problems we face in the world, ""the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks]"", our government, the Constitution, and the 2nd Amendment within it.  We have the power, but human nature sometimes prevents us from using it.  Just as Al Gore uses the analogy of the frog in ""an inconvenient truth"", Jefferson mentioned our inability to use the power of the people in the Declaration of Independence when he wrote, ""all Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to suffer, while Evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.""  But he also immediately went on to say, ""But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security.""I am as ""liberal"" as the next guy when it comes to universal healthcare, protectionist measures to ensure fair trade (to protect both companies and their workers), and unions to ensure humane conditions in the workplace, etc...  but global warming is going to have catastrophic consequences if we don't quell this ""long Train of Abuses and Usurpations.""  To do this, we need to go back to the fundamental right to bear arms--that way we have teeth able to hold politicians and the heads of corporations accountable.  With embracing the 2nd Amendment and creating a culture of arms, we remain toothless in the flight against global warming."	5.0	To the Naysayers	2007-02-03	25	12	13

With that aside, this movie is a good one. Gore is entertaining, even endearing in some points, and passionate throughout.The substance is a different matter: Many of Mr. Gore's conclusions and  implied conclusions are factually incorrect, and some of the data he shows actually subvert his belief that rising temperatures are the product of  rising CO2 levels, anthropogenic or not. His sophisticated presentation is actually extremely thin on hard, scientific facts.I spent $20 on this movie, in the interests of listening to the other side, being entertained, and maybe having my mind changed.

Anyone who doesn't believe in this needs to come out of their house more often, or stop driving gargantous SUVs. Second of all this film is NOT a propaganda benefiting the democratic wing of the United States. This was a BOOK written by Al Gore. True he does crack some jokes based on his brief presidency, and the Bush administration. But the whole film is about his arguements and his stand point of the fact that in 10 years or so we will be experiencing ultimatal changes  in this world. I.E. polar ice caps melting, cities flooding, hurricanes possibly three times as powerful as katrina hitting cities like New York, Cali, Nepal.... The mainframe of this film is to explain the causes of using carbon based fuel. True that huge SUV that cost you like a 100,000 dollars is killing the ozone layer due to a little chemical called CO2  (Carbon Dyoxide) decomposing the bonded chemicals that make up the ozone layer. See im not going to go on this whole scientific explanation of this whole ordeal 'cause I know no one is going to listen. So instead I will put it like this, pollution is bad, someone wrote a book and made a film based of the side effects of the pollution we've made, little to no people are going to see this film because they don't believe its true we're heating up the planet (which is painfully dumb), or plainly criticize it due to their political views.

From an entertainment standpoint what can be more boring then Al Gore standing in front of an audience lecturing for 90 minutes.

The information about global warming is there but it is presented in such an analytical form that all the numbers seem to just not make sense after a while.  This movie also seems to be a bit of an ego trip for Al Gore.  Half the movie is about his personal life which I truly couldn't give a rats a** about.  Al Gore also seems like a bit of a hypocrite.  While talking about saving the earth, Al Gore drives around his ranch in a truck and flies around the world in highly pollutant airplanes.  I just didn't enjoy this movie.

However, his solution is not enough. For example he does not address the massive land,air and water pollution that the beef, pork and poultry industries perpetrate and thereby exacerbate global warming. As a politician, Al Gore is an admirable environmentalist. But, if we really want to curtail global warming, we have to do more than use alternative sources of energy and fuel. We have to change our diets and vigilantly protect marine and terrestrial ecosytems, biodiversity, rainforests, coral reefs and put an end to deforestation.

He agreed that Mr Gore's film was ""broadly accurate"" in its presentation of the causes and likely effects of climate change but said that some of the claims were wrong and had arisen in ""the context of alarmism and exaggeration"".In what is a rare judicial ruling on what children can see in the class-room, Mr Justice Barton was at pains to point out that the ""apocalyptic vision"" presented in the film was politically partisan and not an impartial analysis of the science of climate change.""It is plainly, as witnessed by the fact that it received an Oscar this year for best documentary film, a powerful, dramatically presented and highly professionally produced film,"" he said in his ruling.

I'm not a scientist so I can't speak of its scientific merit.  It's also obvious that the film makers have a political point to make.  But regardless of its scientific accuracy or political agenda what if the point that greenhouse gases are changing the climate is correct?I may not know the correct procedures on how to prove scientifically that the presicent Bush neglects the environment.  However, does this mean it isn't true?  Common sense says look at previous behavior.  Just because I can't prove how the internet works doesn't mean that it doesn't.  Common sense says it does.  So anyone who sits and waits for proof before taking action is someone who chooses to sit in denial.  I think that the comparison the film makes to the tobacco companies and their denail of the link between smoking and cancer is something to consider.  Why did we have to wait for concrete, undenialbe proof while so many people died from their tobacco addiction?Balance isn't the point of this film.  It's not necessary to hear opposing views to everything that happens in our lives.  Imagine calling 911 and the operator ask to hear an opposing view before responding to an emergency.  Imagine an EMS call...This is 911 what's is the nature of the emergency...My husband is trying to kill me...Well let me hear his side of the story before we send the police...Evidence does show that the Earth is getting warmer.  That in itself is scary.

Often during those winter storms I would wake to see the white wonderland covered with the dirty ash and soot that spewed from the pulp mill's stacks.  It was an awful feeling to see its loveliness descrated.

To begin with, where was this confident and charming Al Gore during the 2000 campaign? That election might not have been so close and with a different outcome had we seen him before. Also, if you have read the book, there is a large correlation between it and the content of the film. Mr. Gore stays true to the formula he uses in the book with alternating personal thoughts and vignettes with the presentation of scientific data. However, it is impressive to see some of the footage and graphics on film versus just photographically. Most impressive was the footage of one of the inland ""rivers"" that had formed in Greenland alongside the graphics and explanation of how these rivers were flowing from the surface of that massive Arctic island to its base, gradually weakening it like termites weaken wood. Finally, if you have a friend or relative who is open to the idea of the seriousness of global warming, but is just not inclined to pick up a non-fiction book on the subject such as Gore's and read it, the film is a good alternative.

Al Gore has neatly connected the dots over this 50 year span, but I fear that our wakening to the dangers is more than 50 years too late.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A35NFVV9QLIPOB	carnage	This review comes to you in the hope that it will find the place in your mind where rationality resides and where decency and sanity, coupled with a healthy sense of anger, will trigger appropriate action. For practical reasons, I have to confine my discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which I have something new to say. Forgive me if I ramble; I'm really upset, as I think you can tell. Believe you me, if you think about it you'll see that Al Gore's overbearing perceptions are merely a distraction. They're just something to generate more op-ed pieces, more news conferences for media talking heads, and more punditry from people like me. Meanwhile, Al's thralls are continuing their quiet work of advancing Al's real goal, which is to outrage the very sensibilities of those who value freedom and fairness.Did it ever occur to Al that maybe I am fed up to the back teeth with his hypersensitive asseverations? Dream on. Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Of course, if Al had learned anything from history, he'd know that he has become so hate-filled, so moved beyond the realm of reason, that I feel compelled to address the continued social injustice shown by ornery, impetuous harijans. But let's not lose sight of the larger, more important issue here: his inaniloquent, stingy treatises. Having said that, let me add that it would not be out of character for him to impose a narrow theological agenda on secular society. I'll probably devote a separate letter to that topic alone, but for now, I'll simply summarize by stating that the best thing about Al is the way that he encourages us to discuss the programmatic foundations of his self-indulgent disquisitions in detail. No, wait; Al doesn't encourage that. On the contrary, he discourages us from admitting that all of the bad things that are currently going on are a symptom of his insipid, self-aggrandizing subliminal psywar campaigns. They are not a cause; they are an effect. Thus, in summing up, we can establish the following: 1) I find Al Gore's apologues rather minatory, and 2) conventional wisdom states that he is surely failing in his legal and moral responsibility not to offer hatred with a pseudo-intellectual gloss.	1.0	complete and utter hogwash...	2007-02-16	61	9	52

As someone who has seen first-hand the side effects that global pollution can do and is doing to humanity, I have no problem whatsoever in believing the evidence that Al Gore laid out in this film.  I have always been very environmentally savvy, even as a small child, and of course I have done much research on my own, and looked at much of the evidence, even that collected by Gore's biggest opponents.Another wonderful thing I loved about this DVD was the packaging.  Gore definitely put his money where his mouth was in that regard as well.  Ultra thin, with minimum packaging, makes cleanup from the unwrapping that much easier.  Gore has even added a little something extra to encourage recycling, by encouraging you to ""pass on"" the DVD, so as to minimize the amount of pollution the extra waste (though minimal) would cause!  I thought this was a very nice, personal, not to mention perfect, touch to an already amazing film.I also enjoyed how Mr. Gore put everything in terms that an average layman could understand, using his well-honed southern charm and sardonic wit...as a private citizen, he has been able to do much more public service with this film alone, than he had ever been able to do, or could ever do, as a politician.This is a perfect addition to any dvd library, along with ""Who Killed the Electric Car""."	5.0	An amazing documentary	2007-06-11	8	4	4

Al Gore does an incredible job presenting hard, indisputable evidence for global warming. He not only discusses the science behind it, he also discusses the ramifications it can have on our society if we do not act.I also liked how he tied in some personal information about his life. It gives the viewer a better sense of how pasionate Mr Gore really is about the environment. I would have liked to have seen a little more discussion about what we as citizens can do, but overall, a must-see, captivating film.

There is very little, if any, factual, scientifically documented material in this film.  How dumb do you have to be to believe that this film has any value?  Please note that the film's premise is based on the ""Hockey Stick"" theory and sadly for Gore, that theory has been debunked - so his entire film is ""suspect"" at best.  The claims al gore makes in this film are so utterly stupid that it's almost a waste of time arguing them.  After viewing this film, you should demand ""scientific proof"" - do NOT be misguided into believing ""consensus"" - scientists must have documented proof and there is none in this film.  Yes, the globe is warming - it has been for centuries; it's also cooling.  So what?  Better to spend the money and power on something useful - like discovering a cure for cancer.  The scary part of this film is the unbelieveable ease that so many people accept it all as fact and refuse to question any thing the film declares as fact.

The average household uses 10, 056 KW of energy a year, and Al Gores house averages 221,000 KW per year, more than 20 times. He paid over $ 30, 000 for electric and Gas last year alone. He and his wife Tipper live in two properties: a 10,000-square-foot, 20-room, eight-bathroom home in Nashville, and a 4,000-square-foot home in Arlington, Va,  And he is barely at either!; God knows how much he wastes taking the private airplane around to lecture on conserving energy. His ""carbon"" footprint basically equals out to 5 normal peoples ""footprint"".He just won an Oscar last night, from Hollywood, which is also full of hypocrites. I bet you that if he asked the crowd to give up their Hummers and private planes and gigantic energy sucking mansions they would all turn away and sip their star bucks, but to ask ""America"" to conserve gets applause. It boggles my mind.I personally agree that we all need to do our part to conserve energy, use less resources, blah blah blah, but I cannot take Al Gore seriously, I couldn't take any politician or movie star seriously when their own private lives are the direct opposite to what they preach."	1.0	Blowhard	2007-02-27	120	57	63

This film does bring up many facts about how we can initiate steps to help our overall environment.  The problem is I keep seeing people isolate it to America, and the film seemed to do the same thing.  This is truly a world issue, so why isn't someone stopping China from putting in over 270 coal fired plants?  Unfortunately, as usual, the ""rest of the world"" is not on the same page and yet the finger pointing keeps going to ""Somebody who drive's an SUV"".  Of course then they say nothing about the fact that Mount Saint Helens put more destruction towards this problem than any car has.  Regardless, the future is now and we as human beings have a responsibility to do everything we can to save our planet, even though only small percentages are even trying.  The timelines and charts presented as well as the facts about moisture being lost from the soil were very alarming.  I think this would have happened sooner if some of the very supporters would stop trying to isolate blame so as to make political gain.  Al Gore stated himself (at the Grammys) it is not a political issue, but a moral one.  The DVD has some great features and is good at executing educational awareness at many levels.  I don't think it is right to be giving Al Gore the credit though.  The research and hard work that went into this documentary belongs to many people and Al Gore was nothing more than a puppet on a stage reciting statistics.  If you look into what went into this film, you will see so many faces and names of people who have yet to be given credit for their hard work.

He really dropped the ball on his global warming message by clouding the message with such nonsense. My question to Gore is, is he testing the temperatures of the ocean or the current political climate for a possible run in 08?Global warming is a natural process, and if you want to read sound information about global warming, see Peter Wards article in the October 2006 Scientific American.

All the profits received from this book (and the movie) will be donated to support efforts to combat global warming, so financial reward was not an enticement for creating this book.  Mr. Gore has devoted a large part of his life to politics yet this book seems hardly political.  So, where's his motivation?  I believe it is through a genuine concern for our planet and in seizing an opportunity to bring this important issue to the forefront of public discourse especially in this country.The book presents a set of undeniable facts supported by the global scientific community together with a plea to reverse our fate.  It is a call to turn lemons into lemonade and left me felling hopeful rather than depressed that we still have an opportunity to not only change our destiny but to find opportunity in making that change.  The end of the book sites concrete and practical suggestions that allow all of us a part in this grand plan.  I believe it's an insightful and courageous book and I'm forever grateful to Al Gore for sharing it with us.Update:  September 3, 2010I recently read my old reviews and realized the need to update a couple of them, namely this one and my review on Barrack Obama's book, The Audacity of Hope.I have no defense for publishing my pathetic review and nave assessment of this book.  I was duped into believing it was a labor of love, a product of altruism, a wakeup call to save our planet!In reality, Al Gore is nothing more than an opportunist, a scum-sucking socialist, a liar and a fraud.  ""Do as I say, not as I do"" is the hallmark of Al Gore.  Like Barack Obama and all the rest beholden to those who will not stop until the world is totally under their control, Al Gore has done us a great disservice.The Fourth Reich is upon us and our national sovereignty is dissolving at an ever more rapid rate.  A powerful group of international socialists together with a NeoNazi congressional delegation are in control in our country and represent an amalgamation of the Democrat and Republican leadership working in concert with a CFR infested Administration.For those uninitiated with the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), they are an organization established in 1921; they meet in secret and are represented by some of the most powerful people in our country.  Members of the CFR dominate cabinet level positions in federal government and many of our most powerful corporate boards.  The mission of the CFR lies in the establishment of the supranational state - one government, one justice system, one military, and one people - a world oligarchy.  Their membership and operations overlap with those of the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission.  Only one country effectively can foil their plans, The People of the United States, and we are going down fast.By the way, Al Gore is a member of the CFR.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A11OTLEDSW8ZXD	CGScammell	"If there is one thing Al Gore is passionate about, it's the environment.  His book ""Earth in the Balance"" and now this documentary are proof of his environmental concerns.  I enjoyed watching this, six years after this documentary was released, and would give this five stars if it weren't for the underlying political tone of this work:  bitter about losing the presidential election in 2000, Gore devotes his time to further support his data on global warming.  This alone would be fine, but the dabs against his successor, George W Bush, are for a bit annoying.  And I am no fan of GWB.This documentary feels like a small lecture on Global Warming.  Gore is on stage in front of impressive graphics or film clips that come across the screen.  His delivery is more animated than any press conference he gave as VP.  He uses layman's terms to get his point across.  The audience sits back and occassionally gasps in disbelief.Gore covers many topics that all cause the earth's climate to change.  The increase in carbon dioxide is one of them, but the increase in CO2 also causes ocean temperatures to rise, atmospheric winds to increase, and precipitation to alter its presence.  Evidence of more deadly floods, hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters such as drought and extreme temperature ranges in the first 12 years of this century alone should be alarm enough.Gore's disappointment in the US never signing the Kyoto Agreement is very evident.  But was is more shocking, taking the data in this document and the increase in more deadly storms and floods across the globe (and more powerful weather satellites and computers), is the INCREASE in former Kyoto Treaty signatories refusing to extend the treaty.  Russia, France, Canada have now bowed out, in protest against China and India not being signatories, either.  China and India's population are both increasing every year, and China's rapid industrial growth pushes it to the world's #2 polluter of atmospheric pollutants.The fear of global warming has morphed into climate change since this documentary was released.  China has become more economically powerful.  Still, this is a very powerful message to convey and a documentary that can still bring out debate among viewers of differing political groups.  Just watch this knowing it's been six years since its initial release.  Makes me wonder if Gore would change anything about this documentary if this were re-released for 2012."	4.0	Passionate and thought-provoking	2012-04-20	2	1	1

Does that mean that is was good on climate science but economically unrealistic?I'd like to see activist authors like Al Gore takes the gloves off.  He and others like McKibben say the world is threatened by the runaway greenhouse effect and issue a generalized call for action.  Instead, authors can try the approach of Saul Griffith and define how many hundreds of square miles need to be covered with solar thermal (difficult but doable);  how many new Generation III+ or Generation IV nuclear power stations need to be built.  Dire problems need bold vision.  If you want to be an authentic climate activist forget about immediate personal popularity.  For coal power station replacements with 24/7 generation, the author Reese Palley is one of the bold authors who show how the French energy model will realize a coal phase-out.	4.0	A documentary that raises awareness, and needs a sequel, ideally a sequel that is better than the original	2014-05-20	0	0	0

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A20BN9PWUU7ITV	charles peterson	I really did not know what to expect with this movie.  I am not an Al Gore fan, and I am skeptical of the hype surrounding the global warming issue.  I must admit, though, that this movie is thought provoking.Gore has definitely improved his ability to make a presentation.  He is much more likeable than during his presidential campaign, although I still had to wake myself up on several occasions to replay a scene or two.  He still has a tendency to treat adult audiences like a bunch of grade schoolers, and I did not think the side stories about his son's accident, his sister's health problems and the family tobacco farm added any meat to the message.The movie made a very emotional case.  On further reflection, however, it delivered precious few hard facts.  The warming statistics were totally illegible, and my understanding from others knowledgeable in climate change is that at every opportunity, he took the most alarmist position possible. He also never deals with the fact that only a few years ago, the same scientific community that today embraces global warming was scaring us all with the coming of the next ice age.Having vented all that, one cannot watch giant SUV's lumber down the highway or smokestacks dumping stuff into the air and conclude that they are good things.Overall, I view this movie as an overdone, light on fact mixed bag that, in spite of itself, has increased my concern about our environment.	4.0	Thought Provoking Mixed Bag	2007-04-15	10	2	8

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A160JN4OG2QMVQ	Charles Pooter	"Thank you Michael Moore; award winning documentaries are no nothing more than badly researched infomercials.I believe we are too wasteful, and have been messing up our environment for centuries, believing we are Lord of all we survey, merrily strip-mining, de-foresting and introducing incompatible species of flora and fauna in our imperialist mania. Yep, we bad. Evil, even. We should worry about the environment, but not the point where arguing about facts and origins turns you into a heretic. It ain't religion, it's science, people.That's what annoys me so much about An Inconvenient Truth: Al Gore ain't a scientist. Another reviewer compared this film to the Troy Maclure filmstrips in the Simpsons; Al Gore may know some famous scientists, but he doesn't come across as understanding what he's trying to prove with all his charts. He amazingly extrapolates the future for the planet from the last 15 or so years! He shows lame computer graphics of drowning Polar bears! He shows unlabeled graphs...to show us something alarming.The bad science I can take, as hey, maybe he's just trying to get us all inspired to do our own reseach and talk about the problems. But how can I take him seriously as he is shown driving around endlessly, going through airport after airport, lecturing everyone else about the damage of fossil fuels? Hey Al, remember that internet thing you were so big in promoting? Why don't you use virtual technology to reach out to people instead of burning up petrol and airline fuel? Practice what you preach, boy!The real flaw of this film is the Gore-abilia - what does his son getting hit by a car, his sister dying of lung cancer and the 2000 election have to do with the issue at hand? I always remind people in arguments to play the ball, not the man. Why was all this irrelevant personal stuff added in? It only served to make the film look like a Sovet-era propoganda film, or at worst, a 96-minute long ""those grapes were too sour"" lament.How this is deserving of an oscar (which went to the director, not Al Gore) or a Nobel Peace Prize, I don't know. Yes, you don't like who's in power, so demand a vote of no confidence, or have a revolution. Handing out awards to people who don't merit them is not the answer.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3V8OK5IQF626Y	Chicsea	In response to the opinion that the ice sheets melting would not increase the ocean level based on an experiment with ice cubes in a glass...that reasoning is faulty.The reason the water level in the glass does not change is because the ice cubes are already fully submerged in the water...so the mass is already located within the water level...i.e., the mass contained in the glass is the same, whether it is frozen or liquid. HOWEVER, in the case of the ice sheets melting in Greenland and Antartica, the reason the ocean levels WILL raise is because of the amount of ice ABOVE SEA LEVEL....when the frozen ice that is above sea level falls into the ocean, it ADDS water. That is why the critical areas are Greenland and Antartica, rather than the polar ice caps (where the ice is more of a floating pack of ice).Indeed, there is natural melting and refreezing of the ice which maintains the mass balance of the ocean. However, the current concern is that geological red flags are appearing around the earth, indicating that this process is no longer balanced...the concern is that ice is melting and breaking down at a rate faster than the refreezing process.I personally believe that global warming is a great crisis that we need to address now, based on my own research, outside of only watching An Inconvenient Truth.If you choose to believe otherwise, you are of course entitled to that belief. But please make sure you are more informed about the matter before rushing to deny something based on false analogies.	5.0	Think things through	2006-08-10	17	10	7

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A18G7GG53G2X8A	Chris Pandolfi	"It's easy to think that ""An Inconvenient Truth"" can't be reviewed without expressing biased political views. It is, after all, a film that speaks to those who care for the environment, something that's been subject to notoriously liberal causes. For some, the fact that former Vice President Al Gore hosts it will be enough to dismiss the film as nothing more than liberal propaganda. But the way I see it, a documentary about the reality of global warming is not at all part of a political agenda. How can it be when the facts and figures have been known and fought over for years? I think this film is about reintroducing the facts to the public, which in turn leaves deciding on the next course of action up to them. I found this to be a wise move on the filmmakers' part: it holds us responsible while at the same time invites us to be part of the solution.It seems that with the preceding paragraph, I've cornered myself into a biased mode of thinking. I guess Tom Hanks was right in ""The Da Vinci Code"": it all boils down to what you believe. Think whatever you will of me, but I do believe the environment is currently in a very real situation. I also believe that if we don't do something about it soon, humanity is going to suffer the consequences in the not too distant future. Of course, what I believe is still only an opinion, something everyone is entitled to. If the issues discussed in this film do not coincide with your opinions, and if you don't believe we're facing immanent danger, then it's probably best you avoid this movie (despite the incredibly important message it's giving).But if you're willing to take on a different viewpoint--or at the very least willing to listen to a different viewpoint--then I think seeing this film will be an invaluable experience for you. A majority of the film shows segments from a lecture given by Al Gore, one he had been fine-tuning for years. He gets the audience's attention by opening with ""Earthrise,"" a photo of a half-shadowed Earth taken in 1968 from a traveling space probe (famous for being the first of its kind). In that one picture, we get a distinct impression of how certain geographical features were standing the test of time; glaciers and lakes were of a definite size, and shorelines were seemingly set in place. As the lecture progresses, Gore presents more recent photos, ones that show these features changing. Glaciers are not as vast as they used to be and lakes are evaporating.But that's only the beginning. Apparently, the ten warmest years in history occurred within the last fourteen years, allowing for some unexpected behavior in weather patterns. In 2005, for example, the southern half of South America--an area known for having cooler waters--had its first hurricane. This statistic acts as a counterpart to the devastating Hurricane Katrina, which started out at Category One strength but increased to a Category Five as it passed over the unusually warm Gulf of Mexico. I think the most disturbing information pertained to the polar ice caps (Antarctica and the North Pole). Scientists took core samples and found that carbon dioxide levels are incredibly high, higher than they've ever been. This partially accounts for their gradual melting (more and more frequently, large chunks of ice break off their shelves and crash into the ocean). If they completely melt (which just might happen), the ocean level will rise twenty feet, flooding such heavily populated areas as Shanghai, Calcutta, and New York City.Weaving in and out of the lecture scenes are moments of personal reflection for Gore. He discusses the year in which his son was hit by a car. He looks back at his upbringing on a tobacco farm and how it contributed to his sister's lung cancer and eventual death. He even reminisces about the 2000 presidential election and his controversial defeat. At first I had trouble making the connection between these moments and the issue of global warming. But as the film progressed, it became clear that he was trying to make sense of his life, attempting to show what ultimately shaped him into the environmentally conscious person he is today. I see him as someone who passionately acts upon something he believes in rather than passively supporting it. At one point, he says that people often shift from ignorance to despair without stopping in the middle to do anything about their problem.It seems he decided to do his part by making the public aware of what many believe to be an important issue. But he didn't go into it blindly; he did plenty of research, gathering information from very reputable sources. In essence, that period had him behaving like a scientist, trying to prove a point through observation and the meticulous compilation of scientifically proven facts. He ultimately presented this information to an audience of environmentally conscious people, all the while showing animations and overhead projections to accentuate specific ideas. Granted, his style is less than charismatic, but facts outweigh style any day of the week. Besides, he's not above providing a few moments of comedy relief; he includes a very entertaining Matt Groening cartoon that humorously yet truthfully explains the global warming process.Suggestions for ways to improve the environment are mixed in with the end credits. One of them was to see ""An Inconvenient Truth."" True enough, I believe it's giving a message everyone needs to hear. However, it's not something I can push people into seeing. I can only recommend. In this case, I'm giving a very strong recommendation, maybe one of the strongest I've ever given. While you may not agree with Al Gore or the issue of global warming in general, it's too important a film to be overlooked.Having just said that, I realize that I don't know how many of you are reading this, nor do I know how many of you I've managed to alienate. But I do know this: sometimes we're given a wakeup call, and if we're particularly receptive, it'll change us for the better. This film may be one of the biggest wakeup calls humanity will ever get. For once, let's be receptive."	5.0	A Meteorological Catastrophe in the Making	2006-06-05	36	26	10
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AN9J46667D80O	"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?"""	"How one feels about this film is likely going to depend on your views on Global Warming Theory. It's a film that's designed to preach to the choir on the dangers of Global Warming, but it doesn't do so in the best way.The movie is entertaining. Al Gore, who I would've voted for in 2000 had I been allowed to do so, is a very engaging speaker, and I loved the clip from ""Futurama"" that was used in the movie.But there were some problems I had. The most notable was a shot of Gore standing front of a graph that, I think, was supposed to illustrate the increase in global tempratures. The thing is, there were no lables on the graph, and it was therefore meaningless.The movie also failed to answer some basic questions I have had about Global Warming Theory. Things like why temps seemed higher in the late 1930's and early 1940's, how many of our temprature records are skewed by Urban Heat Islands and the end of the Little Ice Age, whether or not an increase in global tempratures might actually have a net positive benefit to humanity as a whole (longer growing seasons in Siberia and Canada, for example), why we think the climate is PERFECT and should stay this way NO MATTER WHAT, and, most importantly, how can we possibly make accurate predictions on what the climate might be like 10, 20, 50, 100 years hence, when we couldn't even accurately guess what the 2006 Atlantic Hurricane Season was going to be like?No, this film didn't answer, or even really ask, any of these questions, and that's a problem for me. On the other hand, it was a fairy entertaining movie, and I've certainly seen propaganda films that were less entertaining (and have no doubts, this IS a propaganda film. It's designed to push a certain point of view. There's not anything neccessarily WRONG with that, but you need to keep it in mind when seeing it).As a final word, let me say that while I do remain very skeptical of Global Warming Theory, I also think it doesn't matter. Not even slightly. I think stomping out pollution is a worthwhile goal in of itself. I think the point of cleaning up our air and water should be to have clean air and water. Ultimately if we can accomplish that, then what else matters?"	2.0	I came in as a skeptic and left the same way	2007-07-07	19	10	9

Forget that polar bears are some of the world's greatest hunter swimmers on earth up to 200+ miles, and then you'll be able to cry for the ever increasing numbers of polar bears when you see one on a little piece of ice.Then ignore the fact Al Gore's been sued for all the lies this film contains and lost in court.Don't ask if He left out the largest green house gas of all ""water""  from his computer models that dwarfs CO2 by the billions because it wouldn't allow the results he wanted.Then never Google Climate Gate to become aware of the 1000s of hacked /leaked emails from the IPCC (which is the origin of Al Gore's fairy tale information.) where they discuss and worry about how to ""Hide the Decline"" of the actual data and how to ruin legitimate scientist careers who were merely discussing the true records,and how the data was being cherry picked further proving global warming was a hoax. I say was because after the culprits involved where exposed they no longer use the term global warming but have shifted to ""climate change"" thinking you're too stupid to realize climate is ALWAYS changing. That's why they're called seasons.A much better documentary would be The Great Global Warming Swindle.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AU503HFYAB0IG	"Christopher J. Benz ""CJB"""	This film benefits from a presentation that has been refined and developed by it's presenter Al Gore for over 20 years.It's visual presentation by reknowned director Davis Guggenhiem is spotless.There is a sense of incisive modernism to the direction, and it casts what is essentially a powerpoint file accompanied by Gore's gently witty narrative into sharp focus.For me, the most powerful aspect of this project, aside from the crushing facts of global warming, is Gore's selfless dedication to his topic. He quotes Winston Churchill at one point, and appropriately, because like Churchill, Gore's moral universe is simplified by one unassailable fact - he has a mission, and he will not ever stop working at it.There is a tendency to criticise a film of this kind by creating doubt about a detail of it. For example, why is Gore seen in the film in a number of vehicles including helicopters, whilst preaching that we should all lower our carbon emissions? And the fairly overt shots of Apple laptops seem a little insidious when coupled with the knowledge that Gore is a director on the board of Apple computers.To criticise in this way though is really missing the forest for the trees. A man does not devote himself to an issue with this much passion for 4 decades just to draw attention to himself, and anyone looking into Gore's eyes can tell that he means what he says. Gore is far from an attention seeker; his presentation is a very sophisticated attempt to blast through the barriers of doubt. In fact this film shows how he spends an almost equal amount of time studying doubt and how to tackle it, as he does researching the science itself.My only quibble with the film is most probably a fault of the producer/directors in the mercifully few moments where we step outside Gore's presentation to study Gore himself and the shards of his life which intersect with the issue of Global Warming.Although these moments are in their own way, powerful and sympathetic, they also form a platform upon which the film can be superficially criticised (ie that he's just trying to draw attention to himself after losing an election, or that he's attempting to politicise science etc) and moronic as these criticisms may be, the film was better off not entering into the personal realm of Gore in my opinion. That could perhaps be another film. This film is and must be soley about the Earth, and the problem that confronts it.In short, this is a powerful, deeply human experience and one that leaves it's audience immediately inspired to do what we can for our beautiful home. I hope it is seen by as many people as possible and that they open their hearts and minds to it.	5.0	Inspiring and enlightening insight into the future and the past	2007-05-02	14	7	7

Would it be as boring as most monotone lectures are?  And, will it satisfy MY demands for evidence?  When the DVD arrived from amazon, I was taken aback by the packaging.  Which is nothing like what the image on amazon represents itself to be, as its not the typical plastic DVD case with a cardboard box slip cover.  The package could best be described as a greeting card with a slot for the CD.  Don't let this discourage you, the case is made from 100% recycled material and is really small and light weight.The movie opens with a beautiful and serene nature scene which has a strong relaxing effect.  Gore puts forward a convincing argument, and lays out the scientific evidence in such a way that the truth is inescapable.  Using iWork Keynote, Gore built a beautiful keynote which helps the data come alive.  At no time was I bored during this 1.5 hour movie, not once.  In fact the ending came upon me suddenly.  There can be no question about it, no doubt remaining to the question of Global Warming, once this presentation is viewed.When I was in grade school (I'm 27 at the time of this writing), I was taught that Global Warming was a threat, but that it was a threat posed to successive generations.  A lot has changed since the late 80's early 90's.  With the new scientific data propagating from all over the globe, it's conceivable the next generation will have severe difficulty surviving on this planet if we don't change NOW.  The evidence presented by Gore is as irrefutable as the Holocaust and even more foretelling.Thank you..... President Gore.	5.0	Thoroughly Engaging and Over too Soon	2010-10-01	0	0	0

Not getting an encouraging response, the kid becomes a drug addict and the teacher becomes an advisor to the ""present administration."" Shortened, but you get the idea, non-enlightened people need not apply.) Why was this partisan comment necessary, right at the start!

He comes darn near claiming that he himself is a scientist and that he invented the whole thing. At one point, he looks out the window of a private jet, peers affectionately at earth and pronounces how he has spent a life-time studying the earth. Wow, and I thought he was busy inventing the Internet.Then there is that Simpson cartoon about moonbeams. What does he think that the audience are imbeciles or babies? Why the cartoon? To top it all off in the general scattered vent, he then goes on to play the they-stole-my-presidency song to a happy audience who clap like 3rd graders.

Craftsmen do not hope; they merely make something, and sell it.A craftsman would be a music group like the band ""Hot Hot Heat.""They make a song, they make it so someone can listen to it, jump around to the beat of the song, relate to the lyrics on an emotional and philosophical level, and feel an emotion as an effect.One could use the verb ""hope"" in terms of a craftsmen in that, ""They hope someone will like their song, and buy it, and that they can be famous, so they can have sex with lots of pretty girls who like to jump around to the beat of their music,"" but that would be not my useage of the word hope. I would say, ""A craftsman wants someone to like their song, so they can get paid, and do what they like to do with their life."" This is no different than Apple computers making their iPods the coolest and smallest they can make them. ""Hot Hot Heat,"" whose music is quite fun and cool, and deserve all the pretty girls they can get, makes their songs as fun and cool as they can make them.It is NOT more vain that they just want someone to like thier song, it is NOT immoral ; it is what most people do ; but it is without hope.All men need hope. Artist and craftsman.I need hope, and that is why i will remain an artist.Craftsmen find hope through other means.But an artist, through what he creates, hopes.Every sentence, note or brushstroke he produces can be translated to: i hope.What does he hope for ?An artist hopes for change.An artist hopes one who experiences what has been created he or she will not be able to live their life the same way after the fact.An artist does not necessarily try to create beauty, he does not necessarily try to create truth, he does not necessarily try to soothe OR stimulate ; an artist could chose any of these things, or he could chose none of them, but he choses them to hope for change.Sometimes, this is small change in one's life. For example, the famous William Carlos Williams poem:so much dependsupona redwheelbarrowglazed in rainwaterbeside the whitechickensNow that you have read that poem, your life will be different in a very small way. You might say the word ""chickens"" with a slightly different feeling for the word. You might see red as a little more of an interesting color. You might notice the weight of the things you say, the heaviness of the syllables, the heaviness of the thoughts they bring, or you might just every so often mutter to yourself, ""Beside the white chickens,"" because it has a pleasing sound to you.Williams does not care if you ""like"" his poem, if you would pay five dollars to have it read to you--for proof, read his collected letters to publishers. You may end up paying five dollars for it, but that is not his concern. He wants you to be different, he wants to toss you into the horror of his world, and make you understand it. He wants change.An artist is a terrorist.I paid five dollars today.I saw An Inconvenient Truth.It was art.It was a kind of art i do not often view, It was art whose materials were equal parts science, drama and truth.Like Williams' poem, it was hoping.But it hoped far beyond anything Williams ever wrote.It hoped with a child's mind, it hoped with a purity and a logic.And it changed me.I don't know who else in the small small matinee audience it changed, but i hope it changed everyone in there.I cannot go on living my life in the same way.I mean this with sincerity i rarely know.I am weary with catharsis, i have cried and i have raged and i have hated, and now i am ready to move on.I am ready to be someone different.Starting with these words.I hope you liked this review, and i know there are many reasons why you might not.For example, the style is very plain and may come off as careless ; and its logic might seem ill.But this review is art. To me.You may decide if it is bad art, but it will still be art. Because i wrote this with the hope that you will be changed after reading it, and you will go see An Inconvenient Truth tonight at seven at your local theater, instead of the Da Vinci Code, instead of Mission Impossible Three, instead of Garfield: A Tale of Two Kittens, instead of even another movie i have given a rave review in the past.

I remember a National Geographic article (1980) that showed that most of the oil fields were going to be drained or mostly gone by the year 2000. And yet the more I learn about our oil reserves its pretty obvious that the media and government are engaged in a conspiracy to lie about how much oil we really have, which by the way is more that Saudi Arabia.Remember in 1993 when on Larry King Live, Saint Al of the Gore said that NAFTA ""is a good deal for this country"", and a $1 billion trade surplus turned into $75 billion trade deficit. Some good deal - thanks a lot Al. Look what happened to Detroit. You think the economy is bad now wait til Cap and Trade kicks in. The end of industrial America. By the way, Al Gore and his partners own the company you'll pay your carbon offsets too, Al stands to make billions.Go ahead and watch it, but when watch 'The Great Global Warming Swindle' and compare.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"In a weird way, the title, ""An Inconvenient Truth"" fits perfectly how certain people see big concerns and social concerns even though it's an awkward and clunky title to say. Like Bill Maher said once at Just For Laughs, President Bush standing in front of a tree once a year saying ""I like the environment"" does not make him a crusader for global awareness. Al Gore though has been actively pursuing the need for a bigger awareness among the world to slow down and eventually stop global warming. While Gore certainly had his share of jokes during the 2000 Election, namely a monotonous speaker, here he's actually a bit captivating as he gives a presentation to a group of people about where we were, where we are and where we're going.The film largely centers on Gore's presentation, or as he calls it, his ""slide show"", where he shows with graphs and charts mounting evidence that the world is on its way to global warming. While Fahrenheit 9/11 seemed like a big budget rant you'd see on blogs where they're trying to make us see things his way, Gore just shows us what the facts are and is passionate about what he's saying. And unlike lecturers I've seen where they spend so much time talking in science speak and you have no idea what they're saying, him and his arsenal of slides lets you understand just how the environment is changing.Intercut with this is basically the ""Gore at Home"" scenes where he narrates things about his life such as the near-fatal car accident of his son to the death of his sister. While it does give a needed break after so much explanation and facts, it also slams the brakes on the pace. You're getting so caught up in the fact that Japan had a record number of typhoons in one year only to have it slow down with melancholy acoustic guitar as Gore narrates about his life. The film's more effective in showing his passion for his cause in the lecture rather than a bit of griping about him losing the election.Now as for the issue, I for one do feel sometimes like the issue just seems too big to handle. Yes, we do recycle, and I actually don't even own a car and spend most of my time walking or riding the bus(and this is Canada where -30 Celsius in the winter is considered a good day) but at the same time it feels like ""me and a large group of people are going to save the world"". Sure it can be done but it just feels like this huge project to start. Also Gore himself doesn't even offer any suggestions in the film. He does an effective call-to-arms plea about taking action and saying ""we can do it"" yet he doesn't say how. All that comes during the end credits and they ask to use different light bulbs and we should recycle. Um....recycle? ""Alright ladies and gentleman here is your mission: we're to save the Earth from global warming. Our battle strategy: recycling."" Seems strange.It's probably one of the best social issue films I've seen but also one of the more flawed but just strictly based on facts and projected figures, it's certainly a bit scary."	5.0	Powerful and informative without never being preachy	2006-11-22	10	6	4

Based on a lecture warning people about global warming, Gore's passion to make people understand what is at stake is heartening.In his dry, matter-of-fact manner, Gore takes on the Bush administration for a deliberate misinformation campaign to confuse people about global warming.  I doubt that anyone would even attempt to refute Gore after seeing all the evidence he has presented so clearly.  If we continue our present deadly inaction to address these concerns, we can no longer plead innocence after seeing this movie.Gore's passionate concern about the state of our planet comes through as he shares moments in his personal life that have shaped his commitment to saving our ozone layer.  He makes a compelling case, also, that we must end all warfare.  I literally basked in his words, loving every minute of this movie as Gore said everything that I've been saying for years.If I had the means, I would cross the Arctic and Antarctic the way Gore did, to see for myself the extent of global warming on the icecaps.  The footage he shares of glaciers calving, receding, crevassing, and other manners of disappearing, satisfied me completely.  No questions left - we are in a serious planetary crisis with global warming and we must do something about it.I support Gore fully in creating the necessary political will to take all the steps he suggests for people to change the way we live to minimize global warming. - Ariel Ky"	5.0	Great footage of glaciers calving, receding, crevassing	2006-07-24	30	22	8

But go with an open mind, don't be afraid to question your assumptions and the movie's assumptions....just don't hide your head in the sand or pretend that you already have the answers. Being confused is human, but giving up on learning is a form of death.  Engage yourself, and engage these ideas.Yes, the vast majority of scientists and scholars have no question that global warming is occuring and that the earth is changing dramatically and dangerously.  They also largely agree that if we reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, develop alternative forms of energy (sun and wind, among others) and take  steady steps towards conservation and recycling, we can manage the potential nightmare ahead. But there is room for you to have your own thoughts and opinions too, just make sure those opinions are formed by discussion (especially with those who may disagree) and curiosity and openness.It is the closed minded among us who are in truth making the world a more dangerous place, whether it is the islamic fundamentalists or the opinionated commentators whose minds cannot think beyond there own long-held prejudices.

I can, however, write about the impact this film has had on myself and my family (which is something I don't think too many of the other 800 reviewers know).  So here goes:I saw this film initially in the theater, more out of a sense of duty and obligation (my mom wanted to go) than a sense of imminent entertainment.  I mean, I didn't exactly mind Al Gore going in, but I didn't necessarily consider him to be the most compelling figure the world (let alone the movie world) had to offer.  But the movie, surprisingly, had me captured and enraptured, and Al Gore was actually engaging and, dare I say, entertaining.  What happened to the old, stiff and dull Al Bore I once knew and felt so apathetic about?  Apparently, greenhouse gasses have not only warmed up the globe but have warmed up old Al as well.  Nice to see.At the closing credits, everybody applauded and filed out to their SUV's.  My mom actually made a cell phone call with her car idling in the parking lot, so I guess the projected satellite shots of her Florida beach house being inundated by the ocean didn't affect her as much as I would have thought.  But I immediately went home and logged on to the movie's website (listed in the closing credits) and have been following its steps to reduce my ""carbon footprint"" ever since.  Plus I bought a copy of this DVD to lend out to family members (who didn't feel as obligated as I did to accompany Mom to this movie, apparently). And their reactions have been even more striking:My usually materialistic-at-any-cost sister was very moved and is now acting more to preserve a better world for her son than to fulfill her every consumer comfort need.  And my brother-in-law, even more shockingly, was affected too; being a germophobe, he was horrified to see the effect atmospheric warming has on the creation/incubation of newer forms of various microscopic bio-nasties (note: this is not the technical term, I don't believe).Suffice it to say, this movie is surprisingly entertaining and actually can move skeptical people to make some positive changes in their daily lives.

Nothing against Moore, but Al Gore looks at solutions rather than place the blame on one man or small group. Gore explains the basic facts of how global warming works and has gathered some fascinating pictures and slides of the earth; the filming of this picture was at times breathtaking. He also describes his early years on his father's tobacco farm, and how his sister died from lung cancer. Although he has gone through years of heartbreak and defeat, this film is a huge victory, as Gore seems refreshed and positive, and whether or not you like his politics, he is in fact a brilliant man, deeply committed to getting his message out and making the United States a great place to live. And this is a brilliant documentary that delves deep into the prospect of global warming and the threat that we all face. Moreover, it is our responsibility to clean up our messes and leave something behind for future generations. Even Bill O'Reilly has recently stated that global warming is a threat that ""is real and should be taken seriously."" And I respect his opinion. And I now have new respect for Al Gore. I am also glad that Gore waited until after the midterm elections to release this on DVD, because it was not in many theatres and this type of movie could influence an election particularly in the wake of hurricaine Katrina. Each year that goes by, new evidence comes forward that makes Gore seem more like a genius than a radical advocate for this stuff. What evidence has ever been produced that can prove Gore is wrong?

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3SFO2GSP5CVSM	"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom"""	Let me state, up front, I have never been a fan of former Vice President Al Gore. He was a right of center Democrat who worked in an administration whose environmental record was considered, by most ecological groups, worse than the two Republican administrations that preceded his, and held that office at a time when the earliest stages of global warming, which he now decries, were first becoming known. As the second most visible politician in the country, did he sound the alarums then? Well, no. He wrote a book or two, but did nothing of any real consequence with the power he had. However, his Johnny Come lately status as an environmentalist, which led to his winning of the Nobel Peace Prize, as well as an Oscar for the 94 minute 2006 documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, has nothing to do why it's a bad film. That's due solely to the film's director Davis Guggenheim, most noted as a network television director.... The film is basically two thirds of Gore preaching to the public about global warming by giving a slide show with some neat graphics. Again, the vast majority of what he states is incontrovertible, and the few areas where he exaggerates are minor disagreements between the scientific community where he chooses the worst scenario for dramatic effect. This is forgivable on Gore's part, and even the filmmaker's. It is also quite effective. But, where the film tanks, and also goes way beyond any reasonable standard for calling itself a documentary, is in the interspersed other third of the film, where we get the fetishistic close-ups of Gore as saint aborning, and in the hamhanded voiceovers. Putting aside the fact that the writing of the voiceovers is cringe-inducing (see above), Guggenheim could have at least put on a patina of objectivity by having the voiceovers done by someone else- perhaps another Left Winger like Tim Robbins. Instead, we are left with the unseemly deification of Al Gore....by Al Gore!Even worse we get a parade of Oprah Winfrey-level sob stories about how tough a life Al Gore has- being born with a silver spoon, political power, and the disappointment of being out-scioned by George W. Bush for the Presidency. There are some genuine bad things that the film inexplicably digresses to, such as his sister's death from lung cancer and his son's near-fatal car crash. So? I mean, what is the point of the film- to act as a documentary about the global warming crisis, or about Al Gore's `indomitable courage'? Such courage which propels him to `walk alone' in airports- as if he's just a `regular person.' Or to spend hours on his laptop computer monkeying with graphs. Ooh, he's deep. Yup. Yes he is. Yessirreebob! But, if Guggenheim could only stop with the up the nostrils viewpoint so many of his shots have. I mean, even if Al Gore is the greatest man in the history of our species, do we really need to be able to count his nose hairs?....Overall, An Inconvenient Truth has important ideas, but is a bad film precisely because those ideas are made secondary to the ego of Al Gore. That is not Gore's fault, but Guggenheim's, yet is precisely why An Inconvenient Truth is a bad film, and not even remotely a `documentary.'	2.0	Ugh	2008-09-07	16	10	6

Its here, its been well proven, get over it.The film generally makes an excellent presentation of the science surrounding global warming. But there are a few scenes which I think detract from the overall impact of the film.- There's a scene dramatizing Gore's presidential loss. This is totally out of place in the movie and unnecessary. This diminishes the value of the movie as many republicans will see this as evidence of a liberal bias and use it as an excuse to ignore the overall message of the movie.- The movie had several scenes that were overly depressing. Gore's 6 year old son almost died when hit by a car, and his sister died of lung cancer. And this has what to do with global warming?- At one point I think the movie is trying to make a statement about how warming is worsening disease. Starts out talking about mosquitos moving to higher elevations because of warmth. That progresses naturally to talking about mosquito born illnesses, but then suddenly the movie is listing all sorts of new diseases that have emerged in recent years that have nothing to do with global warming. The worst one mentions bird flu. This is one case where global warming could actually help. Flu outbreaks are usually milder in warm weather, yet the overall tone of this scene blames all new illnesses on global warming. Thats very misleading.But again, overall, on balance its an excellent must watch film.	4.0	Great content with a few flaws	2007-01-14	3	1	2

Well this movie tells all the consequences of the following questions in a very down to earth easy to understand manner. I remember myself being a small child in the 80's, now 31 i look back and wish winters were like they use to be, beautiful fall leaves(here in West Virginia) some of the prettiest anywhere would flourish again. Unfortunately that doesnt happen anymore. Instead my once beautiful state is now plaqued with overheated winters, deadflowered springs, painfully humid summers and rainy dryed up brown leave falls. Not to sound like a poet here or anything but this is really how i feel, i feel as though we have been raping, thrashing, and just down right murdering our mother earth. This is our home folks and if we don't have it we can't just up and move to another house or apartment building, let alone another planet. Al Gore has never been my particular favorite when it comes to political icons so to speak. I always took him for another Bill Clinton, but in seeing this film i can see he is quite noligeble about the issue and has basically devoted his life to the whole cause. Gore may be a sore loser, but hey what if you were running for the President of the U.S and lost, would you just gradually take defeat and never speak of it again, i think not.In this film we see a lot of great scientific proof that the earth is ""heating up"" literally. As a matter a fact you don't have to be a scientist, climatologist, or evironmentalist to see the weather has taken a crazy turn for the worse. Not to give to much away i literally gasped(as did my fiance') when we saw the statistics of Carbon Dioxide and the Thickening of the outer atmosphere that traps in radiation from the sun. That said we ourselves started to actually wonder about bringing children into a world where they may or more realistically may NOT have a future, and if so a very fierce unlivable one. So with this comes the question are we prepared for whats ahead, does the republican party really care? Does congress give a damn, or will they just sit back and watch as the earth self-destructs like a giant dissolving piece of paper in a scortching fire? My father who happens to be a coal miner heartely agrees with gore in that they should be shut down, as with vehicles, factories, deforestation, and even simple aerosol cans that can simple eat away at the environment.

WHY NOT SEEING THIS FILM IS AN ACT OF RECKLESS APATHY.1)The film presents the most blatent, graphic, carefully justified, cogent argument for the reality of Global Warming.2) Gore demonstrates what public service is: putting moral convictions before potential considerations of public response, basing those convictions on criteria of an unqualified other-regarding ethic, justifying those convictions with facts, presented in a clear, easily comprehensible fashion.Although the action is generated from a classroom type scenerio, not the most exciting of venues, the big fact is that most Americans (and the World Population en totem) either don't know what Global Warming is or, if they do, do not understand it.Bluntly - the apathy has been cultivated by those who somehow consider their self-interest morally and materially inviolate in an age where the only talking to power which is heard and felt is done by money.Further, thanks to the wonderful corporate media interest et al, most Americans under age 40 (and many over) seem to have no idea of what democracy is - or to have forgotton.Gore reminds us in this gutsy, information packed performance, that participating in a democratic society requires first that we get informed about the issues, that we have the courage of our convictions, and, at long last (at the least) that we act on them.While I will never quite forgive him for his support of NAFTA,  I bless him for this essential statement of the central moral issue of our time, this cry from the deep, this clear exposition of the downside of the current modus operendi of our civilization, and his positivity and persistence in the face of overwhelming opposition.Oh yeah - one other thing - also, all to easily forgotten - Gore actually did win in 2000.	5.0	See it NOW . . . we may not be around for a second run	2006-08-28	16	9	7

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A28WJUJF6D2ULA	Dai-keag-ity	As I watched this DVD, companion to a fine book let me add, I kept thinking that while some critics exist who try (on occasion even eloquently) to pick apart An Inconvenient Truth, is there anyone out there who really thinks polluting our planet as we do is a good thing?The former Vice President does not rant here, does not raise his voice, and under his quiet tone the facts are left to speak for themselves. The unwanted message of this extraordinary film is this: it is up to us to save ourselves. There was a time when people truly did not know about the cause and effect reality of we mere humans having such a drastic impact on something as colossally large as our planet, but we no longer have the excuse of ignorance. If we do not change our destructive practices, not only will we pay for it in ways almost too horrible to contemplate, but so will many generations yet unborn.The best and most daunting aspect of the entire Gore presentation was when the collateral effects of global warming were highlighted. Sure, we all know it could get much hotter, but the consequences of this, the most severe climatic shift in at least 600,000 years, would also be felt in increased storms, droughts, famines, plagues, desertification, the alteration of entire coastlines, and no doubt, to extend thinking a little further, those alive after the melting of the polar glaciers would find themselves locked in internecine wars with the prize being the remnants of whatever resources remained in a world where everything we knew was suddenly greatly different.I hate to sound evangelical about much of anything, but An Inconvenient Truth is the best messenger yet for getting the facts out there, and for that reason, I hope this film is translated into a score of languages and shown on television, before classrooms, groups, churches, wherever possible, so that we can do whatever it takes to stop the ongoing irresponsible misuse of our extremely finite world. This is not a liberal versus conservative matter, it's about human survival.Easily five stars.	5.0	Contains The Most Important Ecological Message Since Silent Spring	2007-01-10	12	9	3

Al Gore has also really perfected his lecture and presentation over the decades that he's been giving this talk.

Regardless of your opinion about Gore's political history, here he combines the consensus of mainstream science with admirable passion to explain in lay terms a crucial issue of our day. This film lacks almost any creativity in that it simply shows Gore giving his Power Point presentation to a live audience. But it is a Power Point well worth considering. Gore includes charts, graphs, statistics, personal anecdotes and before-and-after pictures of the effects of global warming.

Most recent studies have acknowledged the fact that C02 levels are sharply increasing and are directly contributing to rising global temperatures. This DVD provides documented evidence of this.

It's your fault!Oh, I should probably state the point of ""Inconvenient Truth"", which is:#1: The Earth is getting hotter---hot as Hell, really, hot as molten molasses, hot as Pompei at Zero Hour, hot as, well, something really hot---it's warming up every damned minute, even while we sit watching Gore warble on in this air-conditioned theater---the Earth is perspiring, boiling in its own sweaty magma, it's 95 degrees in the shade in Tuscaloosa and at least 10 degrees of that is because of you!Oh, and #2:  You also are killing the polar bears. Or maybe even making the damned things---gulp---hermaphroditic.The point of ""An Inconvenient Truth"", is to shuffle out the latest in environmental hysteria: Global Warming. In the last 20 years, Global Warming has really caught on, managing to edge out the previous Environmental Catastrophe that Time Magazine warned would ""really freeze your shorts"", the Coming Global Ice Age.In the last, oh, 100 years or so (but mostly since Bush took office), the Earth's climate has gotten hotter. How much hotter, you ask?Well, since you asked, about .6 C warmer, plus or minus .2 degrees C (what's a few points of C among friends)? This is catastrophic! And irrefutable!Gore shows you slides and graphs and powerpoints and stuff to prove it is so. Can we doubt him? Gore invented the Internet, so I think not.Did I mention Al Gore is in this movie? Al Gore, with a bunch of slides and graphs and tables and pie-charts. Excited yet? Wanna run out and see this flick yet? Yeah?

Ha! Just kidding on Numero 2. But really, Man is to blame. Or really, *The* Man. Big Business. Or to be true, Big Business that doesn't donate to Mr. Gore's campaign coffers. Or since most of Big Biz likes to hedge its bets---well, you.You don't really *need* to drive a car to work, do you? And what about that air conditioning? Couldn't you just flap your copy of the New Yorker up and down in front of your face, real fast-like?Trouble is, in putting forth its ""Inconvenient Truth"", the film manages to ignore---well, hang me, a bunch of inconvenient truths. Like:1) It's true that global temperatures have risen slightly in the last 100 years. It's also true that human behavior may have contributed slightly to that rise---but even there, the correlation between human behavior and rising global temperatures is not quantitatively strong or certain.2) There are other factors that affect the Earth's climate far more powerfully, and subtly, than smokestacks and car exhaust: the planet's shifting tectonic plates, which enhance or inhibit glaciation over the course of millennia.Indeed, just 10,000 years ago we emerged from the last major global Ice Age, and as recently as the 19th century we were suffering the effects of a Mini Ice Age that during the 14th century devastated Europe and Russia.The good news: we're now in an Interglaciation Cycle, a period of natural global warming. The bad news: that age is about ready to end---well, right about now.3) And finally there are the Milankovitch Cycles, the shifts over time in the Earth's eccentric orbit about the Sun, which in turns dictates the amount of solar radiation the Earth's surface receives, and consequently either warms or cools global temperatures.Think you'll hear anything about Milankovitch Cycles in ""An Inconvenient Truth""? Think Al Gore does his own down-home rendition of The Funky Chicken in the film's final minutes?4) Even the movie poster hints at a really inconvenient truth: as Americans, we can get in a real dander about global warming, but in the end we're pretty much powerless to do anything about it on the policy side. In a sense, it' a cruel little reverse on the old ""Think Globally, Act Locally"" mantra that environmentalists are so keen on.Look at the smokestack on the poster, and then ask yourself this: how many working smokestacks do we have in America these days?Exactly: very damned few.That's because America doesn't *make* anything anymore: environmentalists like Gore drove all that 'old heavy industry', with its toxin-belching smokestacks, away to places like China and India long ago.Both countries are anything but environmentally sensitive, both are at the starting gate of their own automobile and industrial booms, both are rolling out billions of new toxin-belching smokestacks and signing up a billion new drivers! And best of all: both countries would be exempt from the Kyoto Protocol that Gore evangelizes for.5) Which drives home the folly of `saving the Earth', which is going to keep turnin' with or without us. In another 10,000 years, the Earth will be turned into a snowball in the next global wave of glaciation, swallowed up in a new and howlingly terrible Ice Age.And after that, a billion or so years down the line, the Sun will go out and things will all get very cold and quiet.That said, ""An Inconvenient Truth"" does get something right: there IS a lot of hot air in this movie.Trouble is, most of it's coming out of its porky Cassandra, Al Gore, the flabby Boy-who-would-be-King.JSG"	1.0	Chill	2006-06-04	166	36	130

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2I2DE1DJUVQOO	DarthRad	"It was 1970, and in my eighth grade Honors Science class, we were learning about the greenhouse effect, about how CO2 helps to keep the Earth warm, and how on planets like Venus, an excess of CO2 keeps it incredibly hot.I raised my hand up and asked, ""If we keep burning all this fuel and releasing CO2 into the atmosphere, wouldn't the CO2 levels start to go up, and then eventually we'll get a greenhouse effect here on Earth like on Venus?""The Science teacher blinked and thought for a moment, and then said, ""Yeh, you're probably right, but it won't happen for another 100 years, and by then we'll all be DEAD.""Yes, for all you doubters out there, the science of global warming is really that simple - an eighth grader can figure this one out. I have  known it to be true since at least that time.This is a great documentary; Al Gore is terrific in this movie.  After watching this movie, having endured seven years of utter incompetence from the current occupier of the U.S. presidency, I really regretted not having voted for him.But will we be able to turn global warming around and stop disaster from striking?  I doubt it.Here's why - there is just too much human inertia, too much self-interest for people to want to step forward and sacrifice themselves when life is still good.  Al Gore makes the analogy to Churchill and the rise of the Nazis in Europe, and it is a terrific analogy, because, nobody, least of all Americans, wanted to take on Hitler at that time.  It was not until people had absolutely no choice that they were forced to act.And so I think that it will not be until life is unbearable that things will change.  Picture a third of the state of Florida under water.  Picture Shanghai and the Netherlands underwater. Picture a world of alternating excesses of water and massive drought all over.It is already happening, but the disasters have so far mostly affected the weak, the infirm, the old, and the poor.  The people who died in Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, the 30,000+  people who died in the summer heat wave in Europe in 2003, the killings in Darfur (a political conflict brought on largely by drought in the Sudan), the Pacific Islanders forced to move off their islands - the suffering of these people have barely registered in the minds of most people.It will not be until the vocal, affluent, middle and upper classes of America and Europe begin to suffer the effects of global warming that things really begin to change.And even then, how do you convince the 3 billion people of China and India to change?  They will continue to yearn for the living standards of the industrialized West.So, this is the Inconvenient Truth that Gore skips over in his talk: our modern standard of living simply requires vast amounts of energy, energy that we currently are able to generate only with carbon based fuels that release CO2.As just one example, the historic population shift in the United States into the Southern states was made possible entirely because of the development of central air conditioning.  Most of the Southern United States would be almost uninhabitable during the summer without air conditioning - modern office buildings often don't even have windows that can be opened to allow fresh air in.  Gore's own house in Tennessee was recently revealed to be a huge energy sink.  Similarly, much of the Northern states would be uninhabitable in the winter without heating fuel.  All of the things in modern society that we take for granted - air conditioning, cars, air travel, electric lights, running hot water, television, computers, aluminum, plastics, etc., etc., require huge amounts of energy which currently can only be produced by carbon based fuels.The truth is that in order to stop global warming, we have to stop producing CO2 entirely.  CO2 levels are already at historic highs.  Merely reducing the rate at which we produce more CO2 will only slow the exponential rate at which the CO2 levels continue to rise, not reverse the trend and drop those CO2 levels.  And so all of the usual environmentalist measures for reducing CO2 emissions - solar energy, wind energy, biomass fuels, carbon taxes, greenhouse gas credits, fluorescent light bulbs, improved auto gas mileage, etc., etc., simply will not produce or save enough energy to reverse the rising CO2 levels.Outside of this DVD, Gore has dismissed the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to help solve global warming.  While I agree with him that nuclear fission is a dead end, for all the usual reasons, nuclear fusion has been seriously overlooked by nearly everyone in this debate.  Tokamaks and inertial confinement systems are no longer merely theoretical devices, and we are only one massive scientific development program away from producing commercially viable nuclear fusion power plants.Only nuclear fusion has the promise to satisfy both needs: to produce the massive amounts of energy needed to power our modern society and completely eliminate all CO2 emissions.  I believe that our future prosperity as a species will depend on our ability to harness the power of nuclear fusion.In the end, if we do not stop global warming, global warming will stop us.  The catastrophic disasters predicted for continued global warming can only result in a massive reduction in the number of people on this planet.  And that will cause the CO2 levels to drop, finally."	5.0	...In its place, we are entering a period of consequences...	2007-06-05	1	0	1

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2GPLOLLE6BUDT	Dave	I am from Tennessee and have been familiar with Al Gore and his ability to insert exagerated images of himself into any topic.  The most famous example of which was his claim of inventing the internet.  I bought his movie because I was hoping to get a little more education on global warming.  While some of the prentation was worthwhile, Al spent entirely too much time talking about himself as opposed to the topic of the movie.  The global warming information could have been presented in 1/3 of the time taken up by the movie.  There must have been 10 minutes spent on shots of Al staring pensively at his notebook computer screen which was a overused prop throughout the movie.  We had to hear again about how guilty he and his family felt about raising tobacco after his sister died of lung cancer.  While I sympathize with Al and his family over their loss, I am a little tired of hearing about it, especially when it has nothing to do with global warming.  I also beleive much of the global warming evidence presented in the film was one sided and a little statisically misleading, particularly when graphical information was sometimes presented with a numerically labeled x/y axis scale and other graphical information was presented conveniently excluding a measureable x/y scale.  I beleive global warming is a real issue we need to confront and honestly and objectively.  I think Al's self promoting movie on this subject failed my standard.  Al's movie treats global warming as a political argument which he must win where less than honest and objective means are justified by his cause.  While Al certainly has not dipped as low as a Michael Moore, he has further spent credibility which he has little left to spare.	2.0	A little too self promoting	2007-01-03	32	8	24

It was not that I didn't want to know. I just didn't want to be depressed. I had heard great things about the film, how clear and eloquent the arguments were, but the image my mind conjured of sitting through two to three hours of depressing ""I told you so's"" was just enough for me to hesitate. I finally decided that I wanted to see it and that nothing should stop me. I was floored by how entertaining this film actually was. Al Gore has developed a stage personality over the past few years, and it is brazenly on display in this film.I was also surprised at the pains he takes throughout the film to avoid assigning blame [on the current administration presumably] and how he endeavors to clarify each issue and the complex math it takes to reach the conclusions set forth in this film. It is fantastically directed, and moves forward at a brisk pace unheard of in most documentaries. I had expected either a dry, snorefest of facts and doomsday predictions or something along the line of Michael Moore's documentary a few years back. I have rarely been so delighted to be so wrong.This movie is more than a must-see because of the message it carries. It is a wonderful example of how educational film can be entertaining as well. The steps Mr. Gore lays out at the end of the film are easy enough to consider, and therein lies the greatest hope - that we can actually (and easily) do something about this problem."	5.0	Inspiring, but more... entertaining	2007-03-22	12	7	5

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3EEBE82C3HYRD	David	"UPDATE:I've taken 4 more people to the film, 2 of which are steadfast Republican. ALL found the film to be very important. That doesn't mean they all like Al Gore because they don't, but they thought the message was very important. Crediting this movie, another household will be purchasing green power, which is available in our area.REMARKS:1. I've read all 15 reviews of 3 or fewer stars, and it was clear that 12 of them didn't see the movie altogether. The other 3? Two seemed to have been expecting an action movie, not a documentary (the reviews were ""Gore Speaks The 'Truth'!"" and ""boring university lecture""). One seemed to have phased out after the first 10 minutes (""Chill""), and ranted on about other things for 75% of the review. Basically, if you actually watch this movie realizing there are no car chases or explosions, 9 out of 10 people will agree this is a 4+ star movie. If you also go in with an open mind, 99 out of 100.2. President Bush: ""I believe that greenhouse gases are creating a problem, a long-term problem that we got to deal with. ... There's an interesting confluence now between dependency upon fossil fuels from a national economic security perspective, as well as the consequences of burning fossil fuels for greenhouse gases."" He said this in an interview on June 30, 2005. (Find the interview that contains this quotation by searching google with ""bush global warming quotation"" and look for the timesonline site). The fact that President Bush acknowledges global warming as a problem caused by humans is important and should have been included in this film. I think this would have reached out to many of those who do not trust the media or Al Gore.REVIEW:This film is entertaining, but is best described as engaging.Seeing this film will make the evidence clear. As polarizing a figure as Gore seems to be, he lays out this evidence in a very clear way, a way that anyone can understand and appreciate. Perhaps the most convincing evidence is the graph that shows the carbon dioxide levels and temperature levels over the last 600,000 years -- they line up pretty much perfectly. Note that the CO2 levels at anytime during those 600,000 years are nowhere near the levels they are at today.What is to come in the future due to global warming is also discussed. The melting in the Arctic and Antarctic. We expect the ice in the Arctic to completely disappear during (northern hemisphere) summers in less than 50 years. A possible disruption of the main ocean currents, which are in part fed by the cold of the Arctic. Melting ice in Greenland and the Antarctic will cause a rise in ocean levels (consider that much of many major portions of major cities in the U.S. and around the world have elevation &lt;10 feet, and many cities completely under 20 feet, many in hurricane prone regions like Florida).This film will do what it is set out to do -- convince the people who actually see it that the problem is serious. So, do you believe in global warming already? Do you believe it is a serious problem that we need to deal with now? If not, see the movie. No, see the DOCUMENTARY. If you answered yes to both questions, still see it, but bring someone who doesn't already realize how serious the problem is, otherwise the purpose of this movie is kind of moot.Be sure to stick around for a bit after the movie ""ends"" for some very well designed (written) comments.WEBSITE:The movie's website is w w w .climatecrisis. n e t, and it has numerous ways to reduce carbon emission, a topic that was not addressed thoroughly in the movie.-Updated on July 1st, adding the first and last of the four sections."	5.0	If you are a skeptic, see it.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A27D8ADDYNY5N8	David H. Peterzell PhD PhD	"I have some observations, some positive and some negative:1) The film is an appeal to viewers' intellect.  A film like this is rare.  We live in anti-intellectual times, where sound-bites rule the day, violence is glorified in the media, concentrated greed trumps civility and common sense, and steroid-fueled atheletes are considered ""heroes.""  The popular movie that appeals to the altruistic thinking person, with an analytic, fact-finding mind, is a rarity, so this is indeed welcome.  More of this sort of thing, please!2) The movie is clearly a self-aggrandizing, self-indulgent attempt by Gore to improve his image and consolidate his power.  It may not be partisan (in the Republican vs. Democrat sense) but the people who say this isn't partisan need to unclog their carotid arteries a little.  Well, that sounds more negative than I intended because I like Gore and I love the fact he's dedicated to increasing public awareness of an important topic.  There's no doubt that Gore has emphasized environmental issues for many years. But notice that the focus is on Gore.  The key scientists are rarely actually named, especially if they are living, though they are the real heroes.  Sure, Gore names a few but not the ones I would have expected.  Long standing activists and writers are also omitted, such as Paul and Anne Erlich, Barry Commoner, Amory Lovins, etc., etc.  Many of you left the movie enamored of Gore.  But please take a deeper look at the science, the issue and the politician.  The science and the issue are hugely important.  I'm more interested in seeing politicians use their power to address environmental issues than in seeing environmental issues co-opted to increase the power of specific lobbies and individuals.3) It is a nice layman's intro to global warming.  It is much deeper than the sound-bite garbage that you see on TV.  If you are the rare person who is really interested in the science underlying the issue, then learn more about the topic, minus the agendas of Al Gore and Hollywood.  Become familiar, for instance, with the work of Ralph Cicerone, one of the founders of atmospheric chemistry and current president of the National Academy of Science.  He's a great scientist, and a good guy (and add points for the fact he's married to a great sensory scientist... ok, that's my issue).  Take 5 minutes online to find and read Cicerone's (July 21, 2005) CURRENT STATE OF CLIMATE SCIENCE: RECENT STUDIES FROM THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES. Then, take half an hour or so to listen to an interview with Cicerone from NASonline (using RealPlayer).  You'll hear one of America's greatest scientists outlining the facts, the scientific debates, and the remaining questions.  You can find a few right-wing crackpots who take pot shots at Cicerone, but he's the real deal.4) It is pro-science.  This is a key point in this time of anti-scientific thinking. The film has the potential to increase viewers' interest in science and scientific thinking.  Whether or not you accept the science as it is presented in the film, this is an important point.  Don't stop here, as this film is the finger pointing at science, not science per se.  If you don't believe the theories and facts presented here, then you can bring your own science and facts to the table.  Putting an emphasis on theory, facts, and data is pro science.  If you can't handle this, go back to watching football, getting fat on your couch, and voting for Bush, or whatever.  You won't be alone, so smile.5) It is a beautiful film with striking graphics.  If, like me, you love a good graph or informative picture, take a look at Kosslyn's new book on making graphs.  Kosslyn is the world's greatest expert on imagery, and is a cognitive and neural scientist extraordinaire.  Telling a story in graphs and pictures is hugely important.  Kudos to the filmmakers for the quality of their graphics.6) The movie is an advertisement for Apple computer and Apple products. Perhaps this is not obvious. But Apple technology is everywhere in the film, and also the accompanying book. The computers are displayed prominently, and the Keynote program is at the heart of Gore's presentation. Gore is on Apple's board of directors. You can learn more about Apple's link to the film/book/Gore at Apple's website. I'm a big fan of Apple and its innovative technologies, so I'm not complaining. But don't miss the fact that you are being lulled into buying Apple products.7) It is strong motivation do something important in life; to make changes that contribute to the greater good.  And the film is strong motivation to commit yourself to the future, but to live your life as if there will be no tomorrow.  Want to read a great book on conscious, effective activism?  Read Andrew Beath's ""Consciousness in Action: The Power of Beauty, Love and Courage in a Violent Time""8) The Bush adminsitration is a noteworthy part of the global warming story, but this is not emphasized by Gore.  Sure, there are some allusions to Bush's shortsightedness.  But the disturbing fact is that the Bush administration has been attempting to silence the global warming story. Gore didn't mention this, for political reasons, I'm sure. The administration has been doing more to silence scientists than any previous administration, apparently. Don't believe me? NASAs top climate scientist, Jim Hansen, is but one person who discusses this fact. For instance, watch Revkin's interview with Hansen available online at the New York Times website. When pressured by the NYT, Bush admitted to forcing scientists to shift their public positions on global warming. Bush publicly denies the importance of the issue. His link to fossil fuel dollars is one reason for this, to be sure. Bush is the enemy. That's a fact.  The book that seems to clarify the political issues is the one I'm reading at the moment: ""The Republican War on Science"", by Chris Mooney.9) There's a book and website that accompany the movie.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2L7A6TZXHRNU1	"David Keller ""JasonT_99"""	"C'mon Al let's get real and stop twisting the facts and only using extremists as your sources.  Fact 1: In the last 30 years the average annual temperature has gone up .6 degrees.  (6 tenths of one degree) That's not even one full degree in 30 years! The reason it looks so dramatic is the graphic is magnified to the point that makes it look like we are facing large temperature rises.  Anyone who doesn't these this as a political movie is just plain blind or incredibly naive.  Fact 2: The true scientific consensus is that even if the temperature rises as Al claims, the rise of sea level will be only 2 feet as compared with Al's claim of 20 feet.  The 20 feet claim is laughable mainstream scientists.  Fact 3: Scientists can prove that the earth has had many cooling and warming cycles for thousands of years, long before man could possibly contribute to it.  Funny how these cycles have never destroyed the earth before.  Fact 4: Mainstream scientists have been studying one such naturally occurring warming cycle that was a recent as the Middle Ages around 1200 to 1400 AD. (Again, this was during a time in which man had no industrial mean to pollute.) Fact 5: Scientists have proven that there are and always been natural variations in the ozone layer caused by atmospheric changes and natural disasters.  Fact 6: One volcanic eruption causes far more pollution and Co2 gases than the entire earth population in a year and there are far more volcanic eruptions every year than people realize.  Fact 7: Extremists (and AL) are attempting to get congress to label Co2 gases as a pollutant.  Folks, WE EXHALE Co2!  The extremists want to label our very lives as pollutants to ""mother"" earth as though we are an infestation to the very environment in which we were meant to live. How can anyone believe anything they say?  Once they label us pollutants they can further regulate and control our lives. (Think Euthanasia and Abortion)  Fact 8:  Less than 20% of scientists believe global warming is happening due to man's pollution if at all. The most honest ones claim not to know for certain.  Environmentalists enlist scientists sympathetic to their cause which are looking to support their claims. A true scientist seeks the truth, not a way to prove something he/she believes in by only looking at what supports their cause and ignoring everything else.  Which leads me to Fact 9: Even if we are in a warming cycle there is absolutely NO PROOF that man is causing it.  The forces of nature and the magnitude of the Earth are so vast that it is far too incomprehensible for our limited minds to grasp with a true understanding.  To think that we are capable of destroying it so easily is sheer arrogance on our part.  Fact 10:  According to the Carter administrations so-called research we were supposed to run out of oil before the year 2000. This is yet another false scare tactic.  Fact 11: Some of us are old enough to remember the scare tactic of the early 1970's when it was that we would be facing another Ice Age very soon. More Scare Tactics try Bird Flu.  Fact 12: Bird Flu has killed 38 people world wide and has not shown a tendency to be transferred to humans.  38 People!  That's your epidemic.To conclude, this doesn't mean people shouldn't do their part in trying to keep the environment clean but we don't have to go to extremes to do so.  Nobody wants polluted drinking water and nobody wants to destroy the environment. Al Gore hugely over states his so-called results to sensationalize his material.  His film is a huge tribute to him being one of the early ones to discover this just like he invented the Internet.  Fact 13: We have more trees today than we did 30 years ago as part of our programs to keep renewing our resources.  How many more stories and scare tactics must we endure before we realize the falsehoods and agendas contained in their arguments. Everyone needs to look at the Chicken Little story and stop the panic. The sky is not falling."	1.0	A scare tactic which only uses extreme sources that agree with him	2007-01-18	52	15	37

Gore does an amazing job in his presentation conveying his message about what is happening and what we must do to stop this.  He presents this more like a ""friend to friend"" format than in a politician's crafted jargon.  It is definitely a must watch.The reason I am giving this 4 stars, however, is that as Gore mentions how we must reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the movie shows him at one point riding in a motorcade on his way to deliver his presentation and at another point him driving a Cadillac on his Tenessee farm.  Obviously these aren't two ways to do what he emphasizes, even though the motorcade was for security reasons.  While I have read elsewhere that Gore does primarily drive a hybrid vehicle, I was somewhat bothered that the movie shows him doing otherwise.

All the while... the media does their best to spread the liberal religion of environmental conservation!!! Yet, when the TRUTH is finally revealed in hard facts, it is either downplayed, or ignored completely by the media who relentlessly attacked the messengers of the story. In case you missed the 20-second media report, I'm talking about emails that were hacked from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit. This facility plays a leading role in compiling reports for the United Nations regarding long-term climate changes in the Earth's environment. The messages from the unit's director, Phil Jones, discussed ways the research unit MANIPULATED DATA that failed to comply with the ""establishment view that climate change is real and is being driven by man"". In the messages Jones discusses ""hiding the decline"" in long-term temperature changes from those climatologists who aren't drinking the Al Gore Kool-Aid. Another message revealed Jones' attempt to control the publication of research carried out by global warming scientists who were known ""skeptics"". One way of accomplishing this would be to take the panel of researchers who review papers prior to publication, and ""load"" them with Kool-Aid drinkers who are ""on-message"". I guess it's safer to surround yourself with Kool-Aid drinkers who cannot think or question anything for themselves. When asked, Al Gore refused to debate his claims with the climatologists who are debunking his junk science. Yet in spite of this, you didn't see any attacks on ""ALGORE"" or even a single debate between experts of differing opinions. Had emails similar in nature been taken from a conservative think tank demonstrating this level of deception, I ponder to think where it may have gone in the media. One last tidbit... my favorite ""Algore Fact"" was when he was speaking before his flock and made the statement that the Earth's core is ""millions of degrees"" (in case you're unaware, the surface of the sun is less than 10,000 degrees)! So if you want to watch a movie designed to do one thing - raise money - then have at it.

I've read at least my share of books on global warming.  So I didn't expect anything new.  Yet there was something new.  The fact that the soil loses moisture to the atmosphere as the temperature rises, the fact that sea ice breaking off can accelerate the breaking off of land ice, the fact that typhoons in the Southern Hemisphere have hit record levels--these facts and a few more I didn't know until I viewed this video.  But even more significant was the lucid clarity of the presentation.  Instead of writing a book for the few, Gore made a video for the many.You don't want to miss this.  Here is a guy who could be president of the United States.  Here is a guy that arguably got cheated out of the presidency.  Here is a guy who is light years ahead of the present occupant of the White House in almost everything that we consider noble in humanity.  And what does he do after losing a microscopically close race that maybe he really didn't lose?  He recognizes the greatest problem facing humanity; educates himself to an outstanding degree on the subject, and then puts together a program for informing as many citizens as possible about the grave danger facing this planet.  This production is the result of all his work.All I can say is, Gore for President in 2008!Would that it were possible.  The special interests and the head-in-the-sand couch potatoes will find some way to ridicule him; and the corporations against the truth about global warning will pour massive bucks into making sure that he is not one of the candidates in 2008.One of the other things that I thought about while watching this outstanding video, this PowerPoint presentation deluxe, this slide show for the century, this beautifully presented visual argument for action now before it is too late--is how amazing it is that the people who control the media, who make sure that, as Gore points out, the truth of global warming is thought to be scientifically ""controversial,"" when in fact there is no scientific controversy at all, only a commercial media controversy--how amazing it is, I thought, that despite all the mass media control, the message is getting out.  This video is being seen by millions of people.Be sure you see it.  The worst case scenario for global warming is worse than almost any other imaginable disaster.  Terrorism, even nuclear warfare, pales in comparison to the earth in a runaway greenhouse catastrophe.  Imagine Venus with the surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.  Global warming could lead to a sterilization of the planet.And THAT is why Gore has devoted himself to warning us.Bottom line: this is a smart, sharp and very moving visual presentation, brilliantly directed by Davis Guggenheim, a presentation that I hope reaches an enormous audience, who will in turn assert themselves toward saving the planet before it is too late.  Remember, a runaway greenhouse effect could reach a stage, without our knowing it, past the point of no return."	5.0	A deeply moving wake up call for human beings	2006-11-30	29	21	8

This might have been a very good lecture to go to, but as a movie the film comes up short. It's just not very good and seems to really drag towards the middle. This film could have really benefitted from being produced like an actual documentary. I would have liked to hear from some of these scientists and scientific experts that Gore talks about and maybe some live footage instead of photo stills. And the Al Gore bio side-story side-tracks the entire movie. People didn't want to hear him blah, blah, blahing about himself and his family when he ran for president and the same people won't want to hear it now.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3Q7F9C0MV94AT	"D. G. Frank ""Dr Frank"""	"I have been carefully following the scientific literature on 'Global Warming' since the early 80's, when a prominent speaker at a Chemistry Department colloquium proposed that we needed to burn all the fossil fuels we can to stave off the impending ice age. So I am familiar with the science in this area, and was stunned when I watched this movie to see so many apparently deliberate misrepresentations of the data.In retrospect, I have concluded that I should not blame Gore for making so many scientific and statistical errors in his movie. After all, he is passionate about this issue, he is not a scientist, and the movie accurately portrays his passion for this topic. Thus, seen as a documentary about him, it is pretty good. Evaluated from a scientific perspective, however, it reeks.At the AAAS meeting in Chicago last year, Gore confirmed my suspicions. He said, speaking to an overflow crowd of scientists from around the world, ""I don't understand most of what the scientists give me, I just repeat it."" You could hear audible gasps throughout the audience.So much of the science in this movie has already been reviewed and/or invalidated by the scientific community that I need not mention it here. However, it is worthy of mention that even when the movie first came out, the 2007 review of it in Science included the comment:""Gore leaves the viewer with the mistaken impression that CO2 is the driver of climate change in that historic record.""Enough said.My purpose for writing is to report the success I've had using the movie in my science classes as negative examples of statistical fallacies. Nearly EVERY slide has a GLARING statistical error in it. It is remarkable really, if not pitiful. One almost wonders if it were deliberate. What I think is going on is that Gore is trying to make the message as compelling as he can to the audience that doesn't look too closely.There are several examples of mixing data sets, cherry-picking data, exaggerated or incomplete scales, correlation vs. causation, anecdotal data, using real dollars instead of inflation adjusted dollars...the list goes on and on. A literal grab-bag of illustrations.Now that I've had a few years to calm down, and Gore has essentially admitted his ignorance, I'm glad this movie was produced, as it documents the disaster that can happen when politics tries to employ science to its own ends."	4.0	Wonderful material for illustrating statistical fallacies.	2009-11-03	9	6	3

This has occurred many times in the past. Alarmist include Al Gore doesn't take in account the history of climate change over decades instead of just a few years from the 1970's. This year was suppose to the be worst hurricane season ever, what happened. The Gulf and Atlantic oceans were warmer than usual but the Pacific Ocean was colder. That equals balance. Sure man has changed the climate a bit but not as bad as Al Gore wants you to believe. The polar ice caps have melted but warmer temperatures cause more rain over these regions which replace the ice cap. This is anothe cycle of earth.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3DIKJP95XTKX0	"D. I. Shipley ""David Shipley"""	"Congratulations to Al Gore for taking on a subject largely regarded as anathema by the US political establishment. In both the book and dvd, the information is presented starkly but in a nonetheless straight forward format. For those already with an interest in global warming, most of the issues raised will probably be what you have already come across but nonetheless be prepared for some new information or insights. For anyone who has yet to examine the scientific concerns on global warming, then this is a very good place indeed to start. Some have criticised the inclusion of Al Gore's real life experiences. I, however, think that they actually complement the information that is being put across. Yes the science is still unsure on many of the issues, however, it IS becoming increasingly apparent that C02 emissions from industry, petrol engines etc are contributing to driving global temperatures upwards. That said, there is truth though that global warming is a natural event because thanks to analysis carried out on ice samples from the Greenland permafrost, thousands of years old, we have a clear record of many natural warming cycles going back millennia.The question we have to ask ourselves is do we really need to be adding to this natural process to the point of endangering our environment and even our existence?Increasingly powerful hurricanes and storms like Katrina will become more common. As ice flows shrink, there will be corresponding rises in sea levels, and more heavily populated areas will experience the horror that hit New Orleans.However, I would like to add some new scenarios into the already troubling possibilities:Firstly, Science has established that thanks to the reduction in the use of CFCs we are seeing an improvement in the Ozone hole over the Antarctic. However, scientists are now concerned that heavy C02 releases in the northern hemisphere could cool the upper atmosphere to the point that new holes in Ozone layer open up over the Arctic, bringing the danger of UV rays with them as they do so...Secondly, before the age of the dinosaurs, there was a period known as the Permian. The end of this period saw the biggest ever mass extinction that this planet has ever seen, where upwards of 90% of all life perished. It was thought that the killer was a meteorite bigger than the one that took out the dinosaurs. Recent science has found that there were in fact two killers, and neither was a meteorite.The first was massive volcanic action in the region of Siberia which was so huge that it raised global temperatures by 5C. This killed off many species of life. However, once the seas had heated up by 5C, then this was  the key that released the second killer from its confinement - Methane Gas. Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gasses in existence and releasing large quantities of it into the atmosphere will cause warming on a greater scale than that caused by emissions of C02.Surrounding the coastlines of all continents are huge pockets of methane that are stored in the ocean floor, and have come from millennia of decaying organic matter rolling off the continents and into the sea. These deposits are called Methane Hydrates. What happened is that after the temperatures rose at the end of the Permian, the sea temperature rose by 5C, causing the Methane Hydrates to release vast quantities of Methane into the atmosphere. This promptly raised global temperatures by a further 5C, killing off virtually all marine life and even more of the life on the land.So there you have it folks. A temperature rise of 10C caused the greatest mass extinction that this world has ever seen. And here we are, contributing our own gasses to a warming cycle..... despite the fact that there are huge quantities of Methane Hydrates just offshore (just ask the oil industry as to the hazards they create for offshore drilling). Scientific tests have shown that if water temperature in the oceans rises by 5C then the Methane Hydrates will release all their gas......As the song says ""Something better change..."""	5.0	Powerful message	2006-10-18	0	0	0
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3EJYJC25OJVKK	"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer"""	"I have long been interested in global climate studies and have many atlases from over the years. Many of them have emphasized about the possibilities of global warming that is taking place since the end of World War II. The topic has gone off and on for decades now but has been in the background until just recently with the most active and destructive hurricane season in 2005 with the entire Roman alphabet name being exhausted and resorting to the Greek Alphabet. There were 27 named tropical storms in 2005, the first time that any season saw it's entire English list exhausted. Not only that, but a record five names were retired from the hurricane naming list: Dennis, Emily, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma! Many environmentalists have contributed the record number of deadly hurricanes to the warming of the planet's oceans.This documentary by director David Guggenheim and by former vice president and presidential candidate Al Gore entitled ""An Inconvenient Truth"" is a much more detailed and far more gripping documentary about his knowledge of global climate systems and how all of the world's weather systems are interconnected. Al Gore has been active in the environmental movement for more than thirty years and studied global warming from high school onwards. Gore himself has said that all of the data that he has gotten from all sources on the changing climate due to global warming is completely irrefutable. A panel of 928 global climate experts were interviewed on whether global warming is happening or not and the percentage of those 928 who disagreed with global warming actually happening was a dead zero! Out of 928, not one disagreed that global warming is happening and we're feeling the effects of it.The most terrifying part of this documentary was the part about the icecaps of Antarctica and the North Pole breaking apart and I actually remember the news about a large chuck of an ice shelf larger than Rhode Island actually breaking off the Antarctic Ice Shelf and out into the Atlantic Ocean. The ultimate frightening part was the graphic simulations of what would happen if the Earths ocean levels would rise as a result of unmitigated global warming. The map of Florida as well as other coastal areas worldwide would have to be completely redrawn. Say goodbye to much of Florida, New York City, London, Shanghai, and much of Bangladesh. Already, the peoples of entire nations have been blaming America for it's arrogant hostility towards the Kyoto treaty yet even there, hundreds of cities have been taking action to reduce their pollutants in their areas.For obvious reasons, the cause of a lot of this is not by natural cycles in warming and cooling of the planet because while carbon in the atmosphere has fluctuated in ups and downs, the latest increase in carbon emissions is unprecedented. Two prime causes of all of this are the high number of coal-fired power plants as well as the high number of cars and trucks that still are built from outdated technology. ""An Inconvenient Truth"" it surely is. The high number of automobiles in relation to the population is the main reason, along with lack of political will to change, why the United States remains by far the worst contributor to carbon dioxide emissions. Yet we have the wisdom, the technology and the ability to actually take steps to retool our economy, refurbish our infrastructure, make our homes more energy efficient, as well as wean ourselves off excessive petroleum and coal consumption and reverse the skyrocketing level of CO2 emissions.Al Gore himself has done many lectures at many of the world's major cities from Beijing, Berlin, Chicago, Paris, London, Moscow, Los Angeles, San Diego, Shanghai, and countless others. His knowledge convinced him to give warning about the devastating consequences of unrestrained CO2 emissions as well as the hope and knowledge to actually reverse this increase in greenhouse gases. I already have started this by not having a car. Sure it's inconvenient but walking while taking much longer has inspired me to live more in tune with my surroundings more.A major argument that I was very much in agreement with was that our automobile industry's decline is mostly due to the fact that both Ford and General Motors continue to produce cars and trucks that have very obsolete engines that use up an unnecessary amount of fuel to drive while Japanese automakers Honda, Toyota have taken action and have been building cars that have far, FAR better gas mileage and because of this, Honda, and Toyota continue to enjoy relatively healthy sales and their fortunes continue to improve while American automakers Ford and General Motors due to not improving fuel efficiency have suffered enormously.In the end, it has some great steps, a good number of which I've long been aware of but yet found very inspiring nonetheless. None of them are necessarily things that can be done overnight but they are still very simple and actually fun to do. Even if one's political views are a whole world away, I strongly recommend that EVERYONE go and see ""An Inconvenient Truth"" right away! There's so much that needs to be done and for those who feel that there is no way to reduce their contributions to this problem, ""An Inconvenient Truth"" will give them the knowledge and steps to take to change for the better. It is not necessarily a documentary to bring despair but instead warn about doing nothing but also being able to open the eyes of those who have yet to see the consequences of their actions in relation to the environment.Go and see ""An Inconvenient Truth"" right away!

Also, I believe that the discouragement of the use of D.D.T., worldwide, may have had disasterous consequences given the spread of malaria in those areas that did not undergo massive D.D.T. spraying; malaria has been virtually eliminated in the United States and Europe, where D.D.T. was used in large amounts, but continues to kill on the order of millions in Africa where it was hardly used at all. Also, I question the abridgment of human liberties in the name of certain causes, such as the protection of one species or another or the maintenance of some ""pristine"" environment.That said, Al Gore, in An Inconvenient Truth, makes a clear and compelling case that 1) Global Warming is real, 2) We are responsible for it, 3) It will have disasterous consequences on our environment, and thus ourselves, if left unchecked.For the most part, An Inconvenient Truth is the filming of a lecture that Gore delivers as a college seminar. We watch Gore as he provides study after study, statistic after statistic, to support his conclusions. He comes across as very well informed, reasonable, and sincere in his convictions.The skeptic in me says that, there is probably ""another side of the story."" I hope--and I believe that Mr. Gore would hope as well--that this film inspires people to try to learn as much as they can about this topic in order to reach an informed opinion. I personally plan on investigating further, and also to seek out that ""other side"" to see if it has anything meaningful to contribute to the discussion, but this film seems to have strong evidence which will not be challenged easily, if at all.The conservative in me says that, whatever the truth of Global Warming, it is still a difficult question as to whether or not individual liberties should be curtailed in order to address it. And yet, if we lose the very Earth, then what do we have left to fight for? It's a difficult question that every conservative of conscience will have to deal with, should the science presented here bear out.It is possible, where this subject is concerned, that we must rethink the label ""environmentalism"" and relegating concerns of Global Warming to one political party or another. We share one planet and are all affected by the changes we make to it.In short, this is a strong movie. It is important viewing and, whatever your political or philosophical stance going in, it presents some compelling arguments that must be addressed. Despite the fact that I am both a conservative and a skeptic, I am not unmoved by this film's message; the evidence is out, the conclusions seem clear, and we must respond."	5.0	A Strong, Clear and Compelling Case	2006-06-04	42	31	11

Neiman	"With so many impeccably credible refutations available from so many sources, it's amazing that 'new world order' politicians continue to get traction from this fraud. The public's acceptance of this scam betrays their addiction to feel-good sensationalism and intellectual laziness; ignoring lawsuits from scientists to force the IPCC to stop misrepresenting them, and, proclamations from the U.S. National Science Foundation invalidating Gore's high temperature claims. Neither has the British High Court's ban of the film - pending the correction of blatant lies such as the likelihood of coastal flooding - nor the Czechoslovakian president's warning that this movement represented ""a greater danger than communism"" registered with the public, at least as of yet.What is most sad however, is that attacking CO2 (which results from rather than causes global warming), could deny its considerable agricultural benefits to many peoples and regions desperately in need of better nutrition and living conditions. Unfortunately, most people won't understand, until after the fact, that the Kyoto gang's objective is to shift the focus of taxation onto increasingly higher valued energy expenditures; away from decreasingly valuable payroll revenues as rising Asian productivity further depreciates Western wage bases. Gore actually explained this in his 2007 Congressional testimony, for anyone willing to open their eyes and ears. That's why The Washington Post's reaction to ""The Great Global Warming Swindle"" DVD was, ""Devastating""."	1.0	How to raise taxes through fear mongering	2007-12-31	26	10	16

The few remaining doubters are usually paid by the Oil/Energy lobby or known to clamour for publicity by causing controversy rather than bothering with the facts. The only way to stop this issue from being distorted and misrepresented until it is too late (which it may already be, we are definitely at the brink of no return) is to beat the polluters by their own game - scream as loud and as much as you can and keep repeating the (inconvenient) truth over and over and over. At least it's the truth, as opposed to most other codswallop that is shoved down our throats by the pundits.This movie (and book) is a great way to bring the message to the masses. I never much liked Al Gore but on this topic he is a true hero. Heed the call, spread the word, make everyone you know watch it, lobby your schools to show it to the kids, don't get drawn into meaningless arguments with non-informed dimwits and bought naysayers. Just give them the DVD/book and then argue about how you can fix it.This really isn't a topic where we can wait and see and keep collecting data until every angle is proven 100% fact (which is impossible in natural science).

Gore has taken on the task of presenting the information to thousands of audiences around the world and this movie documents that. The film is not about political positions, which have only served to polarize this issue. This is a scientific phenomenon that some wish to ignore because of the myth that you can't be pro-environment and capitalist at the same time. I have a degree in Earth Science and the evidence for human-induced climate change seemed overwhelming as an undergraduate student 15 years ago, now we have clear effects rapidly materializing.The film makes clear the moral responsibility to address our impacts on global warming, and that decision makers who continue to ignore or otherwise dismiss the issue are jeopordizing the balance in earth systems that permits life to thrive on this unique planet. There is hope, but we must act now. If you are not sure where to begin, start with this film. If you are one of the dwindling number of skeptics, please put your assumptions aside and watch this movie. We owe it to our offspring to do what is in our power to reduce our impacts on the atmosphere and preserve the ability of Earth to provide for intelligent life.	5.0	Recommended by 10 out of 10 scientists!	2008-07-15	13	5	8
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AIA1X0R7JEIA8	Duane Browning	I saw this movie in the theatres and downloaded it on Amazon's Unbox. It was just as shocking both times that I saw it. People have taken issue with how the movie presented its facts and figures. The truth is that Science is not something so simple that you can read a magazine and know all there is about a topic. Al Gore has done his best, via this medium, to present the case that Global Warming is a fact and not a theory. Errors were made, but the overwhelming consensus by scientists who have seen the film is that it gives the best presentation to the public that can be given. Al Gore presented the information in a way that most of us can easily understand and the errors were minor and did not detract from the overall truth of his messege.I keep hearing about the so-called Oregon Petiton, where thousands of scientists rejected the Kyoto Agreement. This petition was circulated by the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, which specilizes in biochemistry, diagnostic medicine, nutrition, preventive medicine and the molecular biology of aging. These sciences have nothing, whatsoever, to do with sciences that research global warming. Sciences that do include: physics, geophysics, climatology, meteorology, oceanography, and environmental science. No verification was made of any of the signatories credentials, so you could claim to be anything and the OISM would let it stand. In fact, many of the signatories were linked to companies like Exxon and their public mouthpieces that try to head-off the environmentalist movement.People are alarmed that taking action against global warming will have disasterous effect upon our economy and stall the advances of technology. Given that the technology already exists that can reverse much of the causes of global warming, there is little evidence that the naysayer's claims are true. People made similar claims in the 1800s about how devastating it would be if we abolished slavery in the US. The economic suffering it would cause, etc. Well, here we are, over 140 years later and I doubt if you could find anyone today who would say that abolishing slavery was a bad thing.Al Gore wasn't making the case that we should abandon our cars and live in mud huts. He wants us all to take the steps we have available that can save our way of life, so that future generations have a world they can live in.	5.0	Truth Is Too Inconvenient For Some	2007-01-02	33	24	9

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A13E0ARAXI6KJW	Ed Uyeshima	"Like many others, I have been impressed by Al Gore's passion for environmentalism since reading his thoughtful and meticulously researched 1993 book, ""Earth in the Balance"", just as he became our Vice President. Reinforced by his decision this morning not to seek again the U.S. presidency in 2008, Gore obviously has an unwavering commitment to an all-encompassing, foreboding cause even as the oil companies continue to malign the validity of his arguments.The accountability of fossil fuels has engendered such heated controversy that Gore constantly seems on the edge of becoming a political pariah in contrast to more media-attuned topics such as terrorism and the economy. Even so, I was not expecting to be so enthralled by what is essentially a slide show that he estimates he has given over one thousand times in sixteen years on the perils of global warming. I am happy to report that first-time feature director Davis Guggenheim has done a superb job in capturing Gore's veracity and personal dedication with vigor and candor.Guggenheim reveals not only a Gore with foibles and a level of humanism missing from his previous media appearances but also an eye-opening look at the climatic chaos that Gore believes is quite fixable. In certain ways, the documentary is like watching a filmed record of a one-man Broadway show after the mandatory out-of-town tryouts. The result is polished in the best sense with an even-keeled pacing and a clear-eyed presentation of findings that increase in scope and personal proximity. The off-the-chart graphics presented are startling, for instance, the ten warmest years on record have all occurred since 1990 with 2005 the warmest on record. South America experienced its first hurricane off the coast of Brazil this past year, and an unprecedented number of typhoons have recently hit Japan.Gore shows comparative photos of the world's glaciers dramatically receding over the years, and also how a substantial piece of the Antarctic ice shelf has suddenly collapsed. His meticulous tracking of Katrina is revealing for the preventative measures that were ignored by political naysayers. He provides evidence of Greenland on the brink of a significant meltdown that would raise the global water level by twenty feet and then goes on to show the consequences in topographic maps of southern Florida, the San Francisco Bay Area, Lower Manhattan, Beijing, Shanghai and the Ganges River delta, areas where hundreds of millions will be permanently displaced.For all the palpable visions of Armageddon, the most surprising finding is the difference in press coverage between the scientific community and the mass media around the subject.  Gore shares that there have been a total of 928 peer-reviewed papers supporting global warming according to a 2004 Science Magazine survey of all scientific studies of climate change. Meanwhile, a similar sample of stories from the mass media showed that a whopping 53 percent claim global warming is unproven, a belief hammered home by Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, who is shown in the film stating emphatically that global warming is all a hoax. Inholfe could perhaps have greater credibility if the U.S. was not responsible for over thirty percent of the world's greenhouse gas pollution.Perhaps Guggenheim's most noteworthy accomplishment is not turning the film into a political commercial for Gore. With the possible exception of an extended sequence where Gore shares his devastation after his controversial defeat for the U.S. presidency in 2000, there is a refreshing lack of pandering, as the former Vice President shares personal recollections - his childhood on a tobacco farm, his sister's death from lung cancer, his son's near-fatal accident - that make his perspective all the more resonant. Although I wish there was greater prominence to proactive steps than the end credit crawl, the film at least identifies them in quick order for viewers to start diverting the trend. This is essential viewing for anyone who mistakenly believes global warming is a partisan issue."	5.0	Gore Opens a Vital Door to a Period of Consequence in Thwarting Global Warming	2006-06-04	35	25	10
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2LO2V7J187BE2	E. Hens	Though the idea of having to watch a 90 minute 'slide show' on a difficult subject may sound boring, it is not!Al Gore knows exactly what he is talking about and yes, to make his points he needs to use some sophisticated presentation techniques.But the delicate balance between switching from the presentation to facts about his personal life and back, is very well done.For those who don't want to believe the facts : it is like using a veto => it puts an end to any discussion.Some people have an attitude of dealing with problems at the time they occur.But in this case, this attitude will result in being too late, much too late.At least, too late to create 'human' solutions to the problem. Because at that time, for many of us, the question will no longer be 'How do we live?' but 'How do we survive?'And if you look at how e.g. animals are dealing with survival, their actions can be very drastic in order to survive (are we prepared to sacrifice the life of our own children?).Preventing a fire is better than firefighting.If we can prevent having to end up with a struggle to survive, by all means, let's do it now!Thanks to Carl Sagan for having that picture taken of Earth from a 4 billion mile distance; and thanks to Al Gore for showing it to us.I hope history will be able to tell in the not so far future that another similar picture taken then, will still show that tiny pixel size earth being true blue!In short :  'An inconvenient truth' is highly recommended!	5.0	No time to waste	2006-11-03	21	15	6

The information and data presenting the facts for global warming are undeniable.  Yes, everyone needs to hear these facts and heed the call to action.  However, 50 percent of the film seemed to be a political agenda platform for Gore as well as a personal biography.  He flashed pictures of recent republican presidents as parties against action.  He neglected to mention Clinton's 8 years of non-action.  It definitely had a democrat versus republican based hidden agenda.  I visited wikipedia to lean more about Kyoto after viewing the film.  Here it discussed both Bush & Clinton administrations and the US position.  The global warming information was great in the film.  The implication republicans are against action was disappointing, not true, and unfair.  With the big election coming in the near future I guess I shouldn't have been surprised.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1GBVCADZBO8YG	Emc2	"Disclaimer: Sorry! This review is neither a smear critic nor a bipartisan analysis of U.S. politics. You can find that in several of the other reviews below. If such is your interest, you may skip this review.In all fairness, I think the review of Gore's documentary must be divided in two separate parts, the public message delivery and the accuracy of the science he presented in AIT. The latter discussion is aimed only for those with objective and genuine interest in the reliability of the facts and science presented by Gore.---AIT as a mean for environmental awareness---Without a doubt, AIT achieved its purpose. The product is an excellent means for raising public awareness about the importance of taking care of our Pale Blue Dot, particularly for Global Warming (GW), and a welcomed sermon for the converted. The sales pitch is so good that my guess is that even some of those of the doubtful will at least pay more attention to the environmental movement. Gore explicitly tried to use Carl Sagan's style for delivering complex science to the public in simple terms, even with several references to Sagan's work in the opening of AIT. But whether you like it or not, Sagan never exaggerated the scientific facts, and when extrapolating or making educated guesses, he explicitly said so. This is a minor sin that in principle may be forgivable, because the message delivery in AIT uses all the typical resources of public awareness campaigns, such us oversimplification, exaggeration of the facts, alarmism, catastrophic prophecies to create fear, and putting unrelated facts together (this was a repeated offender in AIT, such as tropical diseases unrelated to GW -Ebola, Nile Virus, etc-, or talking about future rising sea levels and immediately illustrating flooding all over the world with an estimate of an outdated worst-case scenario of the 90s). You find all these elements in public campaigns such as anti-tobacco, DUI and drugs awareness, and HIV/AIDS prevention, etc. These public awareness messages usually don't go into the accurate scientific details because not everybody will understand, the message will be confusing, and so, the delivery has to be strong, clear and simple. This approach has proved effective to modify individual behavior. Al Gore unquestionably achieved that. The film director dealt quite properly to make a PowerPoint presentation into an interesting and dynamic documentary, making sure that not everybody will fall asleep. To complete the package, the DVD has an update on GW, and even a errata (regarding the frequency of hurricanes).The capital sin regarding the message delivery has to do with Gore's insistence on putting personal facts, and even worst, the flashback to the 2000 Election. The message for Americans should have not been bipartisan at all; there Gore lost an important audience, and woke up old quarrels, perfectly reflected by many of the reviews below. Gore couldn't resist the mistake of politicizing science. Unfortunately, an important issue like Global Warming ends up being discussed with name-calling, insults, smearing and no criticism is allowed. The issue is being debated as if it was a political or religious issue. It became us against them. It's a shame you don't have the right to disagree or ask any question, especially when we are talking about science, which paradoxically, welcomes and depends on skepticism and criticism to separate good science from bogus science. As Carl Sagan used to say, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Thus, in science, the burden of the proof is on those making the claim, regardless of political beliefs. And this concept is valid also for the theory of Global Warming, yes theory! GW theory is far from having solid scientific bases to allow making accurate predictions, such it is possible in astronomy, rocket science or even engineering in general. There are still plenty of uncertainties, and climate scientists are just more comfortable with the present state of knowledge and improvements made during the last ten years. But as explained below, GW is still a work in progress.Instead of the embarrassing blunder of politicizing GW, Gore lost the opportunity to use film time in making more explicit and explaining in detail the US responsibility and unbalanced contribution to atmospheric pollution. Americans represent 4,6% of the world population but produce 30% of the greenhouse gases, and about a third of it just coming from transportation. Just auto travel alone represents 90% of all trips in the US. At least more time could have been used to explain how to mitigate this problem. But, deepening in this subject is definitively not politically convenient. Unpopular measures definitively won't win an election. These measures might include rising the driving age to 18; increasing parking and auto related taxes; charging tolls for entering downtown at peak periods (such as London and Singapore already do); improvement and incentives for using mass transit; and heavy investment for serious research and development of new environmentally friendly fuels. Gore could have mentioned that Brazil already has a viable ethanol market for autos including the option of flexible cars (working on any combination of alcohol and gasoline) and without subsidies for the farmers. Unfortunately, as Joseph Stiglitz said in this latest book, Making Globalization Work, ""...those who pollute the most always tend to minimize the problem. It is not surprising that the world's polluter, the United States ... pretends that it does not believe the evidence that there is a need to curtail its greenhouse gas emissions.""  And let's not forget that the private use of automobiles creates other social problems, for the economy (time and money lost in traffic congestion) and in the health sector (death and injured people from traffic accidents, and respiratory diseases caused by air pollution from cars). Since the seventies, there is plenty of research, papers and recommendations for mitigating the problem, but auto travel is so convenient!---The accuracy of the science in AIT---A quick review of the state-of-the-art on GW and climate change (UN's IPCC 2007 Report and others sources) shows that even though climate models and climate predictions have improved a lot since the 90s, and there is consensus by most climate scientists regarding these predictions, ""...Confidence in these estimates is higher for some climate variables (e.g. temperature) than for others (e.g. precipitation)"". Climate is a non-linear system, difficult to deal with and naturally some uncertainties remains. These uncertainties and contradictory measurements can be group on four issues: (i) limited existing data sets available show that temperature in the interior of the Antarctica continent has actually been declining in the last few years and that the ice sheet is getting thicker (yes!, check on Gore's companion book). Simulation biases have been found  by IPCC in most models' simulation of the Southern Ocean (Antarctica). Since the Southern Ocean is important for ocean heat uptake, this results in some uncertainty in transient climate response (simple translation: how the temperature will change due to CO2 increase); (ii) any simulation model has limitations, and in the case of GW, you also have the challenge to make predictions to establish how to world (population, technology, economy, etc.) is going to be a 100 years from now in order to estimate future CO2 emissions. The pool of 18 climate models reviewed by the IPCC showed weaknesses or larger than desirable margins of errors, mainly on estimating rain precipitation in extreme events, and more important, in understanding cloud and ice masses feedbacks (reflection of radiation), all key factors for accurate climate predictions and warming of the atmosphere; (iii) there is still debate about the interpretation of the data originated from the ice core taken at Antarctica, at a better resolution scale the data seems to indicate that during the 650 K years shown by Gore's presentation, temperatures went up first and the CO2 increase followed as a consequence of the higher temperature, and not the opposite; if that is the case, then this data set is not compatible with the modern CO2 increment; and (iv) AIT presented increases in sea level corresponding to the simulation models of the 90's, now known for a tendency to overestimate the effects of GW, the new IPPC Report presents more moderate forecasts on future sea levels due to GW, just a fraction of those presented by Gore.Due to the space limits, I will just go into detail on one of the key uncertainty factors. The following is taken from the IPPC 2007 Report. Cloud feedbacks have been confirmed as a primary source of differences in climate models predictions, particularly in the tropical regions: ""Cloud feedback is the coupling between cloudiness and surface air temperature in which a change in surface air temperature could lead to a change in volume of clouds, which could then amplify or diminish the initial temperature perturbation. This effect is currently known to have a negative impact on the climate system. However, a changing climate may involve changes in the clouds with both positive and negative effects on the radiative balance. It is not known whether the overall effect of cloud feedback will become a negative or positive feedback, depending on whether and how cloud cover changes. Cloud feedback could almost halve or double the surface air temperature"" And for those skeptical, a lot of research is underway to better understand the cloud feedbacks. Check through the web, NASA's Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling (TC4) field campaign just concluded a few days ago. ""Many facets of the chemical, dynamic, and physical processes occurring in the tropical upper troposphere and tropopause transitional layer are not well understood. Identifying the key processes in this region is essential for progress on issues involving global climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and global tropospheric chemistry"". This research was conducted on July and August, 2007, based on Costa Rica, and included also Colombia, Ecuador and Panama. The TC4 Costa Rican campaign used 7 NASA satellites and 3 NASA aircraft.Climate is a complex system we still don't fully understand, but we have much to loose by not taking action now. It would just be nice if the real facts were presented, with associated risks, uncertainties and margins of error, not with exaggerations, but unfortunately public awareness campaigns tend to be always like this.Full Disclosure: I do not have any interest on polluting industries, but just on preserving our Blue Planet for future generations and in keeping a skeptic and scientific attitude toward Global Warming. This review did not pretend to be a lecture on climate, nor I am an expert on climate, but with a basic knowledge of scientific principles, a little bit of understanding of physics, some basic familiarity with real simulation models, and enough curiosity and skepticism should be enough to help you reach your own conclusions. Hopefully, the tools are available to anyone in the world; you can just check the facts by yourself through the web and make up your own judgment. A good starting point for more details on the science behind Global Warming is a Wikipedia search for ""An Inconvenient Truth"" and ""State of Fear"" (the controversial novel by Michael Crichton that Gore took the time to make some rebuttal in the companion book). Read the critics of both, and follow the links. Available also through the web, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007 Report is a must if you are really serious about the subject of GW, read Chapter 8, that presents Climate Models and their evaluation. Check also the 2001 IPCC report, to see how the science and the consensus has changed over time. Also Michael Crichton's speeches ""Environmentalism as Religion"" and ""The Case for Skepticism on Global Warming"" are recommended (both transcriptions can be found at MC's web site). If you want to understand the basics of computer simulation, Wikipedia has a good summary. But be aware, when using computers models, if garbage goes in garbage comes out....PS: as suggested by a fellow Amazonian (see comments), The Future of Everything: The Science of Prediction (Apollo's Arrow in the Canadian version) by David Orrell is an objective critical analysis of climate modeling for future predictions, including also analysis of modeling in the fields of health and economics, and how they relate to climate prediction in the long-term. This book also presents a brief but very comprehensive summary of the philosophy and history of science, including meteorology and weather forcasting. If your are genuinely interested in the limitations of the science behind Global Warming, this book is a must-read. Also highly recommended is ""Global Warming - Myth or Reality?: The Erring Ways of Climatology"" by Marcel Leroux (too bad this is an expensive book!). And sorry, a Nobel Prize does not validate the science. Gore and the IPCC scientists were awarded because they raised the awareness about the environment, and influenced the political agenda of several countries."	3.0	The Unbiased Truth: Excellent for raising public awareness, but Sagan would have been more rigorous on the science	2007-08-14	9	5	4

The science is sound and the predictions are overwhealming. The issue at stake is our ability to survive as a civilization in the next centuries. One of the most important and encouraging messages of this ""must see documentary"" is that if we act quickly and decisively on a global scale we can curb the climate change and maybe prevent reaching a point of no return scenarios. We can and must invest in the future of the next generations. Global warming is not a problem of the future its a problem of now as it takes several decades to see the effects due to climatic inertia. The movie and associated websites inform the public on how we can act to slow global warming and help out by individual choices. It is encouraging that Al Gore , due to ""an incovenient truth""  and his role in studying and transmiting this information, has already received nominations for a Novel Price and several other world recognized awards. Moreover, his conclusions are supported by major scietific and economic reviews such as the Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change 2007 in Paris and the Stern Review from the UK.I thoroughly encourage everybody to see this masterpiece and to encourage their friend and relatives to see it as well.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2D8CUJPOSRPNA	Erik North	"The winner of the 2006 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature, AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH makes an extremely concise and persuasive case regarding one of the great issues in the history of the human race.  That issue is global warming, and the largely uncontested fact that the billions of people on this planet are doing serious damage to their home by causing it.Filmed by noted TV director Davis Guggenheim, AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH spotlights the crusade taken on by former Vice-President Al Gore to make the issue of global warming THE paramount issue of our time.  And given all that we've seen firsthand around the world (droughts in Africa; the melting of glaciers; the devastation of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina; and dozens of U.S. cities breaking all-time heat records during the summer of 2005), there is very little doubt that unchecked human activity is the culprit.  Gore himself reflects on how his time in public office and his many decades of studying this problem forced him into action, and how so many of his colleagues in Washington, most of them beholden to Big Oil, were so blithely brushing off global warming as ""the biggest hoax ever perpetrated.""  But the facts he shows us in his PowerPoint presentations, plus first-hand evidence in those parts of the world hardest hit by the dramatic climate changes that global warming has wrought so far are extremely difficult to ignore.Often thought of as stiff while a politician, Gore is now something of a modern-day sage (except, of course, to those on the political and corporate far-right, who still view him as a threat),  With Mr, Guggenheim's help, he makes the case for solving global warming very clear in AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH.  The means to combat this problem are in our hands right now--it only requires the will to make them happen.  And all the complaints that automakers and big corporations make about how such changes will negatively impact the economy are soundly debunked here.In a time where there have been numerous documentary films that have made a huge commercial, cinematic, and emotional impact, AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH makes its case particularly clear: We humans need to change the way we live, so that fifty or a hundred years from now, we're not faced with a global crisis that may never be solved.  And on that level, it's a masterpiece of its kind."	5.0	Confronting Global Warming...TODAY!	2007-04-23	13	7	6

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1RKUIW5NMXNUI	E. Stolberg	"I found this documentary to be a very eye-opening experience. Al Gore and his crew do an excellent job presenting the straight facts on the issue of global warming. The earth's atmosphere is very thing and it does not take much to alter it. The facts were laid squarely on the table by Gore. 2005 was the worst year of severe weather reported in the United States in history. The number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes has almost doubled in the last 30 years. Global sea levels could rise by more than 20 feet with the loss of shelf ice in Greenland and Antarctica, devastating coastal areas worldwide. The Arctic Ocean could be ice free in summer by 2050. Due to the increase in heat, the soil would lose moisture much quicker, thus resulting in heat waves, droughts, and wildfires being more frequent and more intense. This almost definitely would affect the animal population. At least 279 species of plants and animals are already responding to global warming, moving closer to the poles, with a possibility of more than a million species worldwide driven to extinction by 2050. Diseases have become more rampant. Malaria has already spread to higher altitudes in places like the Columbian Andes, 7,000 feet above sea level. Deaths from global warming will double in just 25 years -- to 300,000 people a year. This is a real issue that we need to deal with promptly, or risk the consequences. I felt the movie was best summarized by this quote given by Gore: ""We can no longer afford to view global warming as a political issue - rather, it is the biggest moral challenge facing our global civilization."""	5.0	My thoughts...	2007-08-19	5	2	3
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A17IDP37NM8TFJ	Eugene Chamson	"When they write the history of our Civilization, this film will take its place along with Gore's earlier book, ""Earth in the Balance"" as milestones in the evolution of American thought and consciousness on global warming.  Unfortunately, the film, which does a good job at describing the seriousness of problem, never rises above simplistic solutions which are doomed to failure.By now, most of us have heard of global warming.  We've been told that our use of fossil fuels emits CO2 gases into the atmosphere which trap the suns rays, heating the planet up like a greenhouse.  So maybe the temperature of the Earth has gone up a degree.  So what?  We've all got more pressing problems to worry about, right?""An Inconvenient Truth"" is designed to shock us into awareness that the changes that are happening are dramatic, and if unchanged, cataclysmic.  Gore uses the analogy of a frog placed in a pot of water.  If the water is heated gradually, the frog will be boiled alive before it notices.  Similarly, the changes to our environment seem so subtle and gradual to us that we are lulled into inaction, but meanwhile processes are underway that could result in tremendous destruction.This is essentially a film about a slide presentation on global warming that Gore has given, he says, over 1000 times.  The film expands on the points in the slide show with footage of exotic locales, as well as personal reflections by Gore about his lifelong relationship with the topic of global warming.  Yes, it's a documentary, but it's well-made, and its topic and predictions are so dramatic, that it holds our attention until the end.This is Gore at his best: intelligent, articulate, clever, charming, even passionate at times.  What gives the film its credibility is the personal relationship between Gore and the topic of global warming.  We see the emergence and growing importance of the topic through the prism of Gore's life.  Starting from when he first learned about the new theory of global warming as a student nearly 40 years ago through today, we track Gore's --and our-- growing understanding of the effects and consequences of the planet's warming.There are plenty of charts, figures and statistics to impress any layman.  But most dramatic and convincing are the photos of various locations a generation ago and today.  We see glaciers that have disappeared, snows that have melted, huge lakes that have evaporated into deserts, and ice packs that are breaking up.  Clearly, changes are occurring.But then the film makes a subtle transition-- from what has occurred to what will occur.  Gore gives his forecasts with the same confidence as his history, lulling the casual viewer into accepting that they carry the same degree of certainty.  And if we didn't get it already, this is where we learn that this isn't just another Nova science film, this is a film with a mission.  As Gore proclaims, ""this is a MORAL issue"", by which he means there are things we should be doing.Unfortunately, this is where the film is the weakest.  Gore pronounces that when the ice of Greenland melts, or half the ice of Antarctica melts, it will raise sea levels 20 feet.  We then see very dramatic graphic effects of how this will alter coastlines in heavily populated areas of the Earth.  Hundreds of millions will be at risk.  But is this going to happen suddenly in the next few years? Or gradually over the next few centuries?  Gore doesn't say.  Probably because no one knows.  And are there self-correcting mechanisms that could slow or reverse the effects of global warming, such as the growing scarcity of fossil fuels and the likely evolution to other sources of energy in the coming decades?And here we get to the ""inconvenient truth"" that mars the film's mission:  It's difficult to ask people to make certain sacrifices today when the future benefits of those sacrifices remain unclear or controversial at best.  For example, most of the people who see this film will be receptive to idea of switching from a gas guzzler to a vehicle like the Prius.  They will feel like they are doing the ""right thing"".  But what if it turns out that all of the benefits of this are outweighed by the millions of new cars being added every year in countries like China and India.  What if instead of asking people to switch to the Prius, we told them instead you can only drive one day a week.  Then you might see a different reaction.  When you REALLY ask people to make sacrifices, you'd better be able to tell them for sure what they're getting in return for what they are giving up.In short, the film does not do justice to the vast complexity of issues that get in the way of the world facing up to this problem.  It is not as simple as just knowing there is a problem.

It was relating the story of how his sister had died from smoking. I could see clearly the parallel he drew between the denial of harm from smoking and from pollution.

The book was interesting, but a tad dry, and all I could picture of the movie was one long, boring lecture. How wrong I was!The movie is basically a film showing Al Gore presenting his slide show to audiences, interspersed with personal information about why he chose to undertake global warming as a project. Instead of this being a boring lecture, it actually is quite interesting and Mr. Gore has a great sense of humor. There were several animated shorts included, which helped to demonstrate the concepts that were being presented.The science is basically sound, although there are several places where the science presented is now obsolete. Even though the film is only two years old, the science is moving so quickly that it would be hard to keep it fully up to date. It is, however, a good primer on the science behind global warming and how scientists became interested in the subject to begin with.While hardly the end all of global warming science, the movie is well done and provides for a base understanding of the subject. It is perfect viewing for those with little background in science that want to get a handle on the subject.	4.0	A Very Interesting Movie Showing Basic Science Principals	2008-02-22	6	3	3

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2LUN275GRCD96	"Fredrick P. Wilson ""shinano01"""	This is the movie that won the Nobel  and a couple of Oscars for Al Gore in 2007.It is amazing, when you play to the emotions of the politically correct crowd with, of all the darn things, a slide presentation that purports to represent science, you win awards. No one asks if the science has any validity. No one asks why the presenter is presenting one untruth after another. There is an answer for that from these folks; it is the title of the movie, and the assertion that those who oppose this movie are deniers, like the folks who ran the tobacco companies, who denied the truth. It is time to pull the curtain back, and find out that OZ is the emperor who is wearing no clothes. It is just unknown whether Al Gore is OZ, or if someone else is pulling his strings.A little way into the movie two graphs are shown that run across the screen, one on top of another. The top graph is the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, and the lower graph is the earth's temperature. The data is from a Siberian ice core and goes back 600 years. Al says that the two graphs look like each other, and says that CO2 causes the temperature to change.Open question, why didn't he make the graphs in much shorter time frames, like 50,000 year increments, show 12 graphs then, make the lines much finer, and show them actually on top of each other?If he did that, the actual data from those very same ice cores would show that the temperature goes up or down, and then the CO2 level goes up or down 800 to 1000 years later. In other words, the temperature causes the CO2 level to change, not the backwards, upside down, untruthful way that Al Gore presents it. The CO2 level is a trailing indicator of what the temperature has already done. Nothing more.The first question to ask with the real data really presented properly, is why did Al get it wrong? Did he not ask the right questions? Did someone else give him this data and he just swallowed without asking any critical, scientific questions?The second question is: if CO2 doesn't cause climate change AKA global warming, what does? The rest of the movie is just the rest of the wheels falling off the Global Warming wagon, and this movie.In the same graph he projects a rise in CO2 this century (21st) almost vertically to unprecedented levels, with the assertion that the temperature must also climb vertically, and we will all melt (like we do every summer).The scale of the graph is incredibly misleading. What is really happening is that 1,000 years ago was the medieval warming, and here we are, 1,000 years later, watching the CO2 level rise.Something not presented in this data is that although the CO2 level that is increasing, as Al Gore shows earlier in this film, and we know about how much CO2 mankind in contributing, the actual, scientifically measured at the top of Mauna Loa by NASA, atmospheric level of CO2 is rising only about one-half as fast as it should be. No alarmist scientist will admit this, and they don't know what is happening to the CO2. SeeClimate: The Counter-Consensus - A  Palaeoclimatologist  Speaks (Independent Minds).Al Gore also shows the infamous Mann curve, (the Mann hockey stick) which purports to show 1,000 years of Northern Hemisphere temperatures. The curve is fairly flat, and then it rises dramatically in the last 60 years or so. This curve has subsequently (2009) been completely debunked (seeThe Hockey Stick Illusion: Climategate and the Corruption of Science (Independent Minds). Mann has been quite ungracious about how he (deliberately?) manipulated the scientific code to minimize and distort all of the data, starting with the medieval warming period, which was several degrees warmer than today, minimized and distorted the little ice age, and then did not show that global temperatures started recovering around 1700AD, and have been slowly rising since then. The little ice age ended circa 1850AD. Mann's curve does not show the cooling that took place from circa 1940 through 1979, and the cooling that has actually taken place, per NASA satellite measurements, from 1999 through 2012. Why did Mann distort the data, and manipulate the code such that your grandma's cookie recipe would result in a hockey stick shaped graph. How was this absolute untruth presented to Al Gore? Why did he buy something that was absolutely false based on existing data before he made this movie?Of course, the alarmists still believe the Mann curve is correct, as Mann still asserts. Science deniers, one and all.Another false graph is the temperature since 1860, which does not show how the temperature has been slowly, unevenly, declining after 1998. Gore asserts that 2005 is the hottest year recorded during this time. That is an absolute untruth. Per NASA satellite data. Which was available in 2005. Why the distortion, manipulation of actual scientific data? Alarmists like to say something like 11 of the warmest years have been in the last 13 years, and that the absolute 5 warmest are 2005, 1998, 2002, 2003, and 2007. Once again, with the exception of 1998, this is absolutely false, invented, data. Did no one bother to go back to NASA and check their actual measurements? (SeeWhat Warming?: Satellite View of Global Temperature Change).Climategate happened in late 2009, so Al Gore can't be blamed, but it is emblematic of the entire movement of which Gore is major player. Climategate was a bunch of E-mails from the alarmist cabal at East Anglia University, the main suppliers of information to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to each other. There were two main issues. The first, is how could they present the data to show that there actually was global warming, when there had been no global warming since 1998. I.E., how could they manipulate the data to fool the public. The second, was that they deliberately manipulated computer code to display the data, no matter what it was, the way they wanted it to turn out. They are not scientists, they are charlatans who should be tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail!The preceding folks should give everyone pause about everything presented in this movie.Al starts out with pictures of the earth from space, and how fragile our planet is. He then covers some real simple, almost childish, basics about the sun and our atmosphere. Then he hits the graphs, as outlined previously. Included within are pictures of ice melting. Mount Kilimanjaro, in Africa, has a snowy top. The snow coverage has been declining. However, not because Kilimanjaro is not cold enough, but rather because of moisture wind patterns that have little or nothing to do with climate change.He shows pictures of glaciers and arctic ice. Yes, some glaciers are melting. Others are growing. We have been warmer before, and the glaciers did just fine. We are not going to inundate our oceans with a sudden surge of fresh water that will destroy the oceans circulation patterns. Arctic ice minimized in 2007, in time to win a Nobel. Since then the arctic ice has been slowly increasing. During the medieval warming, Chinese ships sailed across the arctic and saw no ice. No ice is no problem. He talks about, and shows, polar bears swimming forever, and not finding any ice. Polar bears are doing just fine, their numbers have increased dramatically over the last 50 years or so. They did fine 1,000 years ago, they have done fine for millions of years, and they are doing fine today. What is not good is a real ice age, with glaciers a mile high, as Gore explains, but he doesn't explain that Polar Bears, and mankind, really don't do so good during cold periods, and we do great during warming periods, such as the current time. He believes the Antarctic's ice is also melting because a couple of ice shelves fell into the ocean. As they have done before. They rebuild, and then they fall into the ocean again. Yawn. So what.Katrina (the hurricane) was bad. Mainly it showed that a city that is below sea level that doesn't pay enough attention to its dykes is going to run into trouble. Katrina was not especially powerful, and if it had hit anywhere else, it would have been a normal bad hurricane. The assumption that global warming, the warm waters of the gulf, are the primary causative factor for hurricane formation is flat out false. Of course all the years since 2005 have shown a decline in Hurricane activity and intensity. 2005 was not especially abnormal, except for Katrina hitting New Orleans just wrong.He shows a graph of population, showing it peaking out at around 9.1 billion people circa 2050. The indicated belief is that there are too many people on the earth for our resources. Current UN data indicates that it will peak around 2050 at about 8 billion people, and then start declining as Europe, the Middle East, Japan, and some other areas and countries start demographically disappearing. Having a whole continent with no people on it, except Islamists, as Europe will be next century, will be a whole new and entirely too interesting a challenge.He thinks that diseases will move north and cause epidemics. Insects and other species will migrate and upset the balance everywhere.Our ancestors, in Egypt in 2300BC, in Greece, in 1250BC, in Rome, in 1AD, in Europe in 1200AD, were all in warm eras, lived through everything Al Gore is decrying, and all thrived until the cold temperatures came back. We have been here before and we have survived just fine. During the Pliocene, the current inter-glacial period, it was warmer 10,000 years ago, and has been slowly cooling since then. No year, with or without man made CO2, has been or will be as warm as 10,000 years ago.Over 85% of the earth's global warming is actually caused by water vapor, with that mostly happening within 30 feet of the earth's surface. Only 0.2% is caused by CO2. Al Gore is chasing a chimera. Of course, trying to do something about water vapor is just not sexy. You can't destroy modern civilization by working on water vapor.Taking the long view, CO2 concentrations 150 million years ago, during warm and cold periods, was over 4,000PPM, 15 times higher than today, and the dinosaurs did just fine. The Earth should have dies, per Al. But we are here today. Oops!Al quotes a study done that shows that there is a consensus of scientists that support global warming caused by man. The study was a Google search. It is meaningless. There is no scientific consensus, there has been no consensus, and there will be never be a consensus. Besides, a consensus is meaningless. What matters is the science. A consensus of scientists means that nobody is thinking anymore.Al Gore relaters the story of the Tobacco Company executives and their testimony before congress. The executives all stated that there was doubt about the science that tobacco was bad for you, and he equates the folks like me, who actually know the science, with those executives, thus we are called deniers. I would urge everyone to read The Deniers, which is about scientists who knew, in their narrow field, that there was no global warming, but thought overall there was, until they compared notes with other scientists, and found out it was all a house of falsehoods.This movie is a total sham: a fabrication. Did Al Gore deliberately manipulate the data, or did he just uncritically accept the deliberately manipulated data? What matters is that the Alarmists are wrong now, they will be wrong tomorrow, and they are the real, malevolent, science deniers.	1.0	Deliberately - Malevolently Manipulated Scientific Data	2012-06-20	19	8	11
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A36SSF310LBGSE	freedom78	"After reading a number of negative reviews, it occurred to me that many are missing a key point of this film, that being that the Earth is tremendously complex, and that global warming presents problems that reach far beyond melting ice. While many of the effects of global warming are less than fully documented and scientifically validated, as critics are quick to point out, those who view this film as being purely political propaganda are reflecting their own biases more so than Mr. Gore's. I found this documentary to be very informative and entertaining. While Gore's personality is often referred to as ""still"" or ""decaf,"" he seems less so in this film than he did on the campaign trail, and at times he's witty and folksy. The documentary does have a political bent to it, without question, but that reflects less on Gore's speeches on the issue and more on the choices of the filmmaker to put this in a political context. And Gore's political references have less to do with Republicans and Democrats than with a general political culture that does not handle a problem until it grows to gargantuan proportions. My sole complaint about this film is that it focuses almost entirely on causes and (sometimes potential) effects, rather than solutions. This is to a purpose. His case is meant to tie enough issues to global warming that it simply overwhelms objections. If you view this film with an open mind, as I tried to do, it's an interesting and informative, but not entirely unbiased look at what is quickly becoming a critical issue. If you come into it aggressive in defense of your own biases that this is a non-issue, then you'll likely not enjoy it."	4.0	Watch with an open mind	2008-03-09	6	2	4

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2HWD9PTM7RBXN	G. J Wiener	Our environment is definitely changing.  Whereas I appreciate warm weather to cold, the commentary in An Inconvenient Truth addresses how too much warmth from too much Carbon Dioide getting through to earth is not good at all.  The pictures of how the deteoriating glaciers from around the world will lead to a massive water shortage.  With world population increasing rapidly especially in areas such as India and China, the not so distant future does look a bit bleak.  What happens if the sea level shrinks?  More importantly what can we do about all of this?  The suggestions at the end of the movie are a start.  However politicans both democratic and republican need to pay closer attention.  All those charts seem to show an obvious trend.I am usually not much for a long political lecture.  However, Al Gore is very organized in his speech with many charts and examples that illustrate his point.  This movie certainly can serve as a long term reference guide for all of us as we should be aware of our chanigng climate.	5.0	Informative Commentary	2007-01-21	7	4	3
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A17IW44FV0HUTY	Glen Engel Cox	"Al Gore won't win an Academy Award, but this documentary based on his slideshow about global warming will.  For what this documentary does is what film does best: it takes a difficult topic--that has years of accumulated misunderstandings both real and created, both about global warming and Gore himself--and it lays the issue out cleanly, understandably, and, most importantly these days, in an entertaining fashion.  This is how the best scientific presentations should be done, with humor, with facts, and with a call for action.  Gore may have lost the presidency (the early joke in the movie is when he introduces himself as ""the former future President of the United States""), but he has gained a calling, and that may have been the best thing for our world.There's nothing about the science presented in _An Inconvenient Truth_ that is new.  Even those things that Gore presents to his on-screen audience as ""an image that not many people have seen before,"" have now been seen by quite a number of people (including the increasing number of people seeing this movie).  What makes this movie, and Gore's presentation, so effective is that he puts it all together, in a coherent story, that effectively showcases each puzzle piece in both time and importance.  The seeds of doubt that have been so effectively manipulated by those who do not wish to deal with global warming grow in the thin soil of radio talk shows and late night soundbites.  Given an hour-and-a-half, Gore's argument and his passion for his subject overcome those limitations, answering both his critics and the critics of global warming.For this documentary is about Al Gore as much as it is about the inconvenient truth of the title, for Gore provides the human side of this scientific equation, standing in for every American who has to understand how much of an inconvenience this is.  He connects it to an early accident involving his son, that helped him step back from his life and examine what he considered important.  He connects to his family's legacy as Tennessee tobacco farmers, who knew about the dangers of tobacco, yet continued to grow it until smoking caused the death of his sister, forcing them to evaluate their choice.  And he connects it to the last five years, by revealing global warming as a threat that is as important, if not more so, than global terrorism.Moreover, rather than simply being the Chicken Little that he and his global warming scientist friends are portrayed to be, Gore shows that, while the sky may indeed be falling, it's not the end of the world.  The warning signs are there, but it is not irreversable.  There are things that we can do.  And this is where the inconvenience of the title comes through the clearest because the choices we make to reverse global warming are not convenient.  As he states in his presentation, ""It is amazing to me how so many people go straight from denial to despair,"" referring to how so many people, once confronted with the reality of how humans have affected a global system proceed to throw up their hands and say that nothing can be done.  Gore's call-to-arms is in stark contrast to his former opponent's own call-to-arms in his war: Bush, on the verge of the ""war against terrorism,"" when asked what the country could do, encouraged people to go spend, so as to keep our economy strong.  Gore admits that in fighting global warming, the actions will be more difficult, but he compares this to the great battles of our past: the American Revolution and its hardships, the great cost of the Civil War, and the rationing and victory gardens of World War II.  When faced with a great challenge, Gore says, Americans have come together and overcome it by their collective action before, and they can again.  And, in the case of global warming, he shows that it is our moral imperative as citizens of the country that is contributing the most to this problem, not to mention our ethical response as human citizens of the world.I'm sure that Sunday morning will be filled with pundits blathering on about ""Gore's crusade"" and environmental extremism, as will the nattering nabobs of negativism on the radio.  Rather than making your decision based upon their opinions--for you have no idea where their real motivations lie--I urge you, instead, to go see Mr. Gore's movie, to spend just 90 minutes on a subject that has real consequences for all of us.  Freed of his political aspirations and provided with another six years of hard data that matches the scientific model forecasts, Gore is able to speak with mounting passion about global warming in such a way that reveals to everyone his emotional core.  That is why this movie will win an Oscar, and--I hope--will help people come to grips with this very inconvenient truth."	5.0	You MUST see this	2006-07-05	41	26	15

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2R0Y9OW9ZS9HR	Gloria Purcell	I took my children and their families to see it after I saw it twice.  I bought DVDs when it came out and gave them to friends and family for Christmas.  For at least 20 years, the environmentalists have been trying to tell people and governments about global warming; it is perhaps a bit bittersweet that Al Gore finally gets the world's attention with this vital documentary--but certainly none too soon!  The subject is the most important in our world today, but the documentary itself is extremely well done, well paced and interesting to watch.  They even made sure that the production and the products were carbon-neutral!  I was fascinated by the packaging--very environmentally sound!  And Native Energy donations are an excellent way to offset or reduce your carbon footprint.  For people who are just beginning to notice, this is a wonderful introduction.  For those of us who are already working in the direction of sustainability and carbon and oil reduction, it is an inspiration.  I am deeply grateful that this documentary was made!The only lack in the movie is specific concrete suggestions for individual action.  There are some, but they are at the very end while the credits roll!  We need lots more ideas that each of us can implement, especially the less expensive ones.  It would be good to have a beginner's list, an intermediate list, and an expert list!  (At one of the showings I went to, a list of ten things was handed out--that was good, but not everyone got one.)The really great thing about some of the solutions to global warming is that they solve several problems at once--for example, if you stop shopping for anything frivolous (or at the intermediate level, stop shopping for anything at all that isn't necessary), you will help the unbalance of our global fiscal situation, slowing the drain of American dollars going out of the country.  Simultaneously, you will be helping to lessen the use of oil, which is now over the peak of easy production, to reduce atmospheric carbon, to keep landfills from filling, and to save yourself some money!  In the metropolitan area I live in, traffic is a huge problem.  Freeway construction takes a long time, and they fill as they are built, so that's no solution.  Mass transit also takes years to construct, and often is not adequate to people's needs.  Want to cut traffic in half in one day, and also cut air pollution in half, and save yourself some significant money?  Carpool with just one other person!  This will also reduce the expense of road surface maintenance, by the way, and lessen the cursed potholes!Of course--you can tell!--I strongly recommend this movie!  If you have heard from the radio voices--who ARE these people?  What are their scientific credentials??--that global warming is not happening, or a hoax, or whatever they are saying, you truly owe it to yourself to see this movie, at the very least--and do some personal research from there.  There are many excellent websites on climate change and interconnected matters.  There are also many action groups that we all can join; it WILL take all of us!Gloria Purcell	5.0	Everyone needs to see this!	2007-01-09	5	4	1
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A328S9RN3U5M68	Grady Harp	Al Gore created the film AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH as an important step to alert the global audience to the threat of global warming that is all too terrifying.  Some may dismiss this well-made documentary as Gore's reaction to the election debacle that placed our current 'President' in an undeserved office, but that is just another true piece of this alerting film.  Gore is the preacher/prophet here and he comes off as an admirable, warm, human, wise teacher whose mission is to bring us all into action.The facts are now clear, thanks in many ways to both Gore's book and film.  Gore takes the role of professor here and demonstrates by graphs and charts and then terrifyingly real photographic comparative images just how endangered our planet really is.  This may not be a film that allows us to put our heads on restful pillows at night, but then that is the purpose.  Without threats, without shouting from the pulpit, Gore merely relays the facts, negates the skeptics, and finally extends his hand to show each of us how we can participate in change, be that change communicating with our government officials to take immediate action or how to convert our own walking atmosphere into a healing place.Art has always opened the windows of light on society's foibles.  AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH does just that and now that the DVD is out perhaps even broader coverage of this disastrous situation will find its way into the homes of everyone.

It is presented by Al Gore with intelligent, heartfelt honesty, a little humor and a lot of facts in easy to understand graphs, photography and film.  Gore covers climate and environmental changes for over six million years to illustrate in real terms how fast the current climate changes are happening. He explains why these changes are so devastating and exactly what is happening in countries all over the planet. he uses and provides evidence of scientific research, which you can find if you are willing to do the work to research his sources.  This film should be required viewing in every classroom, regardless of religion, political affiliation, personal opinions, or inconveniences.  This film is WELL WORTH the time to watch it. It exposes coverups by former President Bush and others. Get the truth, and realize what you can do about the very necessary changes this planet needs.

Thomsen ""gthomsen"""	In addition to an excellent overview presentation of the realities of global warming, this documentary offers a disarmingly human look at Al Gore - a view that should have been seen six years ago.The graphics and reasoning of his presentations are first rate. The reliance on a broad range of converging scientific studies is impressive. And contrary to early reviews of this movie in other venues, the scenes of Gore trapsing through airports, undergoing security scans, working nights in his hotel rooms, and following up on peripheral critiques of global warming helped bring home the perserverance and dedication of this man.A quick scan of negative reviews of this movie suggests strongly that the authors must have been in the lavatory when the segments they criticized were on screen.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3LU79BYMWZEW9	Gregor von Kallahann	"I just read online that President Bush has declared that he has no intention of seeing this film.  A more thoughtful chief executive might at least indicate a willingness to view a documentary featuring a former ""worthy opponent"" (although that particular term of respect for a political adversary seems to have longsince fallen out of usage) in order to better understand the issues embraced not only by said opponent but by a sizeable number of the citizenry at large.  It might suggest something like an open mind...but then that wouldn't play too well with the conservative base, would it?If the president really were to take in this thoughtful and surprisingly involving documentary, he might actually learn something--nothing that his handlers wouldn't be able to put a negative spin on, of course.  They can only be expected to discount the science and the motivations behind the film.  Already right wing columnists--as well as any number of conservative Amazon reviewers below--have launched into full attack mode and, in effect, do the Bush administration's handiwork for them.  They are quick to point out the so-called ""global cooling"" scare of the early 1970s as proof that scientists are hacks--except of course when they agree with the administration.(Some scientists WERE talking about cooling trends during that era, admittedly, but they were only just beginning to develop a consensus on meterological trends.  The science has gotten a lot more exact since then, but that hasn't stopped POLITICAL hacks like George Will from mentioning the supposed great ""global cooling"" scare of 35 years ago at every turn.)And Al Gore has anticipated their arguments and responded to them in advance throughout the course of this film and the lecture series that it documents.  He refers to them as ""alleged global warming"" deniers, people who dispute the indisputable, mainly out of economic concerns.  More generously, he refers to good men and women on both sides of the aisle who remain in denial in the face of what appears to be--if it is true--an overwhelmingly catastropic situation.And he demonstrates a certain fundamental understanding of human nature when he cites how in an earlier era the medical establishment, the government and tobacco producers lived in denial of the ""inconvenient truth"" that cigarette smoking causes cancer--and how he personally paid the price for such ignorance in losing a beloved sister to that disease.  Ingrained habit, coupled with hardcore economic interests can make for deadly intransigence in the face of overwhelming evidence.Like the graphic shows though, when you weigh your economic interests (represented by bricks of gold bullion) against the fate of the planet, hmmmm, which one DO you choose?  Kinda reminds you of the old Jack Benny ""Your-money-or-your-life"" gag.  Unfortunately, the punchline is changed.  You can't answer ""I'm thinking! I'm thinking!"" anymore.  Plainly, too many people aren't thinking at all."	5.0	A Cool Head On A Hot Topic	2006-06-27	40	22	18
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AAIL33CYCT47J	Gregory Baird	"Contrary to what at least one reviewer has said, Al Gore does NOT pose as a scientist in this documentary -- he is doing nothing more than speak as a concerned citizen who has looked into the data and wants to share what he has found.  None of the research is presented as his own.The problem is that the issue of the environment has become too politicized for anyone to listen to the actual evidence without letting their blood boil in a red state-blue state spitting contest that will get us no where fast.  But as Gore points out in this superlative documentary, the environment is not a Republican issue, and it isn't a Democratic issue either.  It's a moral imperative that every world citizen needs to acknowledge for the sake of our collective future.  I implore you, take personal politics out of it and at least listen to what he is saying!  As a sidenote, I found it very interesting to see how disillusioned Gore seems to have become with politics after years of trying (and failing) to get the environment into the American consciousness in congress and as the head of the senate.  He has come to the realization that politicians only act on policies that their voters demand them to take action on, and so he now looks to bring the environmental crisis to the attention of the American people.At the very least, I don't know how anyone can argue with the time lapse photos of glaciers receding, rivers drying up, ice shelfs melting, and entire lakes disappearing over a mere forty-year period.  It gives you the chills to SEE the climate changing over such a short period of time, and I'm befuddled that anyone could call such drastic changes ""cyclical events"" that are of no concern.  Look at the Alps in 1930 and compare them to a modern photo, then just try to tell me that there isn't something horribly wrong here.Gore presents the evidence in a reasonable, logical, extremely rational argument that hits home because it is so earnest and heartfelt beyond its scientific core.  And it isn't all doom and gloom -- Gore comes across as an optimist who really believes that we can make the necessary changes if we really make an effort.  Humanity has, after all, effected great changes in its history, and in the long run they have proved their worth -- the civil rights movement being one of the more recent examples.  Gore also shows how ""going green"" will not hurt our economy as naysayers would have you believe, but would expand it to new heights.  For example, right now American cars cannot be sold in countries like China that have enacted stricter environmental policies, so if American auto manufacturers get on the ball they can re-open international markets that have been closed to them due to our own stubbornness and short-sightedness.Technology has grown so fast, perhaps evolving so quickly that now we humans need to catch up to it.  Change is difficult to accept, as Gore readily acknowledges, but can open up a wealth of new possibilities and opportunities as it makes the world a better place for us and for future generations.  And the time for action is now -- before it is too late.  It's about time we learned to face the inconvenient truth."	5.0	An Important, Eye-opening Experience	2007-03-01	32	17	15

We have little idea of what millions of years or (even hundreds) have to do with our climate and its change.  Ice ages.  Does anyone really know when the next one is due?  On  Global warming issues, the same things apply.  We simply do not know.  Yes,  we have more people. And more dogs, cars,  garbage,  and cats I might add. Our trees are being cut, and yes, because of more people,  we do pollute  mother earth more who we should.  Oh we can destroy it,  but hopefully most of those types of morons know this.  But our earth will take of itself.  It has managed this for millions of years.  Yet,  for political reasons,  a non scientist wants to make everyone believe he has ""news""  for all of us.  There were atomic scientists who,  as we comtemplated dropping the first of two atomic bombs on Japan, seriously  thought the world might end (and the reasons has nothing to do with religion).  But it did not.  It is true, that some of Gore's ranting and clowning around does seem to make sense.  But any,  and I mean any REAL scientist of the world today,  would have produce much more evidence of this doomsday outcome Gore's insists is coming unless we stop ""being people."" Any,  pharmacist or chemist of today  (that includes me) would have to produce much more ""evidence"" to win a Nobel prize.  The destruction of our home Earth has much to do with more carbon dioxide emissions and the glaciers melting and raising seas.  What we are headed for is extremes that in weather are much more radical than the temperatures of today.  The irony is that the earth needs carbon dioxide to us to live,  but too much and you begin to play ""tilt"" with our climate.  If the polar ice caps melt,  then all of us have a problem.  Sorry Al, some USA citizens might bite into this cheap cream pie idea,  but what do you say to the peoples of  China,  India, and the the rest of the developing world...do you say..""hey,  you guys simply cannot have your  industrialized revolution like we in the US did in the 40s and 50s. ""  Sorry about that.  ""You will cause the world to end."" I know what China's answer to us would be.  I know Gore had little to do with the facts in writing this slice of garbage for all of us to be shocked by,  and they are just a guilty. But people love mother earth or they better.  The problem is we have to live here. More people are born outside the US everyday.  Taking care of our earth home had better be on all of our minds all of the time.  But not by this type of message.  Gore did not deserve to win and 99% of the people know it.  Cure AIDs or Ebola or think of ways all of the world's people could get along.  Al Gore did not deserve this award.  But like the climates he so predicts,  the world will go on.

Evidence of tropical temps in polar seabeds says that that this isn't the first time we have had global climate change.  Al Gore is convincing and passionate. To bad he only used half the facts he needs for a complete presentation.In the 1970's there was a big uproar about global COOLING, what happened to the science behind that?  Just because we get a well made argument, and a terrific film made, does not make it true.That said we do need to learn to live lightly on our planet.  We will effect the environment from living here, but can we minimize our effect?  A noble and worthwhile cause.If you want to believe that the byproducts of human occupation of this planet is evil, this presentation is for you.

The throwing out of balance of the resources of Nature throws out of balance also the lives of men.""Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1935An Inconvenient Truth is an enhanced version of a slide show Al Gore has been presenting since the 1980s.  The filmmakers preserve the bulk of Gore's lecture, refusing to dumb it down, but skillfully interweave segments from Gore's personal story.  This serves the dual purpose of keeping the audience emotionally involved, and giving viewers a break from a potential information overload.  Far from the stiff automaton parodied in the media, Gore gives a warm, compelling, and occasionally humorous presentation.There is not a single fact or date or number in Gore's presentation that's disputed by any reputable scientist.  The deniers are largely right wing political operatives, malefactors of carbon producing industries, or internet trolls who spend their time commenting on other people`s reviews.One factor unmentioned by Gore (or perhaps cut for time) is how suburban sprawl is a driving factor - - pun intended - - in the excess consumption of fossil fuels.Paramount has put its money where its mouth is by selling the DVD in relatively eco-friendly packaging."	5.0	Denial ain't just a river in Egypt	2007-01-20	9	6	3
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A20QO2RE88L616	Harold M. Belbin	This DVD does a great job of summarizing the climate change issues, what the problems are, what can be done and why the current administration has not addressed it and in fact has ignored, blocked honest information and lied about climate issues as a problem. It also addresses why the press has not kept the faith and reported this in a forth right manner.It amazes me how clear and obvious it is when you are presented the facts. Its also amazing how so many respected scientist and experts were ignored adn punished because the facts they were presenting were inconvenient to the oil companies and politicians. If acknowledged those facts would force politicians to take this seriously and DO something.Its rather embarrassing to the United States (and should be to us as voters)that we are politically ignoring this while much of the rest of the worlds governments have been doing something about pollution and climate change for years.For example, did you know that one of the most signficant reasons US made cars have trouble selling in the rest of the world is not because of competitiveness or pricing? Its because the US emission standards for US made cars are below the rest of the world, and therefore US cars do not meet those standards and cannot be sold in those countries.There would be many more jobs in the US, an auto industry that was doing well and the auto unions would have more of what they want if we could sell more cars overseas. But the current administration does not want the emission standards to rise because this would result in better fuel economy and less gas sales, hurting the administrations friends in the oil industry. What ever happened to politicians doing what is best for the electorate and all of the US? Best for the world and future children? Embarrassing.Mr Gore does a great job of making this easy to follow and its very understandable. He backs up his observations, insights and comments with facts.Read the book as well. Its fills in a lot more detail that is not possible to do in a DVD version.Thank you Mr Gore for taking the risk of this unpolpular issue and making this your cause for over 20 years.	5.0	To the point education on climate change!

If the Florida democrats had paid enough attention to the butterfly ballot and other pre-election shenanigans:1.  President Gore would have paid some attention to al-Qeada prior to 9/11.2.

We would have continued to run surpluses to finance the coming wave of retirements.4.  We would have some semblance of an actual health care strategy.5.  We would be driving homemade energy efficient vehicles, well into alternative fuels and less dependent foreign regimes and beneficial corporations for fossil fuels.6.  We would have a healthier environment accompanied by the growth of new technology industry.Yeah, Al is kinda stiff, and maybe sort of a geek.  Not very slick and not a self-assured control freak.

What I was suprised about was how engaging Al Gore was in his delivery of the information; he made it easy to follow along and did a fine job of engaging the viewer.  Even with my pre-existing knowlege of many of these issues this movie reached out grabbed me from beginning to end.  My husband who quite literally detested Al Gore prior to this movie has found a great deal of respect for him since viewing this movie and has actually been more active in trying to be more environmentally friendly.  I wish more people would put aside their political issues and take an active role in protecting the Earth and ultimately our future.  I've read reviews from the naysayers but generally they are the views of people who have done little or no research into the problem or who have been mislead by petroleum funded scientists.  I would also state that as a county we would be stronger if we had alternative fuel options and didn't need to rely on hostile countries to supply our needs.

Many other reviews point those out.  But let me ask a simple question, prefaced with reference to an AP article regarding the 2007 hurricane season:""Despite alarming predictions, the U.S. came through a second straight hurricane season virtually unscathed.""(2)My question is: if the hurricanes of 2004 and 2005 were caused by global warming, then can we say that the lack of hurricanes in 2006 and 2007 was caused by global cooling?(1)  See, e.g., Nicholas Stern, ""Bali: Now the Rich Must Pay,"" The Guardian, Nov. 30, 2007.(2)  Jessica Gresko, ""U.S. is Virtually Unscathed by Hurricanes in 2007,"" Associated Press, November 27, 2007."	1.0	It blows	2007-12-26	51	28	23

And although the perspective which the common citizen respect the science has experienced notables changes in the last six decades, the disillusion, hopeless and fear possibly have not been more dramatic than at this historical moment.But the warnings sent by the nature, simply are ignorant of any sort of agreement; the mankind has surpassed the ethical boundaries and the environment simply has reacted according the well known principle of action and reaction established by Newton.It' s time to realize we cannot shirk our moral and ethical responsibilities and beyond all the coziness the technology has provided us, there has been an usurpation of permissible limits that mirror a distorted conception respect the limits of our own growth. Moreover, the core of this global issue doesn't fall back over us as citizens, and admit there has been a considerable of silent scientists who have foreseen what' s going on and nevertheless, have decided to make silence due to unconceivable reasons. The possession of knowledge carries a moral obligation.So what we will watch in this dramatic movie is just the iceberg' s point  of considerable magnitude that is challenging with threatening celerity. The derived consequences o this misconception of the progress will work out (as it actually is happening) as a sinister boomerang that attacks without any sort of consideration or geopolitical zones. A typhoon, a tornado, a sudden increase of the pluviometric level or its correspondent drought due the gradual displacement of the normal distribution of rains, are undeniable facts and the enormous number of causes such as the visible increase in the levels of CO2 , the overpopulation and the countless catalogue of crucial and incidental factors that fall into the actual state of things demands from us, effective solutions.But the billion dollars question stands out is: Will enough politics will exist and necessary universal agreement to face this huge challenge even if it implies the required confiscation of certain human rights and inherent legal restrictions concerned with the individuals liberties, contained into the same entrails of the democracy ?Because when the mankind's surviving is in that irreversible point of no return, perhaps we will have to derogate and overlook certain formal and real liberties in order to achieve that superior aim.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A26DQJOPIDYCTL	H S Marks	"Feel compelled to share the following with you as the hype behind this movie and the idolisation of Gore at Sundance and in the media misses something very relevant that is evaded in this film...the Gore/Clintonrecord on climate change.By MITCHEL COHENAl Gore's film, ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" raises the issue of global warming in a way that scares the bejeezus out of viewers, as it should since the consequences of global climate change are truly earth-shaking. The former Vice-President does a good job of presenting the graphic evidence, exquisite and terrifying pictures that document the melting of the polar ice caps and the effects on other species, new diseases, and rising ocean levels.But, typically, the solutions Gore offers are standard Democratic Party fare. You'd never know by watching this film that Gore and Clinton ran this country for 8 years and that their policies -- as much as those of the Bush regime -- helped pave the way for the crisis we face today.Gore never critiques the system causing the global ecological crisis. At one point, he even mourns the negative impact of global warming on U.S. oil pipelines. Oh, the horror! What it all comes down to, for Gore and the Democrats, is that we need to shift away from reliance on fossil fuels and tweak existing consumption patterns.Even there, Gore and Clinton did nothing to improve fuel efficiency in the U.S. -- a topic which Gore talks about in the movie without any hint that he'd once actually been in a position to do something about it. The question Gore poses is, Who can best manage the relatively minor solutions he recommends, the Democrats or Republicans? For Gore, it's sort of ""trust US, not THEM, to deal with this situation because they are liars and we're not."" Well, should we trust him?As Joshua Frank writes, during the campaign for president in 1992 Gore promised a group of supporters that the Clinton-Gore EPA would never approve a hazardous waste incinerator located near an elementary school in Liverpool, Ohio, which was operated by WTI. ""Only three months into Clinton's tenure,"" Frank writes, ""the EPA issued an operating permit for the toxic burner. Gore raised no qualms. Not surprisingly, most of the money behind WTI came from the bulging pockets of Jackson Stephens, who just happened to be one of the Clinton-Gore's top campaign contributors.""(1)But failing to shut down toxic incinerators is just the tip of their great betrayal. In the film, Gore references the Kyoto Accords and states that he personally went to Kyoto during the negotiations, giving the impression that he was a key figure in fighting to reduce air pollution emissions that destroy the ozone layer. What he omits is that his mission in going to Kyoto was to scuttle the Accords, to block them from moving forward. And he succeeded.The Clinton-Gore years were anything but environment-friendly. Under Clinton-Gore, more old growth forests were cut down than under any other recent U.S. administration. ""Wise Use"" committees -- set up by the lumber industry -- were permitted to clearcut whole mountain ranges, while Clinton-Gore helped to ""greenwash"" their activities for public consumption.Under Clinton-Gore, the biotech industry was given carte blanche to write the US government's regulations (paltry as they are) on genetic engineering of agriculture, and to move full speed ahead with implementing the private patenting of genetic sequences with nary a qualm passing Gore's lips.You'd think watching this film that Gore is just some concerned professor who never had access to power or held hundreds of thousands of dollars of stock in Occidental Petroleum (driving the U'wa off their lands in Colombia), let alone was the Number Two man actually running the U.S. government!""Gore, like Clinton who quipped that 'the invisible hand has a green thumb,' extolled a free-market attitude toward environmental issues,"" writes Frank, who goes on to quote Jeffrey St. Clair: ""Since the mid-1980s Gore has argued with increasing stridency that the bracing forces of market capitalism are potent curatives for the ecological entropy now bearing down on the global environment. He is a passionate disciple of the gospel of efficiency, suffused with an inchoate technophilia.""(2)Before Kyoto, before the Clinton-Gore massive depleted uranium bombings of Yugoslavia and Iraq, before their missile ""deconstruction"" of the only existing pharmaceutical production facility in northern Africa in the Sudan (which exacerbated the very serious problems there, as we're seeing in Darfur today), there was NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. The task of Clinton-Gore was to push through this legislation which not even strong Republican administrations under Reagan or Bush Sr. had been able to do. Since its inception, NAFTA has undermined U.S. environmental laws, chased production facilities out of the U.S. and across the borders, vastly increased pollution from Maquilladoras (enterprise zones) along the U.S./Mexico border and helped to undermine the indigenous sustainable agrarian-based communities in southern Mexico -- as predicted by leftists in both countries, leading to the Zapatista uprising from those communities on January 1, 1994, the day NAFTA went into effect.Clinton-Gore also approved the destructive deal with the sugar barons of South Florida arranged by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, which doomed the Everglades. (In fact, Clinton was on the phone with Alfonso Fanjul, Jr., the chief of the sugar barons, while Monica Lewinsky was busy doing her thing in her famous blue dress under Clinton's desk.)Early in Clinton-Gore's first administration, they pledged they would stop the plunder of the Northwest forests, writes former Village Voice columnist James Ridgeway. ""They then double-crossed their environmental backers. Under Bush Sr., the courts had enjoined logging in the Northwest habitats of the spotted owl. Clinton-Gore persuaded environmentalists to join them in axing the injunction. The Clinton administration went before a Reagan-appointed judge who had a record as a stalwart environmentalist and with the eco toadies in tow, got him to remove the injunction, and with it the moratorium on existing timber sales.""(3)Then Gore and Clinton ""capitulated to the demands of Western Democrats and yanked from its initial budget proposals a call to reform grazing, mining, and timber practices on federal lands. When Clinton convened a timber summit in Portland, Oregon, in April 1994, the conference was, as one might expect, dominated by logging interests. Predictably, the summit gave way to a plan to restart clear-cutting in the ancient forests of the Pacific Northwest for the first time in three years, giving the timber industry its get rich wish.""(4)Gore and Clinton sent to Congress the infamous Salvage Rider, known to radical environmentalists as the ""Logging without Laws"" bill, ""perhaps the most gruesome legislation ever enacted under the pretext of preserving ecosystem health."" Like Bush's ""Healthy Forests"" plan, the Clinton-Gore act ""was chock full of deception and special interest pandering. 'When [the Salvage Rider] bill was given to me, I was told that the timber industry was circulating this language among the Northwest Congressional delegation and others to try to get it attached as a rider to the fiscal year Interior Spending Bill,' environmental lawyer Kevin Kirchner says. 'There is no question that representatives of the timber industry had a role in promoting this rider. That is no secret.'""(5) What the Salvage Rider did was to ""temporarily exempt ... salvage timber sales on federal forest lands from environmental and wildlife laws, administrative appeals, and judicial review,"" according to the Wilderness Society -- long enough for multinational lumber and paper corporations to clear-cut all but a sliver of the U.S.'s remaining old growth forests.""Thousands of acres of healthy forestland across the West were rampaged. Washington's Colville National Forest saw the clear cutting of over 4,000 acres. Thousands more in Montana's Yak River Basin, hundreds of acres of pristine forest land in Idaho, while the endangered Mexican Spotted Owl habitat in Arizona fell victim to corporate interests. Old growth trees in Washington's majestic Olympic Peninsula -- home to wild Steelhead, endangered Sockeye salmon, and threatened Marbled Murrieta -- were chopped with unremitting provocation by the US Forest Service.""(6)The assault on nature continued with Gore's blessing.Around the same time, Clinton-Gore appointee Carol Browner, head of the EPA, was quoted in the NY Times as having said that the administration would be ""relaxing"" the Delaney Clause (named after its author, Congressman James Delaney, D-NY). Congress had inserted this clause into section 409 of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in 1958. It prohibited FDA approval of any food additive found to cause cancer in humans or animals. Alone among all food-related directives, this legislation put the onus on the manufacturers to demonstrate that their products were safe before they were allowed to become commercially available. (7) A federal appeals court in July 1992 expanded the jurisdiction of the Delaney Clause, ruling that it was applicable to cancer-causing pesticides in processed food. Browner retracted her comment, claiming she'd never said it, but the proof was in the pudding. The ban on cancer-causing additives (the ""Precautionary Principle"") that had held through the Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush, Sr. administrations was finally removed, not by the Republicans but by the Clinton-Gore administration. Instead of expanding the Delaney clause to protect produce and other unprocessed foods, the new Food Quality Protection Act legislation permitted ""safe"" amounts of carcinogenic chemicals (as designated by the Environmental Protection Agency) to be added to all food. (According to Peter Montague, editor of Rachel's Weekly, ""no one knows how 'safe amounts' of carcinogens can be established, especially when several carcinogens and other poisons are added simultaneously to the food of tens of millions of people.) Nevertheless, the Clinton-Gore administration spun this as ""progress.""The Clinton administration, with guidance from Gore's office, also cut numerous deals over the pesticide Methyl Bromide despite its reported effects of contributing to Ozone depletion and its devastating health consequences on farm workers picking strawberries.Much is being made these days about the need to save the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. But Clinton-Gore opened the National Petroleum Reserve "" 24 million untouched acres adjacent to the refuge, home to a large caribou herd and numerous arctic species "" to oil drilling. The chief beneficiaary of this was Arco, a major ($1.4 million) contributor to the Democratic Party. At the same time, writes James Ridgeway, ""Clinton dropped the ban on selling Alaskan oil abroad. This also benefits Arco, which is opening refineries in China. So although the oil companies won the right to exploit Alaskan oil on grounds that to do so would benefit national development, Clinton-Gore unilaterally changed the agreement so that it benefits China's industrial growth.""(8)Not once in the entire film does Gore criticize this awful environmental record or raise the critical questions we need to answer if we are to effectively reverse global warming: Is it really the case that the vast destruction of our environment that went on under his watch and, continuing today, is simply a result of poor consumer choices and ineffective government policies? Is the global environmental devastation we are facing today rectifiable with some simple tuning-up, as Gore proposes?Neither he -- as point man for the Clinton administration on environmental issues -- nor Clinton-Gore's Energy Secretary Bill Richardson (with major ties to Occidental Petroleum), nor the Democratic Party in general offer anything more than putting a tiny Band-Aid on the earth's gaping wounds, which they themselves helped to gash open.Clearly, the vast destruction of the global ecology is a consequence not just of poor governmental policies but of the capitalist system's fundamental drive towards Growth and what passes for Development -- Grow or Die. Environmental activists won't find in Gore the kind of systemic analysis that is needed to stop global warming. Instead, we need to look elsewhere for that sort of deep systemic critique."	3.0	As a warning it does its job...BUT !!!	2007-02-10	25	8	17

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2BVCT2MPS6LHI	Huge Viking	"Al Gore is at it again with his liberal environmentalist whacko issues of the so-called global warming. We cannot say it's the truth, and it should only be based on theory. Global warming is only used by liberals as a scare tactic. Al Gore spent too much time growing up as a city slicker in Washington when his segregationalist daddy, Al Sr, was in the Senate. Gore only relies on data released by these so-called environmentalists.If you really want to know better about the environment, it is not CO2 emissions that causes global warming. While CO2 is the heaviest gas in our atmosphere, all human and animal life exhale CO2 which is a beneficial gas that vegetation thrives on such as trees and plants that take in the CO2 and convert it back to oxygen. Also, the ""warming"" we are experiencing is due to the fact that climate changes occur in cycles. There have been record highs over one hundred years ago as well as record lows in between. The last few winters we've experienced were at record lows, particularly in upstate New York where temperatures dipped down to a fridgid -35F. Now what does that explain? In any part of the world climate does not remain stable where one would experience the same temperatures over and over again at a certain time of year since there are changes occurring all the time, it alternates.Volcanic eruptions would be a very big problem since a single volcano can release nearly ten times more toxic gases than all manmade emissions throughout the world combined. Third world nations account for environmental problems where there are virtually no strict codes on hazardous waste disposal. Hence, disease is rampant in these nations that have very few or no sanitation facilities by dumping solid waste directly into drinking water or into the ocean where deep water coral reefs thrive. Yes, there are deep water reefs in many parts of the world that encapsulate CO2 and other gases. Pollutants dumped into the sea are killing these reefs, thus releasing these gases into the atmosphere.True environmentalists are usually those employed by the logging industry that have done intense studies, maintaining nurseries, and replacing each hewned tree with two to four saplings.

Why couldn't we have had Gore as President instead of this thug in office?I was very impressed with Gore's passion for waking us up to the obvious, our planet could be forced into another ice age very quickly if we don't get our act together.  We can, but we won't.  Big money and fast greed and consumption are the reality.  I remember that old Twilight Zone episode where the sun is so hot and everything melts even a painting.

If you are undecided or believe that Global Warming is in fact real, then it is your duty to watch Inconvenient Truth produced by Al Gore.  If, on the other hand, you believe that Global Warming is a propaganda tool used by the left to scare people then pass on this movie.  I belong to the former section of people.This documentary/film attempts to inform the viewer of the changes in climate being experienced around the Globe.  Al Gore shows actual footage of icebergs melting and animals struggling to survive in their changing environment.  The only reason why I didn't rate this film 5 stars is because I didn't like the fact that solutions weren't really provided.  For example, we are told to minimize our impact on the environment but not really told how, other than generic ways (e.g. save gas, turn the water off while you brush, etc.).  I hope that Al Gore makes another film on the subject, but this time with a focus on what the individual can do to help solve the problem.Overall, I recommend this movie that either believes that Global Warming is real or is otherwise undecided.	4.0	Is Global Warming Real?	2007-12-23	4	1	3

Earth will not heal itself over night we have to take part in that.  I know many scientists agree that the Earth goes through cycles of changes over the course of thousands of years but this movie shows that it is happening so much faster than we thought.

Except for a few simplifications, Gore's work--and that of the scientists whom he cites--is scientifically sound.  And, of course, you can check on it yourself too.  Read the scientists themselves (and don't trust those who quote the scientists, by the way, because, as Crichton does, writers may cherry-pick their figures and quote without context.)Beyond this issue, the movie even manages to entertain, to be movING.  It's sad to read the one star reviews here that posit debunked alternatives and make political and personal attacks.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A19JYLHD94K94D	Itamar Katz	A brief explanation - I did not intend to go see this movie, I was waiting for it to hit the video stores. Michael Moore's last two releases being an exception, I rarely buy tickets to see documentaries. In fact, I was going to see Superman Returns, in IMAX. The film started out fine, but thanks to the dreadful heat wave that hit New York last week, the air conditioning was turned up as high as it could go in the huge theatre, and five minutes into Superman the power went out. I received tickets to go to any movie that I wanted, and the only thing that was on was this - Al Gore's film about Global Warming. The simple truth of it is, if it wasn't for the effects of Global Warming, I never would have gone and seen this film. Do you think Mr. Gore would have appreciated the irony?Hats off to Mr. Gore. Gore did not, like so many other failed presidential candidates, let himself be tossed into the trash can of politics; and rather than being content with entering the history books as The Man Who Was Almost President - and let's face it, his loss was particularly painful and controversial as elections go - he found an agenda that is close to his heart and pursues it with all his might. Despite what some Bush-ists might tell you, this is not a Gore propaganda movie; the 2000 elections are referred to very briefly, and he does not linger on it. Instead, he precisely and strongly makes his point. And a good point it is.An Inconvenient Truth is a wake up call, and it draws attention to a subject that is not generally given remotely enough attention. The United States all too often pokes its nose so deeply into the problems of the whole world, it fails to see the problems at home; the statistics that Gore reveals are staggering and worrying, and it's time somebody took the issue seriously. Is the film biased, are the statistics at times treated in a less than objective manner? Does Gore use at times emotional manipulation to help make himself heard? The answers to these questions are yes. And if that's what it takes, I'm all for it. You might also argue that Gore gives the viewers very little practical advice of what they can actually do to solve the problem. That's true. The sad truth is, an individual can do very little to actually change this frightening reality. But if with this film Gore succeeds, little by little, to raise awareness to the problem and to make just a few more people care and think about it, then little by little it will get better. Eventually, maybe enough people will care that someone in a position of power takes notice, too. If that happens, the film did its job.An Inconvenient Truth is hardly fun, but I honestly think everyone should watch it. Take no heed of the closed-minded people who say that Gore is dull, charmless or pretentious; he is in fact a highly skilled speaker, incredibly intelligent, with bags of charisma, and also, you'll be amazed, a great sense of humor. I had only two regrets while watching the film: one was that I could not ask Gore any questions - his speech drew me in so deeply. The second was that this man did not become president. I have a hunch we'd all have been better off.	5.0	Hats off to Al Gore	2006-08-06	19	10	9

I am sure this will touch people in many different ways, especially those in politics bent on trying to lie about the truths that are so evident in our world today.

That doesn't mean I don't care: I recycle!  However, Al Gore and the makers of the film did a real favor for the cause of stopping global warming.  I often find it difficult to believe any person who is so focused on any single issue.  Single-issue devotees will often believe anything at face-value that supports their cause, and likewise dismiss those points that are contrary to their cause.  And they'll do both of those things regardless of the evidence behind the information.  Sometimes the global warming folks are just plain off.  When I was young - too darned long ago! - I remember teachers telling me that by 2000 NYC would be like Florida.  As a kid growing up in Jersey, you can imagine my disappointment that such a change did not occur.  (I stood on the corner with my Mickey ears on every day waiting!)  Still, if even a quarter of what Gore says is true, then more needs to be done to address pretty convincing evidence that the planet is heating up.  Like the make clear in the film, making the necessary changes requires some dedication, but not some radical readjustments in lifestyles.  Furthermore, the changes may actually HELP our economy.  Unfortunately for Americans, long term economic planning is not a strong point, but maybe we can package it in a way that will sell.  I'm thinking some tie-in with Jackass or something like that."	5.0	Distubingly awesome film	2007-01-11	0	0	0

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3LYSACWWL02LN	JackP	It breaks it down for the unaware and those who have been brainwashed. But it does nothing for the Bush and Limbaugh lovers who will beleive the 1% of 'experts' who probably got their degree [...] It's hilarious how the these 1%'experts' are cited over and over again when none of their 'expert' research has ever been published in a serious scientific journal or review. They keep spewing out crap, hoping no one will call them on it.For example, someone posted earlier about how our volcanoes spew out more CO2 than all of our cars combined. Yea ok, I think this person spew out more bs than volcanoes. If he 'checked' the facts, which takes like 3 seconds, instead of swallowing everything Limbaugh tells him, he would've soon figured out that man made CO2 per year is more than 150 times that of volcanoes. And that was by 1991 estimate. Today it is at least 10 times that. 2006 and 2005 has the highest ever recorded CO2 level in over hundreds of thousands of years. These findings are done NOT by GORE, (and who really cares who is doing the talking if it is TRUE??)but by dedicated scientists who teach at major universities and publish reports in scietinfic journals - it's like the medical journal for doctors. These journals are highly technical, thourough researched and vetted, the findings MUST be verifiable and it must pass the scrutiny of professional peers in the field. Our country has the best universities in the world and there is a REASON for that. Out of thousands of scientific papers written on the subject by top research universitie on global warming, NONE, ZERO disagree with the disastrous effects of man made CO2 on global warming.Yet these ignorant people, thinking they are 'smarter' than scientists with PhDs, dismiss them with such casual air, as if that's the only way they can make themselves stand out or be more important than them. God, how low people would go for their egos.They rather listen to 'expert' idiots like themselves who often work for Mobile & Exxon, who knows nothing about the real science and will say anything for $$$$, they are the true science fiction writers, like the guy that wrote Jurasaic Park. The only 'fact' they bother to read are those books next to National Enquirer. They wouldn't understand the first paragraph of a real scientific paper if their live depended on it.And another said something about 'global tax'. Huh? What the heck do you think we are paying for now in Iraq. We are securing ME oil to make the big oil companies in business. Every American and their daughters and sons will be paying trillions and trillions for this war. How could someone be worried about paying $8 for a DOCUMENTARY (and when was the last time an anti-global warming documentary was free?)and not worry how much he/she is paying for oil?? We are literally paying thousands of dollars in hidden tax for this war. And the only ones to benefit are the rich oil companies and the subcontractors. All awhile making our climate worse. They don't spend hundreds of millions of dollar for nothing. That's where these idiot scientists with their bs findings come from. If cigarette companies, with a fraction of money of oil companies, can still convince people smoking does NOT cause cancer, what do you think oil companies are capable of??????I'm so glad Americans are waking up, after being raped by the greedy sycophants of this country.	5.0	A very important documentary	2006-11-04	26	18	8

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	I will not discuss the details, particularly the scientific details and methods. There are a few things that are not entirely acceptable. For one and only instance he manipulates facts when he pretends no scientific voice has spoken in doubt of the global warming theory. Richard Lindzen who is an important climatologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has widely and wildly spoken against it. But he is true on one fact. There is no reason to do something that could be harmful in a way or another and that we can avoid. Going against pollution and carbon mono- and dioxide emission is ethically good because there is no reason why we should pollute and emit carbon mono- and dioxides unnecessarily. This is also economically wise because there is no reason why we should produce waste since then waste-processing is an economic cost that will cripple the economy in a very short period of time. He is also right on another thing. It is a political issue and it has to be dealt with as such. But the film is not even a documentary. It lacks several elements to be one. For one it does not provide an opportunity to anyone to speak: it is a monologue. For two it does not provide an opportunity to anyone to dissent with the only point of view that is defended here. In other words it is perfect propaganda, advertising, and nothing else. Even worse, the term of truth is irritating to the utmost. We are not looking for truth because truth does not exist. There are only points of view. So we have to convince people and to do so we have to be balanced and listen to other points of view and not to impose one point of view by unilaterally calling it truth. And anyway when that truth becomes A truth that means there are more than one, but then they are not truth, they are points of view. The same remark goes for the direct quotation of the Book of Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse. Any apocalyptic vision is to be rejected if we want to work on the reason of people and not on their fear. Any ethical decision is ethical only if it is based on conviction and not on fear. Al Gore, in a nice tone, with a cool intonation, spreads fear with even some symbolical elements like the Twin Towers Memorial being underwater if his apocalyptic prediction turns true. At least that is what Milton taught me three centuries ago. Even worse again. How dare he quote Winston Churchill speaking of Hitler and Nazism to speak of climate change and the apocalypse he is announcing? That is gross, un-respectful of the people who fought against Hitler who was not a simple tornado and was slightly more systematic in his apocalyptic bulldozing of the world than a hurricane would be. Bad taste indeed. His knowledge of history is also particularly warped. He attributes all positive elements to the US, including the French Revolution - who was a great blood bath by the way - but he forgets to attribute the two atomic mushrooms that ever exploded over a city to the United States in violation of the Yalta agreement: then he becomes general and the fault is nicely laid down on the threshold of humanity in general. It is also by far too personal, nearly a life story, and definitely the political allusions about recent presidential elections and other events are out of place in a documentary on climate change, and it destroys some more the ambition of this film to be a documentary. But it sure will lead to constant and wide debates on the question of global warming.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines	4.0	Polemical personal approach presented as THE truth	2007-10-08	9	2	7

He lays his soul bare to warn us of the consequences of our inaction now regarding this crisis, because it relays to the events in his own life in the past that brought him to this point as well.The scenes showing his early years in Congress, his son's car accident, the 2000 election (yes, I cried here,) and the very poignant scenes of him with his sister Nancy who died of lung cancer revealed to me a man not doing this out of any selfish political intent, but of a man who is telling you, the viewer, that even he has had to experience loss and near loss in his life in order to realize what he lost and how much of a part he played in it. I think those scenes were shown in direct correlation to this climate crisis and his message that we must not make the same mistake now with our planet.Will we look back years from now regretting that we continued the very behavior that is contributing to this crisis even knowing what it is doing to our planet? Or will we take the necessary steps to change our ways and heed the warnings before it is too late? That is the question of this movie and there is no alarmism whatsoever in the presentation of the solutions we have at our disposal. Mr. Gore relays the facts starkly, calmly, and at times humorously, and clearly lays out what we can do to mitigate this crisis. And the scientific consensus cannot be denied that we as a species are contributing to it and it is having a definite effect on our world.His statistics on Co2, invasive species, species loss, ice cap melting, population growth, etc., intertwined with footage from around the world showing the effects of the statistics he showed was all very well presented and backed up. I also never got the impression that any of this is about him in any other sense than him using himself as an example of someone who had to reach the bottom in order to reach for the top.I laughed, I cried, and I saw before me on the screen a man who has surely come full circle with who he is and what his mission is, and that is handing that mission and truth to us. He says he is not a hero, and frankly, I didn't see a hero in this movie and that is a good thing. Heroes have a tendency to be placed on pedestals and forgotten. I saw something much more. I saw a prophet, a missive, and a trailblazer who has full faith in our abilty to save our planet. And we must not let our planet down, and that also includes those in government and the corporate world whose indifference to this issue can no longer be tolerated.This is a movie that will make you see the world in a whole new light. And you must see it. And you must make sure those you love see it, especially your children. My teenage son watched this movie with me, and after it I asked what he learned from it. He said it told him that it was time to wake up and do something. I say, amen to that.So thank you Al Gore, Davis Guggenheim, Laurie David, Lawrence Bender, Jeff Skoll, Paramount Classics, and Participant Productions for giving us this journey to now guide us on the greatest challenge we will ever face. And we will face it, because we must. And whether you even like Al Gore or not is not the point, for this in no way is a partisan political movie. The point is that this world belongs to all of us, and unless we learn to see the slow boil we will surely reap the consequences. It truly is a moral issue. So do I recommend this movie? Yes, with every fiber of my being, and as the credits rolled, I noticed that there was not the usual rush to get out of the theatre. People continued to sit watching the credits and listening to Melissa Etheridge sing...then it went quiet. That was when I stood up and clapped exclaiming, 'Thank you, Al Gore!'... and the entire theatre then clapped with me, and it felt good, for I too had waited a long time to be able to show this man the depth of the gratitude I have for him. Now it is up to us to continue to spread his inspirational and crucial message where it left off in the theatre. May we have the strength and will to do so.	5.0	Al Gore's Journey Is Now Ours	2006-10-24	29	20	9

Bailor ""Toxic Vomit"""	"This Inconvenient Lie by the paid shill Al Gore used computerized material from the movie ""The Day After Tomorrow"" as some proof of what was attempting to be pushed. It is common knowledge by now that Gore's shockumentary has been completely disproven. The ""hockey-stick"" graph was forced to be removed due to the manipulation that created it. It was found that the rise in temperature is then FOLLOWED by the rise in CO2, not the other way around. The IPCC has been caught in numerous lies and data manipulation, and is now being told to stop reporting on Climate Change. Anthropogenic Global Warming has been completely disproven and only misinformed conditioned idiots still believe in it. The planet has actually been cooling since the late 90's......but it will begin to rise, and then cool, and then rise, and then cool, etc. - just as it always has. The earth, sun, and surrounding planets all go through cycles - they always have and always will. When the earth was warming and blamed on AGW, so were the surrounding planets.....I suppose the same temperature increases on Mars must have been due to SUV's and corporate pollution too!This all for the purpose of restricting what humans can do while implementing a Carbon Tax (futher robbery) and a Global Tax. Carbon is necessary for plants to breath, in turn producing oxygen so we can breath. Restriction, profit, and eugenics are the aim here. Gore was being sued by 30,000 scientists and climatologists for this, but I am sure most have not seen any of this on the owned corporate media propaganda.I am all for reduction of polluting and the way we treat the earth, but I am not falling for this propaganda!

The film uses dramatic film footage, and false data to mislead us into thinking that the amount of carbon we produce is heating up the planet.  Yes, the carbon and other pollutions we release into the air and water are bad for us and in many ways are killing us.  But heating up the planet, NO!!! The only thing that heats up this planet, as it  also heats up the other planets, is the SUN! We are going threw a cycle, as this plant has done millions upon millions of times before.

I know there are some of you out there saying ""Oh, the planet will reset itself, we can't do anything, it's what god intended"".  All that may be true, but you're all a bunch of lazy cowards for saying so.  Is this a gamble we're really ready to make?  Are you realy that trust worthy of your politicians that've done nothing but lie to you thus far, that you're willing to just sit back and hope they're right?  I'm sure you'll all be saying that same thing when you're watching your family drown.  When you're displaced because your home and everything you've ever known is washed away.  You think ther world is over populated now, how about if there were 30% less land mass in the world, what then?  You sure sound cool saying that now though, so go with it & keep lying to yourself & others, ignorance is bliss I guess.  We're teetering on the end of the world here people, we have evil men in power running amok & unchecked, bullying around the entire world.  These mad men think the pusuit of the last drop of oil so they can line their wallets is more important than anything else; can't you all see that?

This isn't a political issue, this effects every man, woman, & child on the planet, and leaving it up to the politicians isn't gonna be good enough any more.  We all need to take a stand and stop this while we still can.  Maybe we can't, maybe we're to far gone & won't be able to have any lasting effects, but shouldn't we at least try?  Don't we at least owe that to our beloved mother earth?  After all the holes, craters & spills and everything else we've done here don't we at least owe that?

Based on the majority of reviewers here, other people got the message, there it seems that retired electrical engineer Eugene Keech is hell bent on disproving it all. The movie doesn't go that in depth into the Kyoto treaty or its provisions. It does however tell an extremely compelling story of our planet's history (to the tune of 650,000 years and 7 ice ages) and it projected future. How can one not see the pattern, see the exponential curve and still not believe that all Gore is doing is speaking on behalf of the scientific community.Edit: Yes the huge chart that Al shows looks like it fits together ... that is until one discovers that there is an 800 year lag between higher CO2 and temperature. I feel misled by this. See the Google video here:[...]According to the data Gore presented it won't be 2100 when the S**T hits the fan but 2050 or less. Is it so hard to believe? Environmental changes are obvious, I found the break up of the Antarctic ice shelves particularly disturbing. but the crux of the matter is, are humans causing the climate changes? I no longer believe we are/do.Will the economy crash if more fuel efficient cars are produced. Hmmmm, let's ask Toyota and Honda what kind of year they had. See the movie, share the movie, join the virtual march, buy some compact fluorescents (buy them at a club store to get them at less than $2 a bulb), do recycle, do lower your thermostat in the winter and raise it in the summer.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"""An Inconvenient Truth"" is Al Gore's desperate attempt to awaken the American people and the world to the threat of global warming. The film mostly follows Gore's global warming slideshow to a single audience, but also shows him giving versions of the presentation to groups in other locales. Gore is wistful, funny, smart and pointed. But considering the heartbreak of his 2000 presidential bid, he is never cruel or vindictive. Gore is the rare politician who is correct in his views, forceful and persuasive in his opinions, and almost entirely dismissed by the public at large. That he nevertheless keeps pressing on is a testament to his character.Gore's slideshow not only lays out the overwhelming evidence for global warming, but it answers the critic's objections and provides ways that each of us can reduce carbon emissions as well. Using carbon dioxide and temperature data (from Antarctic ice samples going back 650,000 years) Gore convincingly demonstrates that the recent rise in global temperate is not part of a natural cycle. Though the film does not overtly tilt against the current administration, it does paint a bleak picture of its policies. Gore's litany of Bush's ecological sins is well known and includes congressional claims that global warming is as myth, political rewriting of scientific papers, pressuring NASA to harass global warming proponents, abandonment of the Kyoto protocols and a lack of interest in hiking automobile gasoline mileage.""An Inconvenient Truth"" is not a political film; Gore is not using it as a springboard for political office. It is based in solid science and a passionate love for the natural world. The film should bolster the spirits of those who view the mounting evidence of global catastrophe (and our government's lack of response) with growing dismay. It should also keep awake anyone honest enough to think about the facts Gore lays out in this very important film."	5.0	Gore in a landslide	2006-07-30	29	21	8

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A321WUIRSPNM6N	Jeff J.	I've been skeptical in recent years over the idea of global warming.  There's evidence -- and Gore showed it in his film -- that the Earth has been through warmer, more tropical periods than the one in which we now live.  It's also been through cooler periods.  I'm not an environmental scientist, but I know enough about statistics, correlations, and so forth (I do have a Ph.D. in the social sciences) that I can see that this phenomenon is for real.  The Tim C.s and E. Keech's out there are who bash this film do so out of partisan spite without offering a shread of real scientific evidence to back their counterclaims.  People like you two need to either put up or shut up.  This isn't a partisan issue.  This is not even an American issue.  It's a human issue, and it's time to act, now, before the human race has to put itself on the endangered species list.Gore may have said or done some really dumb things in the past, like his 'inventing the Internet' remark or the way he generally handled his 2000 campaign for the White House, but then who doesn't make mistakes?  He's right on target with this documentary.  He's done his homework.  His information is based on well-conducted, documented research.  He's credible, in a nut-shell.  This is no mistake here.  This problem is real, and as the film says, it's An Inconvenient Truth.  It's time to act before Earth becoms an inconvenient place to live.	5.0	Global warming is for real, people.	2007-01-14	9	6	3

Another fact to put in perspective is the production costs of a hybrid vehicle burn more pollutants than the average 70's gas hog would in a lifetime.This movie is just political crud.	1.0	An Unbelievable Lie	2006-12-23	62	13	49
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y	Jeffrey A. Thompson	Al Gore has a very good message and it needs to be heard. He presents it in a powerful way. However, Al has one big problem his ego and an ax to grind. He never knows when to stop. To his credit, he does a decent job of toning down the politics, but he disparages replubicans exclusively. Excuse me, there was the Clinton/Gore whitehouse for 8 years between the Bush's, but nary a word about that presidency. The present administration deserves a lot of heat, but this is a bigger problem than what Bush created. I agree Man is exacerbating global warming, but the whole look at the life of Al Gore and the sacrifices he makes for this cause, slow the movie down immeasureably. I mean if he was likeable, he would have pounded G. W. in the election.Another problem, he perpetuates every myth about global warming and does not give the whole story. I know Crichton has took Gore to task for some of the facts presented before this movie was even made. Gore quoted a paper that there is total agreement by almost all scientists on global warming. Crichton pointed out that this research on the research can not be duplicated. It would be extremely surprising that there would be total agreement. The diversity of opinion it what makes research work. Do not get me wrong, the movie does present evidence Man's contribution to global warming in a very convincing manner, but Gore does not present a balance view. Another example, the frog in the boiling water myth. Never happens. The frog jumps out when he gets hot. I am being picky, but it proves my point. This is message that needs to be preached, but don't expect impartiality from this movie or perfect research.In summary, this movie makes excellent points about the dangers we face and they need to be addressed. It does it in a entertaining and powerful  way. Gore is to be commended for his work. Unfortunately, the hero worship of Gore in this movie detracts from the message.	4.0	I agree, but ...	2007-02-04	14	7	7

Al Gore makes his points clear and easy to understand for anyone. This should be mandatory viewing for everyone - especially in our government for those politicians driven by donations and favors from special interest groups. We need to realize that we need to do something now - we only have this one Earth, there will be no second chance and no quick fix. We all need to change our mind set regarding energy consumption, recycling and environmental protection. In the United States we get lazier and more wasteful each day, and we need to put a stop to that or our future generations will not survive.

He offers anecdotal evidence aplenty that the world is warming-- but it's not proof.  He offers no compelling evidence that CO2 is causing this warming and, in fact, the only evidence he DOES offer on that shows exactly the opposite-- that global warming causes CO2.  Finally, he offers no evidence at all that humans are creating the CO2 increase in an amount equal to the problem.  Finally, he says that we only have ten years to save the planet.  Considering he started saying that nine years ago, I think we should just ignore him and try to live with it.  We're doing pretty well so far.	1.0	What truth?	2007-07-20	31	10	21

An inconvenient truth is a documentary that has Al gore spoon feeding you ""facts"" for over an hour.  The problem is that he has no credible sources in his list of experts at the end of the credits.  Not one of the scientist he states specialize in the climate change and geography.  Instead they specialize in chemistry and biology. It's as if Al gore is saying anything he wants and claimming these facts are cold hard evidence without proof!!!!! According to Mr. Gore there is no hope, and the world will become destroyed by rising sea levels.  How can the so many people believe Al Gores Pseudo-political garbage. Just because Al Gore said so, doesn't mean it is so.  I find it pathetic how everyone takes his claims so seriously.  Global warming is a natural occurence, and the main cause of C02 emmisions is not people!!!!  The main cause are volcanoes!!!!!  Infact we constitute a mere fraction perhaps under 1% of the worlds C02 emissions.  I'm not saying were not to blame here because we are. However, we are just speeding up an inevitable process that has occured throughout history.  Global warming will not destroy the world as Mr. Gore has said it is a natural process that we will be able to adapt to.  The world will not become submerged in a day or two people!!! It will take decades, and we will adapt accordingly.  We cannot stop this process even if we tried.  So please save yourself from Mr. Gore's unproven hocus pocus garbage.  Mr. Gore only wants to brainwash you into feeling insecure because he was a failure in politics.  Beause he was a failure he feels he must push the only thing he has left onto us.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A258O0KFLNZBSC	Jigen	"A couple of reviews here (doubtless from folk who haven't seen the film) make some embarassing errors. First off, Al Gore didn't invent the internet. Nor did he claim to, although he did help the flow of funding for it. Secondly, if climate change is just a hoax or a conspiracy - why? Who profits from such a hoax or conspiracy? No answer for that one, eh? Now we've gotten rid of the straw men, let's look at the facts.The facts are in this film. They are startling, eye-opening and depressing. Our population is growing rapidly, our use of natural resources is growing rapidly, the decline of or environment is happenind rapidly, and Mr Gore is trying to wake us up to these simple facts. We are mere custodians of this wonderful planet, and as such we are doing a lousy job. The short term gains (wealth, material possessions) are causing us to borrow heavily, too heavily, from future generations. Mr Gore doesn't provide any easy answers for a way out; his goal for now is to open our eyes and minds. This film does an admirable job and makes a compelling case. He shows that you can shift your position from that of part of the problem to part of the solution, a parallel he draws with his family tobacco farm - they didn't want to believe their product caused cancer but when they saw the facts they changed their ways. It takes a big man to admit he's wrong.Those who've made their mind up (that it's a hoax) won't change their minds even if they sit through this because they are too heavily invested in the status quo. They aren't the target audience though, he's looking for open minds, and those who believe the earth is more than a rock. I've noticed a very bizarre overlap in those who deny climate change, with all its supporting scientific facts, yet believe in the ""Rapture"", which has not one scientific fact supporting it. Strange, eh?Buy three on DVD, give two as gifts. The message should be spread if we are to counter the regressive echo chamber. If we can counter climate change before it turns catastrophic, we'll give the deniers the chance to say ""see, it never happened"". It's better than mass extinctions and the upset of large biosystems at any rate."	5.0	breaking through right wing distortions	2006-09-11	15	9	6
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AFYZ8YB1YW36W	"Jim Harrigan ""the dirt man"""	A boy waits for a bus one early morning in his rural midwestern town.  He looks forward to another day with his teacher and schoolmates.  He ponders what activities might lay ahead.  Will there be singing, will there be games, or will there be arts and crafts?  But over the horizon moves an ominous cloud of black rolling forth over the sky.  Suddenly, the prairie falls to darkness. It is like nighttime again, but this is a miserable penetrating waft that is choking and smothering.The boy becomes one of the first to have fallen to climate change in the country called America.  If he had seen the bus on its way he might have gotten on it, but that would have been no use.  Even the bus sits silently in the midst of the fallen dust.  Later, throughout the 1930's the Dust Bowl would take the lives of many more as dust pneumonia grew.  Average global temperatures would reach peaks not previously seen during America's history.  The parched soil blew from Kansas to Washington D.C. when a Congressional Assembly would walk outside to witness the gathering clouds that have rolled so far.From there, farm managers, educators, and government agents would slowly develop better farm practices for wind-blown soils in semi-arid climates.  Then there would be a reprieve from the heat for a time, and slowly memories would scatter.Climate change would take lives in other lands as drought and famine hits Africa in 1982.  Europe was not immune - a heat wave takes the lives of tens of thousands.Throughout the 90's there would be new record high global temperatures.  In 2003 climate change would appear in America taking the form of hurricanes like no one has ever seen.  Again in 2004, and again in 2005 as this film, An Inconvenient Truth, was being made.  Levees would break in a storm called Katrina, and the ensuing nightmares come true would leave in its wake a beloved city wrapped in death, sickness and homelessness.  New Orleans would awaken again, and I pray that it will prosper.  Still to come, Rita would devastate our oil distributors affecting the lives of everyone that drives a car, but it would be Wilma that would register the most powerful hurricane force ever known to humankind.I was thinking about how An Inconvenient Truth should be remembered.  It occured to me that I had never taken a moment to remember all the victims of climate change in America.  We should all give just a moment.We are grateful that we can heat our homes, cook our meals, and light our doorway.  We are grateful that we can drive and fly.  We are grateful that we can power our workplaces, our stores, and our entertainment and recreational centers.  Do not fear, but do not take it for granted.  Remember those that have fallen.

With this film, Al Gore has made an impact on American society that he never could have with hundreds of speeches. Long known as a passionate advocate for doing something about global warning before it's too late, Gore has criss-crossed the country speaking to groups about the irrefutable scientific evidence supporting the idea that greenhouse gasses are going to cause serious disruption on the planet in the not-too-distant future. This documentary captures his lecture from beginning to end, while skillfully weaving in details about Gore's personal life. The scenes when he talks about his family's tobacco farm and his sister's death from lung cancer are particularly poignant. Interspersed in the credits are a number of simple, practical ideas anyone can follow to contribute in a tiny way to the solution. What a lot of consciousness-raising Gore has accomplished!As I watched this film, I wondered if Gore, like Jimmy Carter, is destined to make his mark on America in a way far more effectively than he would have done as a successful politician.And of course, comparisons to the White House's current occupant are inevitable.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AEE42UT3ERITN	"J. Nowicki ""The Boss and  Mrs. B."""	Al Gore and Davis Guggenheim have combined to make a compelling documentary.An Inconvenient Truth is promoted as a visual revelation about global warming.Often we read an article in newspapers and magazines or see a short clip on the network news about the effect of global warming in the world and wonder how much is based on fact, fiction or a combination of both. Here, again, you must decide for yourself what is actual fact and what, if anything, has been slanted to support his viewpoint. An Inconvenient Truth gives you Al Gore's take on the validity of the trauma global warming has upon our world. Notably absent were the voices of any scientists to corroborate his assertions. The film is about that issue and what he says is not being done worldwide to combat the danger it presents to life as we know it today.An Inconvenient Truth should be mandatory viewing in our schools, if only, to educate our youth about sifting fact from fiction in our throw away world.I did notice one remarkable personal fact that gave an insight into his upbringing. When his sister Nancy, his only sibling, died from lung cancer their father quit growing tobacco so as not to contribute to anyone else enduring such a loss. The Gore family showed integrity choosing moral responsibility over financial gain. The influence of coming from such a family, one would hope, would be reflected in Al Gore. However, his political chagrin was made quite apparent with his several references to his loss of the presidental election, causing me to suspect his only concern being that of global warming. It was unnecessary to the topic.As for the efforts our current political leaders are undertaking in regard to stopping global pollution, unfortunately, as is the norm, political power and financial gain appear to be worth more than moral integrity and personal responsibility in facing this issue.I recall a saying my father had, 'only fools and dead men never change'.To the best of my knowledge all were alive and well in Washington, DC.

Previously I saw my mission in life as the following: become a doctor, serve the poor.  Other people can take care of the environment, animal rights, etc.  Maybe it's not the greatest movie in the world, but it changed my life and I finally understand what global warming really is (ie it's not just about polar bears, it really is the immediate future, and I owe it to the world around me to be a responsible consumer).  Since the viewing this movie, I have made the following changes:1. No more individual coke, water, or sports drink bottles.2. I will not be able to give up starbucks (location is at the hospital I work), so I bought a starbucks plastic mug which they fill for me every morning - so no more coffee cups in the trash.  I use that same cup for water and tea during the day.3. I will never buy another car that gets less than 40 miles to the gallon.4. I turned my thermostat down to 68 degrees (from 70).  Although we haven't really needed the heater this year at all.6. I am finally on board with my husband's quest to recycle in a place that doesn't really make it easy to recycle (cincinnati/northern kentucky) as well as his little compost project.7. My goal is to pass the dvd on to 100 people over the next 6 months who otherwise woudln't have seen it. Maybe they will make some changes too	5.0	changed	2007-01-06	11	8	3

The people who most need to be educated about global warming live on the rich Northern half of the planet. In the northern hemisphere, storms rotate COUNTERclockwise. What idiot did the graphic showing the hurricane rotating clockwise? And what moron approved it? Al Gore should be wondering why these people are sabotaging his credibility, and right there on the cover of the DVD, no less! Fire them, and correct the cover!(The same thing happened with the film, ""The Day After Tomorrow"". I counted all the times that they had storms in the northern hemisphere rotating clockwise. It was over 50% of the time, and there were a lot of storms! That ruined the movie for me.)SO, if and when the DVD cover graphic is fixed, I will likely change my rating of the DVD.

Even if we had seen the film already, we are glad to see it again and show it to friends and relatives.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2TUA4VWCMNXI	John D. Cofield	An Inconvenient Truth is an important warning about the perils our civilization faces from global warming.  Vice President Al Gore demonstrates his keen intellect and powerful vision here, just as he has done for years with slideshows and powerpoints, to point out the danger of ignoring the signs of climate change and of taking no steps to alleviate or modify them.  The scientific material is presented cogently, so that anyone whose mind is not closed can grasp what in other hands would be dreary and technical.The film also fills the perceptive viewer with regret that the Supreme Court stepped into the 2000 election and denied the Presidency to this gifted, articulate man.  How differently and how much more positively the last eight years would have turned out!

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AZXGPM8EKSHE9	John	"M.I.T.'s Professor Richard Lindzen (Professor for Meteorology and Atmospheric Science) has already refuted at least part of Gore's work, for instance, in the Wall Street Journal. In a nutshell, Lindzen states that no one really knows enough about the global climate to really say what definitively will happen. Gore, the non-scientist, claims to know (sound familiar ?). Lindzen, the man who studies this subject at one of the best universities in the world, claims to not know enough. So I ask you, is Gore's position science, or dogma (or self-promotion, or something else) ? Of course, Gore and the global warming alarmists have gotten really, really mad at people like Lindzen who stand in their way with odd, ""petty"" scientific data. They said that Lindzen is  in the pocket of ""Big Oil"". That is how they treat anyone who stands in the way of their message. Gore claims that global warming could result in Manhattan sinking under the ocean. And yet, scientists have refuted that claim. Would it be so tragic if Minneapolis or Novosibirsk (or Boston, for that matter) were 3 degrees warmer in winter ? The claim that the Atlantic pump could reverse has also been refuted and disproven. They don't take into account the fact that the sun changes its temperature, and that that affects the earth.I give credit to Gore for making us aware of the environment. I consider myself an environmentalist. But if parts of Gore's ""evidence"" has been refuted, why should I not doubt the other parts ?"	2.0	Partially refuted	2007-01-08	26	7	19

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AYJ1LXTRU0QAV	John K. Ickes	The hard science behind global warming should be common knowledge to most everyone. Unfortunately, it still isn't, and the oil interests wouldn't have it any other way. As an optimist, Gore thinks there may be enough time to prevent extreme global catastrophes. I sure hope so, but as a pessimist, I think we all may be heading to disaster. Rising CO-2 (carbon dioxide) levels are causing record high temperatures all over the planet. In the last 14 years, scientists have noted that we have had the 10 hottest years on record since the 1860's. About 35,000 Europeans died from the heat wave of 2003. We may all be at risk of slowly baking to death, creating a literal hell on earth. You can thank the oil companies, oil lobbyists and primarily the Republicans who have successfully put greed before the environment for over four decades. They have quite successfully suppressed the message of global warming for over 30 years. To paraphrase Gore, without an earth, how will they be able to enjoy their mountains of ill-gotten gold, anyway? Stupid, greedy people will be the death of us, themselves, all our children and perhaps all life on this planet. God help us. Gore offers way to reduce CO-2 in the atmosphere, if you want to do something about it.	5.0	Mass Extinction from Greed	2007-02-27	15	8	7

He posits many challenging bits of evidence but does not leave you with the information you need to make a real change.  I feel that the data is well presented and most likely correct but he leaves out the big message, which I feel is about our absurd oil gluttony, and the concept that it will peak in the next few years (or already has) and demand will forevermore outstrip supply, and what that means for suburbia, and our food supply.

However if fossil fuel burning is responsible for this tiny increase, why does half of the ""warm up"" occur between 1900 and 1945. Why isn't there significant warming in the second half of the century when so much more fuel was being burned? Hmmmmm?Yet, Gore & company warn of coastal flooding as the glaciers melt. The ""inconvenient truth"" is that while some glaciers are melting, others are not. Some are growing! Note the report in 2005 by Norwegian, Russian and American scientists that Greenland's ice is thickening and not melting. (Ola Johannessen, et al. ""Climate Change."" Science, November 2005)""The Ice Caps are melting!! Sea levels will rise!!"" Really? Such drivel shows a real lack of scientific understanding. Ice caps are after all, floating ice. Not a land mass. To see how water levels will rise try this little scientific experiment. Take a bowl. Fill it half full of water. Add a lot of ice cubes or a block of ice. Mark the level of the water once that is done. Let it melt. Note the water level has not risen because the ice melted. Duh!!The predictions of global warming are based on computer models done by some scientists who have made a great living out of scaring the bejesus out of the rest of us. Those are the same type of models who told us in the 70's to prepare for global cooling and the return of the Ice Age. Just as figures don't lie and liars can figure, a computer model can be made to produce any desired outcome that the programmer wants. And the Gore crowd wants doom, gloom and disaster. Coming right up!!There is no question that the Gore movie is an impressive piece of propoganda. If you accept what he says at face value you will become as hopelessly fearful as many of the reviewers on here. However, Orson Wells was similarly successful for a brief period of time with a Mercury Theater radio broadcast concerning a Martian invasion. He scared a lot of people who thought they were listening to the real thing. His radio broadcast had about as much scientific basis as Gore's doomsday predictions about global warming.He is selling snake oil and there is no truth in his claims."	1.0	An Inconvenient Myth and Miles from the Truth	2006-07-06	196	49	147

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2DSXA1E02C86D	Joseph Haschka	"Despite what you may think of Al Gore and/or the concept of global warming, AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH is a compelling and eminently lucid exposition of the latter, and Al doesn't come off too shabbily either. Is the former ""next President of the United States"" planning on running again? That's probably not his overt intention. But if the Democratic kingmakers came on bended knee (""Al, only you can save The Republic!"" or, even better, ""Al, only you can save Earth!""), would he say ""no""? (Already I'm seeing bumper stickers at the local Democratic Party booths, ""The Democrats will solve global warming!"" Gee, you think?)Sprinkled with folksy childhood reminiscences and mea culpas about the Gore family's previous misguided participation in tobacco farming , AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH is a slick visual presentation comprised of photographs, video, and scientific data graphs, by which Al will make you believe - if you don't already - that the world as we know it is doomed by the ever increasing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Disastrous climate changes, the resurgence of old diseases and the emergence of new afflictions, melting ice, and rising sea levels that will spur massive population migrations are all in the offing over the next 100 years. Lawdy, lawdy, Miz Sca'lett, whatever is we to do?AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH is the first film I've ever seen where the ending credits incorporate exhortations to do PC stuff. ""Recycle""; I do. ""Drive a hybrid""; I would but the price mark-up negates what I'd save on gas. ""Take public transport""; I did but gave it up because it morphed my 90-minute round trip to and from the 9 to 5 to 180 minutes. ""Use energy efficient appliances""; I do because the city pays installation rebates. ""Set the thermostat at 82""; I do because my wife makes me. ""Vote for candidates that support the Kyoto Agreement""; I would if the crooks will otherwise stay out of my wallet. ""Plant trees""; cool, I could use the firewood. The movie doesn't reveal if Al follows any or all of these precepts. However, he does, apparently, expend a lot of jet fuel gallivanting about on international junkets presenting his slide show. Couldn't he just video conference the thing via satlink? As our hero of the piece says, the technology is there.At one point, Gore uses data from ice cores to plot the Earth's average temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide level over the past 160,000 years before extrapolating such over the next couple of generations. (By the way, nice job operating the power lift, Al, but a simple ladder would have consumed no electricity.) But he doesn't put this into the perspective of time. The globe is now thought to be about 4.5 billion (that's ""billion"" with a B) years young, over which period the Earth on its own, and without human help, has exterminated countless species with the ostensible connivance of the occasional meteor impact. Presumably, until the Sun goes supernova, the Earth will last a few more years - millions and millions by my guess - while presiding over the eradication of even more life forms including perhaps our own.Al's perspective is homocentric, i.e., there's the implication that Homo sapiens as a species has the God-given right to infest the planet in perpetuity, and any serious impediment to that, such as man-made global warming, is unethical. The past and future Earth is perhaps above any such human morality construct. If, as Gore has convinced me, global warming ultimately results in the most dire consequences imaginable - elevated oceans, apocalyptic climatic shifts, massive population migrations, famines, wars, and pestilences - a resilient Mother Earth will ultimately reset itself, with or without human riders, after the greenhouse gases settle. Indeed, I'd expect a new Ice Age in about 20,000 years - and a real doozy at that; stock up on warm knickers now. So, feel free to do all that PC stuff if it makes you feel like a responsible citizen of the world. In the long, long, long, very long run, it makes no difference.Hillary is probably kicking herself for not having such a vehicle to elbow her way into the public eye pending the 2008 presidential contest.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1DNZZT2FPOTZQ	Joseph Holmes	Even with the 30-minute update added to the DVD, major, critical results of recently published Earth and climate science are missing from the stunning picture drawn by An Inconvenient Truth. Recent discoveries regarding global dimming by our particulate pollution having offset about 65% of our warming, about the majority of ancient mass extinctions having been caused by volcanic warming events over long periods of time, and about the history of Antarctica's ice sheet -- which show that we could easily melt nearly all of it's ice by merely doubling atmospheric CO2, combine to paint a picture of unimaginably severe consequences from our seemingly modest average warming already seen. The problem is that the planet was not in an inherently stable condition, rather the Arctic and the sea floor contained elements which were set to produce massive, positive feedbacks in response to our initial push.  Start reading.  Start talking.  And leave fossil carbon fuels behind, or soon it will be too late to save the planet from such catastrophes as a 25 degree F average global temperature increase, an eventual 330-foot rise in sea level, and the end of the ozone layer from hydrogen sulphide gas released by a heated-up, anaerobic ocean.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1TKM36EYEQNSM	Joseph J. Slevin	I first heard of this movie when a friend of mine sent me and a few others a very sobering email.  She was very forthright, you need you must see this movie were her words.  I am glad she sent me that email a few months ago and I have wanted to write about this movie for quite some time.The DVD is just downright sobering.  It is sort of a journey for Al Gore, a man whom I now respect a whole lot more than ever before.  This seems now to be his lifes work.  He exhibited passion in what he tells in this documentary.  I have heard a lot about the other side of the story, but really folks, we have to do something about the environment.Seemingly, we will be inconvenienced either by a disaster or doing something immediately to avert it.  Gore touches so many things, his life, his life's work, the effect of tobacco farming on his family.  The movie is an autobiographical sketch of a man with a desire to see this earth survive for all of us.There is some politics in it for sure. He is a politician.  But the sobering facts are there, whether 100% accurate or not, there is definately quite a lot we have to do to solve our environmental problems.  He claims it is not too late, but my question is, when will it be?I have heard the opposite side of the arguements, even one thing not in the context of global warming that in Scotland in the past there was a time when they had a wine industry because it was so warm.  There was also a time in history prior to Europeans in the Americas where the native population could walk across the NY bay in winter because it was so cold.  Gore answers this with a chart of the cold and warm periods across the centuries.  My questions and doubts were stopped right there.  He had me.MAYBE ONE FAULT:If there is anything I would like to caution someone who sees the movie to think about it is this.  The movie claims it is bipartisan and yes, it is a very bipartisan issue.  In the movie you have scenes of Reagan, Bush I and Bush II denouncing something to do with the environment but we are not totally sure of the context.ONE QUESTION:Mr. Gore speaks of all the years where he was resisted in his quest to get this addressed and I am sure he was resisted and has been rebuffed again and again.  Yet, his first two years as a VP the Dems had control of the Legislative and Executive, he does not address the dynamics of that time and he seems to indicate the resistance is mostly a Republican one.  I hope that some day we get a view of what occurred during that time when he may have had an opportunity to proceed.Finally, we have been warned and we as a people must make the right choices starting now to improve our chances of surviving and thriving in the years, decades and centuries ahead.	5.0	Potential Disaster at Critical Mass - chilling to say the least	2007-02-01	13	10	3

I figured it would regurgitate much of what I already knew, and ultimately although I believe global warming is currently largely due to human activity, I didn't feel like seeing a movie that was likely just ""preaching to the choir"".But I was very wrong. The film did repeat a fair bit of data I had heard previously, but there was also plenty that was new. And the uplifting message (the idea that this is a problem that we can certainly fix, as long as we get started and can move forward with the necessary steps) makes it a pleasurable watch."	5.0	Surprisingly good	2007-03-30	19	11	8

Sea levels will rise!!"" Really? Such drivel shows a real lack of scientific understanding. Ice caps are after all, floating ice. Not a land mass. To see how water levels will rise try this little scientific experiment. Take a bowl. Fill it half full of water. Add a lot of ice cubes or a block of ice. Mark the level of the water once that is done. Let it melt. Note the water level has not risen because the ice melted. Duh!!------------------------------------------------------------Now, if that reviewer actually saw the movie, he would have seen the same experiment reinacted on the screen.  The problem isn't the ice that's already in the oceans melting.  The problem is, when that ice melts, the 'dam' or barrier to the land-based ice is removed and that land-based ice then flows into the ocean raising sea level.Do the above experiment and then add a handfull of ice and watch the water level rise.The facts that Mr. Gore presents are strong and well thought out.  I do hope that people listen and collectivelly try to change.  However, that won't be the case.  People seem to need a disaster to incite action.  The threat of terrorism was just as real before 9/11 as it was after, but it took that disaster to incite action and in some cases overreaction.The movie is a great documentary even if you don't believe in the subject.  It is well thought out, humorous in just the right places, and makes its point clearly.  This film reinforces in my mind that entertainment can also be educational.If you don't believe the science presented here, then present the facts and citations, but the reality of the situation is that I believe humanity will have to be dealt a catastrophe greater than 10 'New Orleans' type disasters in order to rid our addiction to fossel fuels and the production of greenhouse gasses.Oh well, it's only our children who loose.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AHL55ZFUB8561	J. Raber	For all the reviewers who question the science behind this movie, I wonder, did you even see it?  The idea of global warming is not based on evidence that the earth has suddenly been warming up.  The idea of global warming is based on three indisputable facts:1)  Through burning of fossil fuels, we have increased CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere to levels never before seen in the history of the earth2)  CO2 is a greenhouse gas, meaning it traps heat in the earth's atmosphere3)  For the past hundreds of thousands of years, there has been a direct correlation between fluctuations in the earth's temperature and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphereWith these three facts in mind, how can you come to any other conclusion than that our CO2 emmisions are going to unnaturally drive up the earth's temperature?  It is irrelevant to argue that the earth is going through some kind of natural warming/cooling cycle, because it does not have any bearing on these three facts.  Using the natural warming cycle argument against global warming is like turning on the oven and saying it's only going to heat up as a result of the ambient temperature in the kitchen.  Although he doesn't say it in so many words, this is the point Gore drives at in the film.As far as an actual review of the movie, I thought it was captivating and well made.  The only downside I feel is that it was Al Gore who made it--not because I hate Al Gore, but because people think the movie's just a political stunt, which it is NOT.  I hope people will be open-minded enough to give this movie a chance regardless of political affiliations, because it is perhaps the most important documentary you will ever see.	5.0	To the skeptics...	2006-07-19	25	17	8

Seems like the same people like to defend the same causes (all which lend damage to the environment).Why not take some responsibility for a change? This movie has certainly raised some interesting questions and should be taken seriously. If you disagree with the facts then research it for yourself, but don't use talk radio as your source for information. That's just lazy. Some of the ""1"" ratings do agree ""While Global Warming is an important issue and we certainly do have something to do with the rapidity of the process, if you want serious facts and the actual truth for a change, this isn't the movie for you"" (taken from a previous posting), then what is the movie for us? You're not going to recommend another science fiction movie I hope. If you believe global warming is an issue you would have at least given this movie a two or three, but maybe the brain washing isn't on this side. Hmm Hmm.This is definately the movie for you and all others. It's ignorant to think that humans have no fault in the condition of the environment. We have had the power to destroy the ozone layer and aid in it's repair. That's pretty amazing. I think we can do the same for global warming.

Disaster books sell well too, so there is little incentive in telling the dull truth that the earth's climate is cyclical with natural warm-ups and cool-downs occurring every few hundred years.And of course the Left loves Global Warming because, being crazed anti-big business environmentalist; they can use it to thwart construction of new oil-refineries, pipelines, power plants, factories, and industry of all kinds. As added bonus they hope to scare people out of their cars and onto the mass-transit systems they so love. The C. Smokers; let them ride busses and subways if they want, just leave me the heck alone.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2DN0M1UNH7C6U	"J. Zeiger ""Say something about yourself!"""	An Inconvenient Truth is an award-winning documentary that chronicles Al Gore's involvement in educating others about the very serious impact humans, especially Americans, are having on our environment. I've wanted to see this movie for months and finally had the chance this weekend. This is a powerful film that, in my opinion, every American should see. I hope that seeing this film will get individuals thinking about how we affect the Earth and what we can do to help.What struck me about An Inconvenient Truth was that it included enough information to convey a powerful message without overwhelming the viewer with facts and figures. It was simple enough to be understood by someone who might not be familiar with environmental issues which I think is especially important. Charts and graphs were included when necessary to define the climate changes we have experienced and will experience for years to come if lawmakers don't act soon.I also liked the fact that An Inconvenient Truth focused on the environmental issues rather than politics. US policy was discussed, but I felt that, in general, the filmmakers did an excellent job of reaching out to a bipartisan audience. Viewers were shown well-researched data regarding global warming, including powerful pictures and other graphics that enhanced the viewer's understanding of the issue. While Al Gore was featured in the film, his life was certainly not the focus. Instead, the story of his passion for this cause left viewers like myself feeling informed as well as inspired to take action and speak out about this issue.While many reviews of An Inconvenient Truth can be found online, I thought Roger Ebert's review of the film was very good. I also enjoyed A. O. Scott's New York Times review, finding it especially insightful.	5.0	Motivating Film and Great Info	2007-05-14	0	0	0

The remainder, which combines biographical moments from Gore's life played a little too much like one of the candidate bio films played at political conventions.  Thanks to modern technology those parts are easy to fast forward through and thus do not detract at all from the lecture portions -- which are compelling.  The best part is the timeline -- which is the one part I showed to my 11 year old that convinced him utterly.Gore also does a wonderful job of demonstrating how absurd ""conventional wisdom"" can be -- without ever taking the scientific establishment head on -- he takes a great example from his youth (and mine) when our grade school teachers (and approved textbooks) completely ruled out the notion that the continents actually fit together at one time, despite the coincidental similarities in coastlines.Gore's recommendations as to what to do about the problems he identified are thoughtprovoking in unusual ways.  How to deal with this ""uncomfortable truth"" without surrendering to despair or helplessness?  This may be as inevitable as plate tectonics!!Here's a man who was both Senator and Vice President, ran for President, and was utterly unable to do anything about it -- now he is doing the only thing he can think of, which is to go out and present these facts one lecture at a time.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2JEPRZWEG1EUL	Kara Foster	"I was reading over criticisms, such as the theory that an ice cube in a glass of water will not change the water levels.  That's strange, Gore used this exact same imagery to illustrate that land-based glaciers, which are not already in water, do in fact melt to raise water levels.Someone else said that it's the natural cycle of things, and Gore didn't fully go into this.  Well, what's with that chart that *showed* the natural cycle of things, including the last six or so ice ages, and then showed where we are now - far above the hot eras the world has seen before?As for the world warming up over the last 20th century, the early half included, where are the numbers there?  Gore showed information on a year by year basis in most cases.  What grabbed me especially was that the recorded ten hottest years in history happened within the last two decades, 2005 being the hottest.  How do you explain that away with averaging out the changes over a century?Some of the criticisms I saw made actual points, such as that some glaciers are getting bigger.  This is the kind of debate that actually works, not just picking holes that can be filled by rewatching the movie.  The thing about the upper atmosphere not getting hotter sounds fishy or nit-picky, but that was close to a good point.  I'll probably look into both of those, so good job, skeptics.I personally found this documentary to be very enlightening, as it gave concrete facts that I have not been exposed to before.  It tied in things such as hurricanes and draught, things that humans should actually be concerned with, even if they can somehow ignore all the ""little"" things like ocean level trends and air pollution.  It also not only explained ecological effects of global warming, but how it relates to us, such as the point about insect populations and diseases.I figured there would be some criticism for this coming out in a congressional election year.  The fact is, wouldn't you rather know about this when there's something we can do?  If it's for Gore's personal gain that's one thing.  But wouldn't it be much better to keep environmental issues in mind when we are electing leaders, knowing now that it is an issue?  I would say so.I gave it four stars because of Gore's tangeants into his personal life and political career that were not always strongly tied in.  But as for the actual facts, and the actual conclusions drawn, I would give this five stars."	4.0	If you gave one star, you probably didn't watch the movie.	2006-07-20	26	18	8

He weaves in stories of his personal life, his political life, and the life of his ancestors.  This demonstrates that not only is this a political move on his part, but how what he has to say is effecting people just like you and I.  He knows exactly who he is targeting in this documentary, and hits a wide range of Americans.Covers many facets of the threat of Global Warming, including statistics of weather, seasons, natural disasters, and more.  He has worked closely with many scientists and researchers that back up his statements throughout.Not only does this documentary show you all the problems, but gives you reasonable solutions of how you as the individual can make an impact.  Not by spending lots of money or volunteer time, but very simple choices that can be so easy to integrate into one's normal and busy lifestyle.	5.0	This is worth more than time and money to watch...	2007-06-01	4	1	3
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AY46DEOJJYFTW	Kerry O. Burns	what is indisputable is that our climate is undergoing changes the like of we have never seen before. This is one man's attempt to save our planet before we reach the tipping point. The tipping point being a point in time when no attempt by man can make any difference, sort of like a large rock rolling down a hill, once that rock gets to rolling it becomes nearly impossible to stop it. So don't shoot the messenger, listen to the messsage. This is not about blue or red states this is about the most pressing moral question of our time and what are we going to do about it if we can do anything. When I saw this in the movie theatre, I could hear the audience at times gasp and at the end applaud. People were clearly moved. Al Gore is not saying anything that hasn't been already voiced by scientists all over the world he's just saying it in a way that really reaches people. Please watch this and educate yourself more and hope the tipping point has not already been reached as some believe. James Lovelock believes it is already too late.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A14PRNE36WARUH	Kevin T. Scott	When the scientific facts about climate change are seriously looked into the only inconvenient truth is Vice President Gore needs to find another celebrity cause.  A passionate speaker can sway many people that are already leaning towards a given theory.  It quickly becomes evident that once the predicted ice age of the late '70s and early '80s didn't pan out the only direction to go was the opposite or global warming. What should cause most people to pause and think is that when the noise dies down the only solution to global warming given by it's theorists is to vote for a certain political party.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A282SV3AIUE154	"K. Feucht ""OncoDoc"""	"This film is labeled a documentary, but its entire format is really that of a sermon by Rev. Algore. There is very little documentary here. Included are also occasional testimonials by supposedly notable figures. There is much political jabbing, some of which is justified, but most of which is not. Approximately 95% of the entire film has at least 40% of the screen filled with Rev. Algore's face. There are multiple clips that just don't relate to the thesis of global warming, such as a complaint about how the votes were tallied in Florida, with the subsequent Supreme Court ruling, and no explanation as to what this had to do with the ""inconvenient truth"" of this film. The film is entirely about global warming, but unknowingly shows how Rev. Algore is particularly skilled at depleting carbon units, although he is exempt since he alone is allowed to consume mass quantities of energy. I can't imagine the energy required to run Rev. Algore under the North Pole in a nuclear submarine and surface through the ice, just to add a 2 minute episode to the sermon. I could go on and on. Rev. Algore sanctimoniously suggests that the family farm quit growing tobacco because of the concern over lung cancer, yet it almost certainly was a result of declining reimbursements from tobacco. Rev. Algore's tone of voice, inflections, and speaking style were much more like a sermon than a documentary. The fools who gave this film an Academy Award fail to offer how this film stood out in quality and credible research. The entire thesis of the film is based on supposed rising atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, while Rev. Algore maintains a schoolboy belief in the accuracy and significance of the data and its extrapolations, without any questioning of the data. It shows the absurd fallacy of having a lawyer/politician pretend to be doing credible science. There is no doubt that there is some truth to what Rev. Algore is saying. There is a retreat of glaciers in the last few decades. There are certain interesting climate changes. Yet, Rev. Algore fails to substantiate the exact causal nature of these events, and chooses instead to promote emotionalism and extreme reactions, exactly what he accuses the Republican party of doing, though on other issues. If Rev. Algore didn't make so many hard jabs at his political opponents, he might have gained a few more sympathetic ears. Making the weather a political rather than a pure environmental issue makes Rev. Algore ineffective and suspect as to his true intentions for making this film. It is thus hard for me to give this film even one star. It is not worth purchasing, though a single viewing is of value only to see the many gorgous faces of Rev. Algore. Global warming supporters may have a credible argument, but it certainly is not given in this film."	1.0	A sermon and not a documentary	2011-01-16	18	6	12

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1TSKKBNV38E8Y	"K. Harriger ""K.R. Harriger"""	On the whole, I think Gore did an excellent job of laying out the facts without heavy editorializing. This film was clean, well-edited and well-written. The clear presentation of the facts presents an overwhelming case for a dangerous increase in global warming, and when I hear people claim that the global warming issue is just a political move by the left, I have to wonder where they're getting their information, since they clearly aren't looking at the facts. My only gripe, which prevented me from giving it a five-star rating, is that Gore just couldn't stop sticking in clips about his lost election to Bush in 2000. The early clip about Bush was well-placed and funny, but Gore just couldn't seem to let it go and had to keep coming back to it. The later references had a bit of a sour-grapes feel to them, and  I suspect that without these clips the film could have reached even more people. I feel that because of these sidebars into politics, Mr. Gore just gave ammunition to the Right to turn this into a political issue, and I believe that while he had good intentions, these additions may have been a distraction from the core message. I have noticed from talking to many friends that they felt the same way, including many who were sympathetic to Mr. Gore but annoyed by the fact that the 2000 campaign clips and comments seemed very out of context after a certain point. In spite of this problem, however, I highly recommend that everyone see this film and take action on the powerful and alarming message it contains. This isn't a political issue, and it's my hope that anyone clinging to the notion that it is will look past any political content and grasp the facts of the matter (and then act on them).	4.0	Very good film but could have been improved by leaving a few things out.	2007-01-10	10	7	3

McDonald ""Kasey"""	This movie does a good job of explaining the truth of global warming and its impact on our planet's future and the future of species that inhabit it.It is filled with power points, lectures by Gore, and stories of Gore's life, but I actually like the way these things were intertwined for several reasons:1) the facts of global warming need to be simply portrayed and not overdramatized to reveal the truth of it to skeptics2) scientific facts of rising CO2 levels and its potential impact were discovered decades ago, and Gore was one of the first to take it seriously3) the similarities between the tobacco industry and its attempts to obscure the truth and the oil industry and its attempts to obscure the truth SIMPLY FOR PROFIT AND TO SUSTAIN ITS EMPIRE are profound4) this issue must be politicized, because lobbyists are working hard to prevent environmental awareness and delay addressing this problem.  Also, people are too busy or too unwilling to change their habits.  Someone must counteract that pressure and encourage change on a large scale.  Plus, no one would try to use something as unpopular as ceaselessly promoting environmental awareness as a presidential campaign strategy.  The movie shows that Gore puts the environment first, uses the government as a vehicle to preserve it, and dislikes politicians who dismiss it.FYI- Just look at the difference in reporting on a recent case:[...][...]So, see the movie.  It is an eye opener.

Global warming seems to draw out complex reactions from all of us.  So, you can watch this documentary and believe it whole-heartedly or with a grain of salt.*An Inconvenient Truth* is basically Al Gore's presentation on global warming.  You really are watching a lecture accompanied with PowerPoint presentations.  You'll be shown statistics and pictures of the Earth and environments of the last few years, decades and ice ages.  You'll also be shown estimated/projected statistics for the next 50 years.  These facts and statistics aren't pretty or something to laugh at.  In fact, they should make you sit up and be alarmed.I learned something about Al Gore.  He is really informed and passionate about environmental issues.  He can explain these facts and statistics in laymen terms.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2T049UQONS0OY	Larry VanDeSande	"Al Gore's movie about the affects of climate change and global warming is less an enlightenment than confirmation for people that have followed the intellectual discourse on the topic. Gore provides commentary and evidence that confirms, rather than discloses, changing patterns of planetary warming and mounting chlorine in the atmosphere.Gore has apparently been going around the world giving a spiel on this topic for some time, using video and other evidence to support his presumptions. Since there is little real controversy about the topic any longer -- virtually every naysayer belongs to some organization supported by either energy providers or another group with a financial stake in denying these worldwide changes -- the film is less a revelation than a confirmation of what others have said and presented for years.The film is full of visions of snow-capped mountains with their snow melted, ice cap diminution at the poles, charts of increasing temperature and pollutants in the atmosphere, etc. It is topically presented in a nonscientific way that makes the film more of a pop art than documentary experience.What is missing from this film? There are some things, of course. Gore presents no evidence to support claims that chlorine in the atmosphere gravitates to the poles, which is why the hole in the ozone layer is worst at the South Pole. For this reason, Australians and New Zealanders are required to wear extra protection agains the sun's increasingly dangerous rays. There wasn't anything about this in Gore's movie.Still, it is evidenciary and entertaining, probably more so the former than latter. While many of my friends were overwhelmed by this movie in the same way ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" bowled them over, I was moderately entertained and impressed. I don't deny its message, I just don't think it's the greatest thing since indoor plumbing. I've seen and heard much of it before."	4.0	Science as entertainment	2007-04-12	13	7	6
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3MP6CTOA638HR	Laura	I think someday we will look back at Al Gore as the guy who saved us all - that is if we wise up and heed his warnings. I was impressed with his tireless approach, and patient, hopeful demeanor. If you are a global warming sceptic, I dare you to watch this movie. See if it doesn't make you want to buy a Prius and some energy efficient lightbulbs.I know there are some Republicans who argue that higher MPG standards and environmental laws are bad for corporations and therefore bad for the economy, but I honestly can't think of anything worse for the economy than mass environmental chaos. Just think of it this way, if global warming isn't real and we find alternative energy sources, and learn to take care of the planet better, what have we lost? If global warming is real (and even that crazy George Bush is acknowledging it now) and we don't act, where will we be? Let's clean up our act. It is not that hard.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2S7AZEXOIEI26	Lauren	"Toward the end of this documentary, a quote by Upton Sinclair is given that states, ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."" Such is the difficulty in trying to get the average citizen to understand climate change (""global warming"" as it is called in this movie) and to do something about it. It is a great documentary on a crucial issue, though the argument isn't very strong and there really isn't any solution espoused.To begin, the premise is wrong. Early on it is stated that global warming is a moral issue, not a political one. But then they go on to make a political argument.Then, the rationale behind the argument is not really put together well. It is assumed that we need to measure CO2--but why does this help the study? It is assumed that CO2 causes a rise in temperature--but why is this the case? It is assumed that CO2 is a man-made pollutant--but the documentary even states that 30% of the CO2 comes from forest fires. Finally, it is assumed that higher CO2 is the cause and not just correlated to a rise in temperatures--but how can a scientist be sure that the rise in temperature does not cause a rise in CO2? None of these questions are answered or even explored satisfactorily.The proof of global warming is fairly weak as well. We see pictures of melted snow caps and glaciers. But, one wonders, is this not possibly just a part of normal cycles? The snow cap that I lived by for years would disappear every summer--it's a natural cycle. The skeptic is left with more questions than answers. How common is it in history for glaciers to melt? Are there any glaciers forming elsewhere to compensate for the melting ones?To be fair, the documentary does not claim to make the argument for or against Al Gore's proposed changes. It is designed to simply convey the story of his outreach program. Still, I can't imagine anyone wanting to watch this program and not receive a good case for global warming. Unfortunately, it is not here. The documentary is more than anything a well-made question provoker. For that it is worth watching.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1IWWRZJOXOSYP	Lee Armstrong	"I read Al Gore's ""Earth in the Balance: Ecology & the Human Spirit"" when he was vice president.  It brought environmental issues to the fore that are extremely important.  In this video, I believe he transcends the political issues that he has as a former Democratic presidential nominee and makes a genuine effort to reach beyond the boundaries of our political parties to show that this is a human problem that affects all of us.  Yes, I've read some of the reviews here and heard repeatedly by political foes of the Kyoto accord that remain unconvinced that what the Earth now experiences is merely a routine cycle of heating and cooling.  Quite frankly, this ""ostrich syndrome"" is most unfortunate.  This is an issue that members of both parties should care about.  The increase in hurricanes and their fury should give pause to all who live in coastal areas, myself here in eastern North Carolina.  I think that there are SO many things happening on the planet that Gore is persuasive and convincing.  Those not ready to act really cannot see the forest for the trees.In this video, Gore strikes a good balance between education and making a video that's entertaining enough that you can sit through it for several hours.  The graphics, clips and animation are extremely helpful.  Yes, there is some background on Al Gore that is more biographical than issue oriented; but it sometimes takes a name to sell a cause.  Gore is putting his name solidly on the line.  I appreciate his courage.  I would have dearly enjoyed seeing if he could have made positive changes as president, but that will have to wait.  I'm mindful of his emphasis on chaos theory from ""Earth in the Balance"" where things build and build and then the effects happen very suddenly.  I hope we don't wait for further calamity before we find the resolve to protect this beautiful Earth we have been given.  The video's excellent.  Enjoy!"	5.0	This Beautiful Earth	2007-01-02	18	10	8

""Al Gore is a hypocrite and a fraud when it comes to his commitment to the environment, judging by his home energy consumption.""In the past year, Gore's home burned through 213,210 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, enough to power 232 average American households for a month.In February 2007, An Inconvenient Truth, a film based on a climate change speech developed by Gore, won an Academy Award for best documentary feature. The next day, the Tennessee Center for Policy Research uncovered that Gore's Nashville home guzzled 20 times more electricity than the average American household.After the Tennessee Center for Policy Research exposed Gore's massive home energy use, the former Vice President scurried to make his home more energy-efficient. Despite adding solar panels, installing a geothermal system, replacing existing light bulbs with more efficient models, and overhauling the home's windows and ductwork, Gore now consumes more electricity than before the ""green"" overhaul.Since taking steps to make his home more environmentally-friendly last June, Gore devours an average of 17,768 kWh per month -1,638 kWh more energy per month than before the renovations - at a cost of $16,533. By comparison, the average American household consumes 11,040 kWh in an entire year, according to the Energy Information Administration.In the wake of becoming the most well-known global warming alarmist, Gore won an Oscar, a Grammy and the Nobel Peace Prize. In addition, Gore saw his personal wealth increase by an estimated $100 million thanks largely to speaking fees and investments related to global warming hysteria.""Actions speak louder than words, and Gore's actions prove that he views climate change not as a serious problem, but as a money-making opportunity,"" Johnson said. ""Gore is exploiting the public's concern about the environment to line his pockets and enhance his profile.""The Tennessee Center for Policy Research, a Nashville-based free market think tank and watchdog organization, obtained information about Gore's home energy use through a public records request to the Nashville Electric Service.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Tennessee Center for Policy Research is an independent, nonprofit and nonpartisan research organization committed to achieving a freer, more prosperous Tennessee through the ideas of liberty.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1IUTYIY6PW8DU	L. F. Smith	"Discussions about the global warming issue can very quickly take on the tone of religious warfare, as some of the reviews here show.  I want to focus on the video as a video, reviewing some of its interesting features-- and some of its limitations.Those looking for an introduction to global warming should buy the book in addition to-- or maybe instead of-- the DVD.  Obviously, the film parallels the book, but it is, after all, a film of Gore giving his presentation.  That means that there's no way to look at the charts and graphs closely or to think about them before moving on.  In fact, some of them go by so quickly or lose so much detail as the camera pans out that it's not easy to understand what they're showing.Further, like the book, this is at most a very general introduction to global warming issues.  It's best suited to an audience that doesn't have much of a technical background.  (Like me; and, for the record, in the last year, I moved from the skeptic's camp to that of the non-fanatic believers.)  There certainly is a little Bush-bashing and a generally negative attitude toward Republican policies.  That's not too surprising, considering that Gore has spent his life as a Democratic political figure.  In any event, they're pretty mild.  While Gore's explanations of global warming are pretty convincing, his suggested solutions to the problem (mostly strict adherence to the Kyoto treaty and living a ""carbon-neutral"" lifestyle) seem to me to be very much open to debate.In my view, the impact of the film is somewhat reduced by the occasional personal vignettes about Gore's upbringing, his son's serious accident, and his sister's death.  I suspect that they were inserted in order to personalize Gore, much the same way that family shots and personal stories are inserted into football games.  That's fine, but to me, they were intrusions that were very nearly non sequiturs.On the other hand, one of the interesting things about the film is that it does indeed personalize Gore.  I voted for him in 2000, though with no real enthusiasm, and I've always seen him as an earnest but really boring gasbag.  Watching him in this film changed that for me.  He's clearly a guy with a passion for this issue; further, he's clearly intelligent and articulate.The film-as-film is very well done.  At first thought, the idea of a video of a guy giving a PowerPoint slide show seems like a very bad one for a film, but the director and camera people pull it off.  It's well paced, cleverly staged, well lighted, etc.  Lectures can be interesting, and this film demonstrates that.I thought the film was well worth seeing.  There is a lot to think about here, and it's a well-conceived and well-executed film, which probably does deserve its Oscar nomination.  It has limitations, but I'm glad I bought it, and I recommend it."	4.0	A Non-Political Review	2007-02-05	10	8	2

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A11ED8O95W2103	"lighten_up_already2 ""lighten_up_already2"""	"Well, I finally broke down and decided that I'd better see this movie so that I could at least discuss the movie, if not global warming in general, with people I come in contact with on a day-to-day basis.It was certainly more watchable than I thought it would be.  Not bad for a lecture and a slide show converted into a move.Still, there was something unsettling about the overall ambience or style of the movie, and that is this continual alteration between Gore at his slideshow in front of enrapt college students and these sentimental and emotionally manipulative cut away scenes where Gore is speaking in his soft and low voice, as if to me personally, about some experience in his life where he had an epiphany of some sort.  The most egregious being the incident where his son almost died in a traffic accident.Now, as a parent of two small boys I can understand how this would feel, and I sure wouln't wish something like this on anyone, but it seemed an over-the-top appeal to emotions in a movie that I thought was going to be a documentary with an emphasis on science and evidence.In fact, so much of this movie was like a campaign commercial for Al Gore.  Was the purpose of the movie to convince me to do something about global warming, or was it to make me unquestioningly loyal to Al Gore?  It seemed a little of each.Now for some particulars I found myself wondering about:1.  Al Gore's teacher who was ignorant of contenantal drift when Al was in sixth grade.  Wouldn't that be about 1959?  Gore said something to the effect that this is where science was at the time, but actually continal drift had been researched and vigerous debates had occured in the scientific community back in the 1920's.  I'm very sure the scientific community, if not Gore's ignorant teacher, accepted continental movement by the time Gore was in the sixth grade.2.  People who believe that the Earth is so big that man cannot possibly have an impact on the environment?  The only person I've ever heard say something like that was Rush Limbaugh.  I was around for the first Earth Day and I remember the ""deposit litter"" campaigns of the 60's.  This seemed like a straw man just for the purpose of knocking down.3.  ""It's not political; it's moral""  Well, I guess you can legislate morality after all.  Ha ha.4.  Too much capitalizing on hurricane Katrina.  That was cheap and too easy and intended to appeal to emotions.  Big storms have been happening for a long time, as the quote from Winston Churchill proved.5.  Al Gore walking through the airport with his luggage.  Yup, he flies coach just like the rest of us.  Of course, we don't see him actually sit down on the plane.6.  This whole idea that every real scientist agrees that man is responsible for global warming.  A search on this site in books will disprove that quick enough.7.  The only way Al Gore knows how to get his message across is city by city, person by person.  Savor the irony of hearing that in a massively hyped movie.8.  ""We worked together in a completely bipartisan way to bring down communism"".  I lived through much of the cold war, and I missed the bipartisan part.  Shoud've payed more attention I guess.9.  I can bring my individual carbon emmissions to zero?  When?  When I'm dead!  I'll stop breathing!  It's comforting to know that someday I, and all you reading this, will bring our carbon emmissions to zero.Well, I believe in global warming, but I'm not totally convinced as to what should be done about it.  I think we need an approach to spreading the message that's a little more inclusive than the old cliche of demonizing republicans and oil companies, but I'm sure that with millions of twenty-something non-conformists all thinking and talking the same way about the issue it's sure to be solved in my lifetime anyway.Or, maybe I should just move to higher ground."	3.0	The Gore Whisperer	2007-09-07	11	5	6

And it is a truth that affects every single person on the planet.Al Gore has spent the last few years wisely.  After he lost out on his presidential bid, he returned to a former favorite cause - the environment.  He has been traveling around the world giving a slide show describing the danger of global warming.  This film is that slide show.  Only difference is that he is not standing there in front of us in person.  He is on film.It is clear.  Very clear.  In fact, much too clear.  We are destroying our planet.  There are great graphics and charts and statistics as well as a touch of humanity as Mr. Gore deplores the awful environmental changes he's seen happen in his lifetime.  He's a great spokesperson for this cause. I believe it all.There's a danger out there.  It's more horrifying than terrorism or a nuclear bomb.  Every day, we are destroying our planet more and more.  He tries to give us some hope though.  He tries to show us that with the proper attention and legislation and waking up of the public, we can turn it around.  He tries to make us think that there is still something we can do.Frankly, I don't think there is anything that will stop our hurtling into destruction.  I feel nothing but despair. Maybe, though, just maybe, this film will be a catalyst to set the ball rolling to make changes.  I hope so.  But I don't think it will happen.I came away from the film feeling depressed.

This movie also made me aware that global warming isn't just a matter we can push aside- if nothing's done, it will be my generation and my kids generations that's hit the hardest with this.My only critique could be some of the flashbacks- as Gore talked about some of the politicons he came off a little bit bitter.  It seemed as if he was implying that if he was elected to office none of this would have happened.  Take what you will of this opinion, and I won't say more about this subject, as it's neither the place nor the time to argue about politics.  I just felt that the movie probably could have done without flashback's about his electons, though on the other hand some of the other flashbacks, such as the story about his sister really helped bring a sense of humanity to the movie.  While I definatly believe there has been a lot of propoganda concering global warning, I felt that some of the stuff he shared in this movie, were a bit to personal, and unrelated to the overall message.I truly think however that this is a film that every child and adult, especially in America should be required to see.  It shows us that we definatly have the power to change this, because if we don't we will soon reep the desatorous consequences.  As the Native American Proverb says ""We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children."""	4.0	"""Don't Blow it- Good planets are hard to find"" Time"	2007-01-19	6	3	3

The photographs that Gore shows are absolutely fascinating and really puts into perspective the global warming crisis we are facing.Additionally, I found Gore energetic, engaging, funny; just an overall excellent example of a wonderful public speaker.  Wait, did I really say that?  THIS Al Gore was not anything like the Al Gore we saw run for/win the presidency.  What is seen in this documentary is someone speaking about something that really matters, someone that cares about the issue at hand, and someone that is willing to put it all on the line for that issue.  It is a shame that most politicians do not have this kind of exuberance for the ""real"" issues we face as human beings.Even if you are not a fan of Gore, go see it to increase your knoweldge about the issues we face in terms of global warming.

An inconvenient truth is factual and based on the rigours of scientific testing, not the sensational small minded media hype and illusion used to anesthetize people, so they don't notice or care about real issues, in fact so they won't care about the real or important issues.If we don't finally succeed in making humanity extinct soon, will future generations hate us and treat our history with absolute contempt, resenting us as ignorant pigs? Are we knowingly condemning them to horrors because we thought we could be trusted to have sensible values, make sensible decisions, install Governments that would share our views and then make sure those Governments supported those values?If we don't actively all meet our responsibility to personally do what we can and pressure the Administrations to do the same on our behalves we are guilty and deserve the inevitable, sadly any future generations will only be guilty of being born to irresponsible, apathetic, short sighted, self centred people-Us!!CheersLloyd	5.0	This is serious Mum!!!	2007-05-01	10	5	5

Especially when I'm only given graphs and photographs to look at, and the occassional pan over to a dis-interested audience member in the lecture hall.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1TK1MI5KY9YVJ	Lyle Morgan	This is a solid, carefully constructed presentation by Mr. Gore of the global warming issues. The selections from his lectures, interspersed with related snippets from his career, make for a strong visual presentation of his message. Perhaps his greatest accomplishment is to convey the serious scientific realities in language and visual aids that are understandable and important to the general audience. I was also impressed by the events from his past that helped form his commitment to this cause. It appears that Mr. Gore was disappointed with the lack of progress in this area during his political career, but this sense of loss now fuels his post-political activism. It's really an excellent presentation, a work that should stand as a classic as well as being immediately relevant.	5.0	Graphic, Compelling Vision of Global Warming	2007-01-09	8	6	2

It is full of political ideas that mar the ultimate message. Journalist Ronald Bailey argued in the libertarian magazine Reason that although ""Gore gets [the science] more right than wrong,"" he exaggerates the risks. Since the issue of climate change is such a controversial topic, it is best explored elsewhere because Gore himself has been criticized for his excess greenhouse gas emissions. In 2007, it was widely reported that Al Gore's mansion had a utility bill about 20 times more than the average family home. He also sold his Current TV network to Al Jazeera for $500 million. Naturally, the problem is that Al Jazeera is funded by Qatar, which receives the bulk of its wealth from fossil fuels. However, Gore sees no contradiction in his message and his own personal actions. He's not following the rules he set out but doesn't mind telling you to unscrew light bulbs. During the film's end credits, viewers get messages to combat climate change, including ""recycle"", ""speak up in your community"", ""try to buy a hybrid vehicle"" and ""encourage everyone you know to watch this movie.""Special Features: Commentary by director Davis Guggenheim, Commentary by producers Laurie David, Lawrence Bender, Scott Z.

If man and his machines are truly the cause of today's global warming, then who was responsible for the previous times in earth's history for the cycles of warming and cooling?  How do these same so called experts explain the warming caused by undersea volcanoes and increased solar radiation?  As long as earth has existed, it has gone through cycles of heating and cooling, and most of it before man, aerosols, and SUV's were ever around.  Yes, take care of the earth, but a life without technology is foolish, if not impossible.

I'm a conservative republican and never thought I would side with Al Gore on ANY issue.  Yes, I'm one of those ""right-wingers"", love Fox news, Bill O'Reilly and Ann Coulter.  But as a scientist, specifically a chemist, this movie explains in layman's terms the Science of global warming.  I was most impressed.  Yes, he talks negatively about the current Administration, the loss of the 2000 election, as well as personal matters, but this is done to explain his story about how he's trying to change other people's perceptions.  Get over political party affiliations and look at the science!This video goes through the basic science of global warming.  He also explains what has happened in the past and makes a persuasive prediction for the future.  Mr. Gore demonstrates the cause and effect of altering our atmosphere by changing weather patterns and ocean currents.  I experienced 7 of the 10 typhoons that hit Japan in 2004 that Al talks about in the film...that wasn't fun.  He provides ways to improve our situation, one person and household at a time.  The one thing he doesn't explain is the effect of the massive human population explosion.  We are our worst enemy by consuming so many resources.  Look in your garbage can after one day to see all the waste and unnecessary packaging.All Americans need to take their own ""political agenda blinders"" off and stop seeing what you just want to see.  We all need to come together and change the course we're on.  Global Warming won't affect us as much as future generations, but some day I don't want my grandson/granddaughter to ask ""Why I didn't do anything to stop it.""If my scientifically challenged 14 year daughter can get something out of it, you can too.  Just put political bias aside for 90 minutes and then conduct your own literature research from credible scientific sources.One reviewer said that this is just ""theory.""  Well, to use an old clich&eacute;', bears excreting in the woods is a theory until you either step in it or see him doing it.  We're ""stepping"" in global warming now.

Smith Jr.	"The real inconvenient truth is that this mockery of a documentary is blatantly skewed towards junk science and political convenience.  It plays on basic human fears that we are not in control of our lives or destiny and therefore have a crisis *now* that threatens our very existence.  It fails to give proper perspective to the whole of the Earth's history but rather plays up recent (and rather spotty) measurements.The doomsday crowd will be overly excited over this release because it validates their paranoia.  Be very wary of Kyoto Accord code-speak as it presents a single sided argument.  Why, how can anyone disagree with clean air and water - that's inhuman.  Of course it is, and nobody ever said they were in favor of dirty water and air.  The questions is how reliable are the facts and motives of those giving the ""facts"" versus the economic cost of taking extreme action that isn't even proven needed yet.  This piece of fiction sets up it's own skewed questions before giving a predictable answer.  That's like having the students make up the questions then provide the answers.This really must the the most lopsided presentation of ""facts"" I have ever seen, and I nearly fell for it before doing the most basic regiment of research on my own.  The only thing you should really fear is how unscrupulous the producers are and how gullible the sycophants are.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3V7Q7NXJLANFL	Matthew A. Bille	"Having finally gotten around to seeing Al Gore's global warming film, I came away thinking it is being overpraised.This being a film, the science had to be simplified due to time constraints. That's always true. But Gore simplifies by ignoring important points. To him, all recent warming of the Earth is human-caused. No time is spent on the important issue of how much of the measured warming can definitely be ascribed to human actions and how much is normal long-term change expected for a planet in an interglacial warm period.The visual effects are mostly effective, even if some (like the drowning of Manhattan) illustrate ""worst case"" scenarios that Gore presents as likely, if not certain. Gore blames Hurricane Katrina on human-caused warming, which is hardly established fact. (If he is going to use the bad hurricane year of 2005 as evidence of long-term change, one wonders what he has to say now about very weak 2006 season.)  In a litany of side effects of warming, he includes the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis. (Huh?)While Gore mainly points the finger at the U.S., he does a good job of making it clear the situation is global by spending some time on the contribution to greenhouse gases made by China's rapid population and economic expansion.At one point, Gore throws out a very important statement that needs support. He says that if we ""do the right thing"" (changing energy technologies, ending greenhouse gas emissions) we will ""create new wealth and jobs."" That may be true, but it requires explanation, especially when not a word is said about the technical and economic challenges involved in changing over from fossil to renewable energy. (I agree we have to make a major start on this, and quickly, but it will not be easy or cheap, and Gore should be upfront about that.)As a movie, the film meanders. Detours on Gore's personal life and political experiences make the viewer suspect this is a bit of a campaign commercial as well as an environmental film. There are bits that don't make sense (the weird Simpson-ish animation near the beginning, for example) and could have been replaced with more scientific information.Overall, Gore set out to make a point here, and he generally does it well. He's become more relaxed and engaging than he was as a candidate, although my 10-year-old (who watched with me for a school assignment) still compared him to a ""really boring teacher."" Still, there is too much oversimplification and overstatement involved in driving the point home. Gore leaves himself open to criticism, some of it accurate, that could have been avoided if the film spent more time on the science of the core subject and less on everything from Gore family farm to non-warming-related extinctions.So see the film, but don't take it as the whole story of a complex subject."	3.0	"Oversimplified and not always accurate ""truth"""	2006-12-30	19	10	9

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2R6RA8FRBS608	Matthew G. Sherwin	"An Inconvenient Truth allows Al Gore to push his theory that global warming is real and potentially very hazardous to the human race, wildlife and all nature. He is correct; and he supplies us with charts, graphs, scientific data and anecdotal self-revealing tales in order to get his point across.Although there are several times when the movie and Al Gore's slideshow are so full of dry scientific data and lingo it could make a man fall asleep while trying to watch it, there are also much more substantive moments when Al Gore relates the wealth of scientific data to the real people in his life. We see how tobacco brought on the death of his big sister and he connects tobacco smoke to the pollution we put into Earth's atmosphere every day as a type of cancer smoke we all gradually breathe more and more frequently. Gore sometimes jokes with his audience even though the subject matter is, of course, no laughing matter.However, even if your attention does drift a few moments here and there (just don't tell people you sometimes felt bored), you still get the message loud and clear: global warming is something we cause by pollution--and it's also something we can fix in order to avert a serious climate crisis within the next fifty years. Perhaps the most dramatic graphics Gore uses are those of what would happen to highly populated areas including New York City and Beijing if too much ice melted from warming and became water--huge areas of major cities would be underwater.The DVD comes with several extras. We get two commentaries with directors and others and Al Gore himself gives a roughly thirty minute ""update"" on what events have taken place since this movie was first made for the big screen. Unfortunately, Mr. Gore has much more sobering data to support his claim that global warming must be stopped at once. I also liked the eleven minute featurette on how they made An Inconvenient Truth.The quality of the picture and sound is excellent. They did an excellent job of editing the footage, too; this becomes more apparent when you watch the featurette on the making of this movie.Overall, Al Gore makes a strong case for global warming and the urgent need for us to change our ways in his fine movie entitled An Inconvenient Truth. I highly recommend this film for people studying global warming; and if you ever needed motivation and spirit to change the ways you use energy this movie sure will influence you!Four stars."	4.0	a solid case for global warming and the need to fix the problem now	2007-11-19	7	4	3

"""An inconvenient truth"", directed by Davis Guggenheim, allows you to watch a lecture about global climate change that Al Gore has given many times, in different parts of the world. Strangely enough, it is not boring, and even though the subject is somewhat complicated, Gore manages to make it accessible to the spectator.Al Gore is entertaining and patient with his audience, saying that ""It is just human nature to take time to connect the dots. I know that. But I also know that there can be a day of reckoning when you wish you had connected the dots more quickly"". According to him, climate change and how we react to it is ultimately not a political issue so much as a moral issue. Once you are aware of what is happening, and realize that climate change is not just a ""theory"", you will have to act, because there is just no other option. Either you are part of the problem, or one of those trying to find a solution.I strongly believe that this dvd should be seen by everybody, because it tackles a difficult subject that concerns us all, that is climate change and the way in which it is affecting our planet. Disregarding your political ideas or the place where you live, there are some disturbing facts that you won't be able to deny any longer, even if they lead to an inconvenient truth.In the last few minutes of this movie, Al Gore says that he set himself a goal, to try to communicate clearly what he has learnt about global climate change.

An Inconvenient Truth casts in stark relief the very real plight the human race faces IN OUR LIFETIME! Al Gore is simply the messenger in this story and this message should transcend partisanship. The real story of this film is not Gore but rather the drastic changes in climate in just the last 20 years. Gore articulates from every angle how mother nature is slapping us in the face begging us to wake up. 9/11 was terrible and terrorism should be a serious concern but a real weapon of mass destruction is headed our way that will dwarf the loss of that tragic day. No I'm not going to say that anyone who voted for the Bush administration has unwittingly signed the death warrant of their grandchildren but the Republican Party simply must make radical changes to their environmental platform. I reiterate this is everyone's problem. Al Gore's mission here is to illustrate that we're not talking about the abstract here. This is not something that we will be forced to address 100 years from now. This problem is immediate. Tsunami's, hurricanes, fires and floods are just the beginning. Now as a film An Inconvenient Truth could have been unbearable with it's grim message but Gore offers a ray of hope that change is possible through technology and political will. American's bear the lion's share of this responsibility as our co2 output far surpasses other countries'.

Wood ""Content Writer and Reviewer"""	Former Vice President, Al Gore with the aid of director Davis Guggenheim has delivered an educational and entertaining look at our environment and what we are doing to it. This is an important film that shares the science and the politics behind global warming and how it affects our planet; specifically what has been happening over the last century with a focus on the last 50 years. It also makes a projection for the next 50 years. It is not looking good. The earth is dying and we are the cause.If you watch this film you'll learn how CO2 is killing our planet (70 million tons of CO2 are pumped into the atmosphere every day). You will see footage on the decline of our glaciers, our increasing population, weather disturbances, animal and plant extinctions, an increase in new diseases and most importantly you will learn why it should be important to us. This is definitely an educational film but it's a very important one for our time. And it won't put you to sleep.My only qualm with the film is that it did not spend enough time teaching the viewer enough on what we can do individually and as a society to correct the problem. Fortunately, where the film leaves off, the Climate Crisis website continues.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1KR944KXUE8ZX	M. G. Travis	"What was most surprising to me after seeing An Inconvenient Truth was that the movie was not necessarily a movie about the problem of global warming but a movie about Al Gore's slide show presentation and his effort to inform the world. Through the clips of his presentation the overall message is clear, that if we don't change certain things global warming will have a devastating effect on the world. That is a very important issue that I think should be brought to everyone's attention, at the end of the movie they give a website to find out how you can reduce carbon dioxide emissions and such but this is during the credits. An hour into the film I was thinking to myself that so far the movie had only shown how bad the circumstances of global warming will be, not until maybe the last 15 minutes are any solutions offered. This movie has been promoted as a wake up call of sorts to the nation but after watching it I felt more like it was a look at what Al Gore is doing. This personally doesn't bother me, I enjoyed it throughly, however I think many people would be turned away from the movie just because it is so political and not just scientific. There are several instances Vice President Gore jokes about how he was supposed to be president and takes shots at the current administration which unfortunately may turn away some people. I just felt like if this is such an important issue why not make the information available to the largest group of people possible? Instead of running it in limited release where the average person has to seek the movie out why not air it on at least a cable station?Politics aside the movie does what it does very well. It explains about Gore's past and explains why he is so passionate about his cause. The movie does provide lots of eye opening information on what global warming is doing and what may happen but manages to still be light hearted too. At one point when he is showing a graph the line of data went so high that he got on a crane device to reach it which added humor to a serious topic. There was an animated clip shown which I recognized the animation as looking like ""The Simpson's"" and found out it actually was from the creator of that show's other series ""Futurama"". These type of things kept the film from feeling too serious. Some things were brought up that I think they should have gone more into if they were going to scratch the surface, specifically conspiracy theory type claims that the Bush administration has altered or kept information from the public about global warming. The few things that were shown were convincing and if they are true they deserve a movie about them on their own."	4.0	An Inconvenient Truth	2006-10-28	21	11	10

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2QVGELFE9LL41	"Michael A. Scheurich ""The Professor"""	"You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can not fool all of the people all of the time."" ---  Abraham LincolnBut You CAN  fool enough of the people enough of the time. And Al Gore's Unconvenient Truth is a perfect example of this.1,500 years ago science was set back a thousand years when religion outlawed scientific knowledge and in today's world scientific knowledge is being set back again by politicians like Al Gore. If a scientist goes along with the global warming hoax his career and government grants will sour and become rich and famous but don't go along with it and their  careers will be destroyed and their funding for their work well be cut off. In addition the real experts in the field are too busy doing their 24/7 job to debunk Al Gore's political scare tactics used in Inconvenient Truth.His film is 90% smoke and mirrors and 10%  misrepresentation of scientific data. He starts out showing pictures from space of earth with long dialogues depicting himself as some kind of representative of science with many scientist friends he allegedly has known since childhood. A side view of earth showing the thin layer of the atmosphere is suppose to make people think that it is a fragile thin layer we can destroy easily. but if we were to look at a close up view we would see a 65 mile high layer composed of the troposphere, Stratosphere, mesosphere and thermosphere. On the other hand its human  life that are a thin two-dimensional  layer on the earths's surface only covering 29% of the earths surface and in the ocean which is at the most 2 miles deep covering 71% of the earths surface. His cartoon of a little girls ice creeam cone melting is not compelling evidence.The so called conveyor belt of global warming alarmists must have been dreamed up by TV weathermen. Translating their knowledge of atmospheric conveyor belt knowledge to the ocean does not quite explain the theory. Maybe they should leave oceanology to oceanologists and stick to climatology or take some basic physics courses on fluid dynamics. As far as the atmosphere is concerned  air can be heated by land that has been heated by the sun and thus rise displacing any cold air above it. It can then be cooled as it travels to another area where it may condense, sink, and  displace the air below it. But  the ocean floor is not heated by the sun and therefore cold sea water on the bottom cannot heat up, expand and rise to the surface. Supposedly the warm water now heated travels north on the surface loosing heat to the atmosphere on the way to the north and become more dense than the colder sea water below it. The key factors to look at is the density of the water and it salinity (salt content).The saltier the water  the more dense it is. Also the colder the water is the more dense it is. That is unless it is frozen as frozen water expands and becomes less dense. So global warming experts?  would have us believe that lighter  water on the surface of the ocean somehow magically becomes more dense than the colder salty water below it and sink. Sorry everyone but maybe someone can explain that one to me. Oh yeah, according to politicians who have a better understanding than scientist its true  because they  said it is true. After all, have politicians ever lied to the public? Naw, can't ever imagine that ever happening. In addition Gore tries to imply that the melting of ice on water will cause a rise in seas level. Not so. First of all when ice over water melts it has no effect on the level of the ocean.(try putting ice cubes in a glass of water and melt it) In addition frozen water takes up more volume than its liquid form so shrinks. On top of that the ice is formed from precipitation and contains no salt so is less dense than the salt water below it and does not sink when it does melt.Apparently Al Gore is helping big oil and the 5 major automobile companies is in diverting attention towards harmless gas (CO2) and away from harmful gases (NOx, SOx, CO, and other pollution from automobile emissions causing  air pollution. Why? Its impossible to solve the NOX problem.. In improving the combustion of carbon based fuels in internal combustion engines an increase in NOX is unavoidable. Incomplete combusted carbon based fuels are carcenogens.When we increase the combustion of CO and gasoline  components we reduce the amount of dangerous hydrocarbons but we increase the amount of acid rain causing compounds. These gases (NOX and SOX) are not harmless. Nitrogen oxides, or NOx, is the generic term for a group of highly reactive gases, all of which contain nitrogen and oxygen in varying amounts. Many of the nitrogen oxides are colorless and odorless. However, one common pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) along with particles in the air can often be seen as a reddish-brown layer over many urban areas.Nitrogen oxides form when fuel is burned at high temperatures, as in a combustion process. The primary manmade sources of NOx are motor vehicles, electric utilities, and other industrial, commercial, and residential sources that burn fuels.A variety of Federal and State regulatory initiatives are aimed at reducing nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from electricity generators. NOx emissions are a concern because they contribute to the formation of acid rain and, either directly or through the creation of ozone, lead to harmful effects on human health. It has been determined that the combustion of fossil fuels is the major source of NOx emissions. According to estimates made by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), highway vehicles accounted for 35 percent of the 22 million tons of NOx emissions in the United States in 1995, and electric utilities accounted for 29 percent.To address this issue, electric utilities began complying in 1996 with the first phase of the acid deposition control regulations established by the EPA under Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA90). This first phase places limits on NOx emissions from 239 older coal-fired generating units. Overall, the utilities that operate the affected units achieved a 40-percent reduction in the emissions rates of the units and a total reduction of approximately 340,000 tons of NOx emissions in 1996 from their 1990 levels. In most cases, the units were retrofitted with low-NOx burners that control fuel and air mixing to limit NOx formation. Potential lawsuits for cancer and other illnesses from fossil fuels would cost the Oil Companies billions of dollars if the Oil Companies weren't able to show that similar compounds can also be found in trace amounts in cigarettes . When it was shown that nonsmokers have just as high illnesses and smokers the Oil Companies paid the ACS millions in contributions to do more studies to show second hand smoke was the cause. now that defense is weakening a new ploy is being used to divert attention from its pollutants--Global Warming.  Carbon Dioxide is completely harmless to animal and plant life so makes a good diversion from the real problems of fossil fuel uses.Much is not known about causes of modern diseases such as cancer, Parkinson and Alzheimer as well as countless other wide spread afflictions. The industrial spy network is widespread and powerful and look for potential trouble makers such as environmentalist and silence them before they actually conduct meaningful studies.BTW oil is considered a national security product and anyone threatening the production of oil products is subject to CIA and FBI scrutiny and possible silencing. Government employees face prison  if they achieve whistle blowing status.Al Gore claims no connection to Big Oil yet Gore senior first met long-time Occidental Oil CEO Armand Hammer at a cattle auction in the 1940s. When zinc ore was discovered on some of Gore's land, Hammer and Oxy bought it for twice the amount of the only other bid. Hammer then sold the land back to Gore while retaining the mineral rights. The elder Gore then sold the land to his son, Al Jr., who has received $20,000 yearly in mineral royalties from Occidental ever since. Two years after Gore Sr. was defeated in a bid for re-election to the Senate, he joined Occidental as a member of its board of directors and was rewarded with a $500,000 a year job working for an Oxy subsidiary.Throughout his political life, Al Gore Jr. has received the favor the patronage of Occidental Oil and Hammer's successor, CEO Ray Irani. And for every campaign finance violation Gore has committed, Irani seems to be lurking in the background. He was one of the contributors who slept in the Lincoln bedroom (a couple days later Irani wrote a $100,000 check to the DNC). When Al Gore made illegal fundraising calls from the White House, Irani was one of the recipients (he ponied up $50,000, according to a Harold Ickes memo unearthed during the investigation). In the Elk Hills sell-off , Irani and Oxy finally got the payoff worthy of their long patronage. It is a payoff crooked businessmen have dreamed of ever since the land was stripped from the Kitanemuks during the Gold Rush. Indeed, the history of Elk Hills and corruption is an old one. And it is a story most Americans have heard.In conclusion if you want a big laugh get this movie but if you have a weak stomach avoid it at all costs."	1.0	Convienent Lie	2007-11-27	24	8	16

We have got to start approaching this problem with common sense, science, and a desire to MAKE change happen; instead of waiting for our leaders to do the right thing.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A37Q80MN9S5AZO	Michael Goonan	"Much has already been said about ""An Inconvenient Truth"".  It's inspiring, it's educational, and it points out a desperate need for change in our society.  For those who do not believe that global warming is a problem, or even those that do believe it is a problem but do not fully understand it, go see this film.  You will then realize what a serious problem this is.A lot has been made about Al Gore being the presentor.  ""Al Gore?  You mean the guy who thinks he invented the internet?"" ... ""Al Gore isn't a scientist!  Why should I take him seriously?""No matter what your view on Al Gore's stance on other political issues, or of him as a credible souce of scientific information, he is very passionate about this issue and is a very intellegent and pursuasive speaker.  Give him a chance before you write him off as an enviornmental wacko who is trying to scare you into voting Democrat.As far as science is concerned, Al Gore lays no claim to being a scientist...and he doesn't have to.  None of the information presented in the film is his own.  It is data from the world's leading scientists that Gore has thoroughly researched and learned as much as he can about.  He's not making this stuff up for political gain, and no he's not trying to garner support for a presidential run.  Al Gore has seen an issue that he is very concerned with, and it's something that we have all of the tools at our fingertips to fix!  We have just chosen not to.  That's what he wants to change.Lastly, I'd like to point out one of the things I like best about this film and Gore's character:  He has faith in the people.  You would never imagine, with all of the crap he must have thrown at him from deniers, how incredibly confident he is that once the American people and the people of the rest of the world know the truth, they will not only want, but DEMAND change immediately to solve this crisis.Special features include a 25 minute update from Al Gore about advances in the science of global warming since the release of An Inconvenient Truth.  This is just great added value on top of an already excellent film.  If you're not one to buy movies you've already seen in the theater's, it's at least worth renting it to watch the update.If you are interested in learing what you individually can do to help stop global warming pollution, log on to the film's website at [...] and click on the ""take action"" tab on the right."	5.0	A Global Warning	2007-03-06	14	9	5
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A15P5S9NSPLVKL	"Michaeliz ""One More View"""	"An Inconvenient Truth does a great job of putting the whole story of global warming and its ramifications in one place--an inspiring 96-minute film.  Moreover, after seeing the film you will understand why this issue is so important to Al Gore--he was inspired by a college professor and has studied the problem for nearly all of his adult life and has championed the need for action all through his political career--which now appears to be incredible foresight given the mounting body of evidence that global warming is having disastrous effects on every continent and every part of our eco-system.We all need to act now, before it is too late!!!  Gore notes the positive steps that we can take that are within our grasp to reduce the levels of carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse gases back to 1970 levels.If you have doubt, as I had, about whether the phenomenon and effects of global warming are as significant as they have been portrayed, this movie will remove that doubt.  It all begins to make sense in this movie how the interrelationships of the changes cause serious consequences everywhere on the earth.  And it has causes I would not have even thought possible. I just noticed a news article today about Bark beetles ravaging western US forests--which scientists attribute to warming climate because the region in recent years has not sustained periods of sub-zero temperatures that once dealt a fatal blow to beetle populations.  After seeing the movie, I really believe it--this is just one of the many phenomena that Gore notes during his lecture in the movie.One other important point that Gore makes is that the scientific community is in agreement about seriousness of the problem.  Politicians and businessmen raising questions about whether there is agreement have a hidden agenda to protect the commercial interests of their constituents and their industries--hence they view global warming as an ""inconvenient truth"" which is in their interests to obfuscate.  In doing so, they have created a general misperception in the media that there is disagreement in the scientific community about whether global warming is a significant problem.This is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen, both because of the topic and the presentation.  Don't wait to see this--it will change your whole perspective."	5.0	A Movie of Serious Consequence...	2006-12-10	28	20	8
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A5ZQ51RAFY81C	MichaelJohn	I don't believe global warming is a proven fact or a hoax, but I do think the truth lies somewhere in between. Unfortunately, it may take decades if not longer to confirm or refute what Al Gore claims are FACTS in this movie.I don't agree with many of the reviews here on Amazon.com that arrogantly state that global warming is fact not theory, and claim we already have IRREFUTABLE scientific data proving its being caused by the burning of fossil fuels. I also don't agree with reviewers that are equally as arrogant, when they dismiss any notion that our climate may be changing, and that humanity may be playing a part. Again, I believe the truth lies between both these extremes of OPINION.Yes, many climate scientists believe that global warming is being caused by the burning of fossil fuels, but a minority of climate scientists dispute these claims. Unfortunately you don't hear their views in this movie, and that's a very good reason for all to be skeptical, if not suspicious about all the so called FACTS in this documentary.It seems the whole subject of global warming has become much too political, with each side holding to their personal bias and unwilling to listen to any dissenting opinions. Missing in this discussion is rational debate, and a willingness from both sides to admit they DON'T have all the answers to this very complex subject. We need much more climate research by the scientific community, and much less biased reporting and heated political rhetoric. I strongly believe that we DON'T have the whole truth or a complete understanding about global warming or climate change, and anyone who thinks we do contradicts prevailing scientific opinion.Regardless if global warming is being caused by man, or is a natural climate cycle that we don't yet understand- we as a country and as individuals can and should be doing ALOT to help clean up our environment. What it will take is a President and a Congress that will inspire and motivate us with a real vision and real goals. It will also take a change in attitude and purchasing habits from the American consumer. With determination, adequate funding for research and established goals for our nation, WE CAN make positive changes that will make our planet healthier and less polluted. Hopefully we can even reverse some of the damage we have already caused.As a nation, we should be doing everything possible to find alternatives to using fossil fuels. Not only because of the possible consequences of global warming, but also because of our increased dependence on Middle East oil and the obvious security implications. Politicians make a lot of speeches about ending our dependence on foreign oil, but in reality we have no true energy policy to accomplish that goal. Talk is cheap!Finding viable alternatives to our fossil fueled economy won't be easy, and most informed Americans realize that there are no quick fixes. It will take a generation or more before alternatives like fuel cells, truly practical electric cars, cellulosic biomass fuels, improved solar power panels etc. are available to drastically reduce our need for fossil fuels. In the meantime, our government should be doing everything possible to accelerate research and development of these new technologies. We also need to give businesses and people incentives to use them.In my opinion, if the Kyoto protocols were implemented by the USA today, the results would be devastating to our economy and result in mass unemployment and incredibly high energy prices. To survive and remain profitable, many US businesses and especially polluting industries would be forced to relocate to countries like China or India that are not affected by Kyoto's emission caps.Don't believe that could happen?  Think about this. In the past fifteen years we have already witnessed the mass outsourcing of US jobs to countries with cheaper labor. Business leaders claim that this was necessary to keep them competitive in an ever increasing global economy. I believe that under current Kyoto emission restrictions, this trend to outsource US jobs and production would increase dramatically.I think it's very important to note that even those countries that are most in favor of the Kyoto protocols have NOT been able to reduce their emissions anywhere near the stated goals of the pact. I will give them credit for trying, but it seems to prove that the goals of Kyoto are quite unrealistic and unworkable. There's also mounting evidence of the damaging economic consequences Europe is beginning to face, as it tries to fully implement Kyoto.Maybe I'm sounding a bit optimistic and a lot like a capitalist, but I think the real solutions to our increasing global pollution problems, as well as our search for alternate energy sources, will only come from countries with robust and growing economies. Only those countries with strong economies will have the resources needed to invest in future research and development.  A shrinking or collapsing US or European economy may actually result in MORE pollution of all kinds, and HIGHER CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions in the long run.If unrealistic emission limits are imposed on the US which damages our economy, then I feel there is little real hope to developing viable energy alternatives to our fossil fueled economy	2.0	No One Knows the Whole Truth...Yet	2007-02-07	11	5	6

This is very entertaining, without trivializing an important issue.  The second surprise is that Al Gore can project a personality.  That may not surprise everyone, and indeed given his dry delivery and even drier wit, some might still take issue with the contention that he can be more than a stuffed shirt.  But this is effort that can hold the attention of even casual viewers, and that alone makes it an important movie.  If you saw An Inconvenient Truth in the theater, you'll be pleased to note that some of the content has been updated for the DVD release.Al Gore's credentials as a tree-hugging environmentalist (and I say that with the utmost of respect) are unchallenged.  So you might be excused for expecting an overly alarmist approach to this presentation of what greenhouse gasses and global warming are doing to our planet.  But the numbers are scary enough as is.  These are data that have been well documented and carefully analyzed to present a clear picture of an issue that is being distorted by various special interests and political segments.  You can argue the validity of the scientists' projections, but you can't deny the historical numbers, and those numbers suggest that we are on a very, very disturbing road.Don't believe the numbers?  How about some comparison photos (taken within our lifetimes) that show the receding snow cap of Mount Kilimanjaro receding; photos of glaciers in Europe and elsewhere that have almost disappeared and threaten to do so within just a few years.In 2003, Senator James Inhofe posited that ""man-made global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.""

It's a real movie- way beyond a stiff documentary.  And the science in this film is rock solid- none of these facts are being debated; these are all well accepted, even by the Bush administration (see ""Our Changing Planet"" from the President's Budget for FY 2006 by the Climate Change Science program) who continues to refuse to take real action.Some have criticized the film as being short on solutions.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A8U39G9OX88SH	Michael P. Frank	"The point of watching this movie is to begin to familiarize oneself with some of the most basic scientific facts behind the impending global environmental crisis, which is by far the gravest danger that humankind has ever faced.Even beyond the more immediately obvious consequences of storms and droughts, rising sea levels and ecosystem disruption, a recent Scientific American article (Oct. 2006) points out compelling evidence that several of the Earth's past mass extinction events (including ones that destroyed >95% of all species) were caused when high CO2 levels from ancient volcanoes resulted in extensive acidification, deoxegenation and heating of the oceans, killing most marine species, and causing a build-up in the oceans of toxic gases produced by anaerobic bacteria, gases which then upwelled into the air in large plumes, killing most land animals as well.If present trends continue, we could be faced with CO2 levels comparable to those that apparently caused these past mass exinction events by near the end of this century.  Even today, we are already beginning to see increasing numbers of deoxygenated ""dead zones"" in the ocean, produced by some of the same effects, which are already beginning to kill shoreline animals via red tides and so forth.  As CO2 levels triple over the next century, as they will if we bury our heads in the sand with a ""business as usual"" approach, the possibility of these dead zones growing into another world-wide mass extinction event, this time caused by our own negligence, becomes frighteningly plausible.  If this happens, we cannot just blindly assume that humanity will be among the small percentage of species that will be lucky enough to survive the environmental cataclysm.  Thus, taking steps TODAY to begin to normalize CO2 levels could be essential for the survival of humankind beyond the coming century.So, if you don't want your grandchildren and great-grandchildren to wind up choked to death by poisonous gases spewing out of dead oceans, then PLEASE, see this movie, get to know the science behind it (which is thoroughly documented in numerous high-quality, peer-reviewed scientific journals), and then TAKE ACTION - for, changing the world begins with our individual and collective political will."	5.0	By far, the most important film of our time	2006-12-28	15	9	6

If anything needs to be free of politics it's science.  There are plenty of scientists that disagree with the conclusions Al Gore has made and they are being viciously attacked and losing their jobs.Both the Earth and Mars are currently experiencing warming.  You don't have to be a scientist to figure out that there are no humans on Mars so the warming must be natural.  The earth's climate has ALWAYS been changing and goes through warming and cooling periods naturally. Most of the warming during this cycle started way before 1940 before the industrial revolution.  In fact from about 1940-1980 the hype was about Global COOLING and the fear was that we were headed for another ice age!

The unfortunate reality here is that the mock-u-mentary's real title should have been ""An Incomplete Truth"" due to the ""fact"" that 1) Science is NOT a consensus issue as Mr. Gore has purported, and 2) The BBC has recently aired a much more fair depiction of what Mr. Gore has overtly politicized.Only 30 years ago the environmentalist movement worldwide was warning of the ""coming Ice Age"". Oops. Bad prediction based on bad politics. That is, politics based on its agenda that required propoganda over true facts. Now they are predicting the extreme OPPOSITE: global warming!!!There was a day in which we had learned NOT to blindly trust our politicians. Now it seems like college students and most people who worship at the altar of Hollywood and the Democrat Party refuse to admit that they've lost the ability to discriminate. That is, if they even know what the true meaning of that word means. Like the children of the Pied Piper, they simply walk off the cliff of ""if I saw it on T.V., it must be true"". Access Hollywood, The View, The Tonight Show, all have cheerleaders pushing one agenda and afraid...no, unable to entertain another view lest it weaken their political elitism...""we know better than the average guy, so he better do as we tell him"".Don't forget the ""not as I do"" as in the case of Mr. Gore's whopping energy use - and his weak attempt at justifying his usage by ""buying carbon footprints"" which amount to little more than a bunch of trees that will require 20 years of growth to compensate for 1 month of his power usage). Sheesh! Mr. Gore, your hypocracy is killing us and making your acceptance of accolades for this film a bit embarrasing for you. We're not all puppets. But I guess there's enough of 'em out there to keep you feelin' good about yourself and in the public spotlight...for better or for worse.Don't get me wrong: Mr. Gore, I respect your work in government (I think), but why do you still refuse (as of March 2007) to have your claims discussed with those scientists and researchers who differ with you? That's what makes this movie's claims appear so weak. Does anyone know why ""tempered steel"" can withstand so much pressure? Because it has withstood the heat.Sorry, maybe this is a bit over the heads of his fans, but I would only ask that those who read this have an open mind and don't just believe everything the politician tells you. You'll be better off for it...and a bit more intelligent!

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3FNOA4ZZ86K9G	Minnesota Mouse	This is not a political movie, it is a dire warning of what is to come if things don't change. We as U.S. citizens are the biggest contributors to the problems in the environment.We need to be the leaders in the world and step up to our responsiblities and not remain in denial. We did it for the ozone layer, water pollution, cigarette smoking, etc. We can do it again but we all have to make some sacrifices. We can be as one and accomplish so much or we can remain in denial until there is no looking back. Think of Katrina on the grandest scale we have ever seen.This movie is really worth seeing.  I think the last year is a strong indication of what is happening.  The ice shelf in the North Pole collapsing, South Dakota at 120 degrees (I was there!), rain in Minnesota on New Year's Eve..... none of this is normal.  Those who say this is cyclical are truly in denial and those who think this is political need to think twice.I feel a responsiblity to those that come after me.  Previous generations felt that responsibility which is why we have National Parks, protected species, etc.  This is the responsibility of our generation and we cannot take it lightly.  We did not create all of it but we need to deal with it. I hope we're not too late.	5.0	Everyone should see this	2007-01-03	7	4	3
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"""An Inconvenient Truth"" presents former Vice President Al Gore's lecture on global warming (minus about half an hour) that he has trotted all over the world in hopes of raising awareness about the impact of man-made pollutants on climate change. Al Gore has given this presentation more than 1000 times, using a PowerPoint slide show from his laptop, but this time he is in a large lecture hall built on a sound stage for this film, with his many photos and graphs displayed on an enormous screen. It's difficult to make a lecture compelling on film, and director Davis Guggenheim almost succeeds by cutting the lecture with footage and commentary outside of the lecture hall, in which Gore talks about the people and events that inspired him to environmental activism. Gore comes across as geeky, but, contrary to what one might expect, he is not wooden or dull. It's clear that Al Gore is passionate about his 30-year crusade to combat global warming. If he had been this passionate about the 2000 presidential campaign, he would have been President.The concept behind global warming is that ""greenhouse gasses"" thicken our atmosphere, trapping more IR light around the earth, which increases our air and water temperatures. After this brief explanation, aided by lots of huge graphs and charts, Al Gore sets about convincing his audience that this will have dire consequences for our planet if we don't act quickly to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. His concerns fall into the categories of either melting ice or meteorological phenomena. They include flooding, hurricanes, heavy rains, drought, melting glaciers, diminishing ice caps, and rising sea levels, as well as the economic and social problems that these things may precipitate. Al Gore's big charts are pretty interesting if you like numbers, and they include air temperature and carbon dioxide data going back an amazing 650,000 years. He makes his points succinct and easy to understand using photos, maps, and even animation to illustrate abstract concepts.That's the good part. I don't think that ""An Inconvenient Truth"" makes a strong case for impending catastrophe. One problem is that Al Gore often fails to tell us why we should care. What do these alleged symptoms of global warming mean to us? I was also left unconvinced of a relationship between recent meteorological phenomena and global warming, because the statistics used to support them had glaring omissions and gaps in logic. For example, historical carbon dioxide levels and air temperatures mirror one another, but the current temperatures are not similarly proportional to current carbon dioxide levels. When he claims that air temperatures are increasing globally, he uses year-to-year averages instead of year-to-year temperatures by month. This may produce a different picture -at least for the Northeast, where I live. When he mentions the emergence of new diseases in the past 30 years, he tries to link global warming to SARS and avian flu, which have nothing to do with climate. I could go on.Don't get me wrong. I would like nothing better than to reduce air pollution. It damages people's health. There is no denying that glaciers are melting all over the world or that we are losing chunks of the Arctic and Antarctica. If Al Gore's predictions for the Earth's ice are borne out, it will mean enormous economic upheaval, threatening social and political stability over much of the globe. The melting glaciers and poles are the best-supported and most compelling material in the film. I sympathize with Al Gore's frustration when he says ""we have everything we need"" to solve this problem ""save, perhaps, political will."" But I think that ""An Inconvenient Truth"" inadvertently illustrates why global warming is controversial. The fact that the Earth is warming is not in dispute, but its consequences are very much so.The DVD (Paramount 2006): Bonus features include an update, a ""making-of"" documentary, 2 audio commentaries, and a music video for Melissa Etheridge's ""I Need to Wake Up"" (3  min). If you liked the movie, watch ""An Update with Former Vice President Al Gore"" (32 min). Gore presents new data for various phenomena, including ocean acidification and soil moisture evaporation, which were not mentioned in eh film. ""The Making of An Inconvenient Truth"" (11 min) is an unnarrated look at the construction of the lecture hall in the movie. The first audio commentary is by director Davis Guggenheim. He talks about the challenge of making a lecture interesting on film, some technical issues, specifies the locations that we see, discusses the film's multiple formats, and more. The second audio commentary is with producers Laurie David, Lawrence Bender, Scott Burns, and Lesley Chilcott. They talk about the background of the project and putting it together, technical issues, and editing. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, French."	4.0	Al Gore's Passion.

The main thing though, NEVER LISTEN TO A POLITICIAN LECTURE YOU ABOUT ECOLOGY, OR IF YOU DO, DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU HEAR.Personally, I think making this movie about global warming was just an excuse for Al Gore to lash out at President Bush's politics.  That's all you hear throughout the movie, ""Bush isn't doing this"", ""Today, your government isn't doing that""...An example : That little 3 minute digression on the 2000 elections and how he lost because of Florida...hum hum...I'm sorry, what does that have to do with Global Warming?  I thought it was hypocritical on his part, seeing as he WAS Vice-President and all and did he seriously care about global warming then when he had the power to do something about it? I'd also bet anything that if he were in office instead of G.W.Bush, global warming wouldn't exactly be his top priority either.I was also perplexed at the passage where he explains to us unintelligent members of society that tobacco industries are vewy vewy bad because they're selling products that kill people...and unless the actual smoke that's being produced by smoking is causing the earth's C02 levels to rise, I don't see what that has to do with the subject either.I also could have done without all the little passages about his life...I felt like I was watching his biography, which again has nothing to do with global warming.  I don't see how his son being hit by a car and almost dying has changed our climate.What's interesting about those passages is that they always come after he's just thrown a theory or ""facts"" at you that don't always quite add up or there isn't exactly a solid foundation or correlation between them, so that way you don't have the time to really notice or question anything he says.  For example, when he talks about hurricanes, he says that the hotter the ocean water, the bigger the hurricane...and explains that Katrina got bigger coming into the Gulf of Mexico...and CUT to Al Gore walking in an aiport. I'm sorry? what was that? ok...yes...I don't see what that has to do with global warming, care to connect the dots?  It's common sense to conclude that Katrina did indeed get bigger because the Gulf of Mexico has extremely warm water...ok, but he doesn't tie it to the subject at hand.Also, he throws facts in your face and jumps to the next point so fast you don't have time to ask yourself questions about the information he just gave : ""just eat it right up, don't question anything, and move on along"".  And just to make sure anyone would dare question anything Al Gore says in his movie, let's add another scene of him walking in the airport just to get your mind off of everything.  It's complete, shameless soft-core brainwashing.For example the stats about scientists all agreeing on global warming and it's causes...he took a smidgen of scientists, and then said that none disagreed. Hum Hum... go back 5 seconds when he talks about that 10 percent..he was manipulating information all over the place for that matter, and at times contradicted himself talking about the adapation of animals to warm waters, for example.Now what interests me though is the lack of reference to other planets in our solar system, especially Mars...Doesn't Mars have glaciers?  What happened to that? Isn't there evidence of there having been oceans or something like that? huh...what happened? Global warming? I doubt humans had something to do with it...so what does that tell us?While Global Warming is an important issue and we certainly do have something to do with the rapidity of the process, if you want serious facts and the actual truth for a change, this isn't the movie for you.

Power	"Albeit Gore could address everything for there are many supporting issues that have been culminating to bring this whole sound picture to light. Not to mention how his person/delivery may get in the way for others to be able to hear his message. Understood, but that's sad. People don't throw out the Baby with the Bath water! Literally everyday now more things are comming to light that only further reinstate these views and understandings.Here are some common myths and Facts on the subject from my fact finding I have found immutable...MYTH: The science of global warming is too uncertain to act on.FACT: There is no debate among scientists about the basic facts of global warming.The most respected scientific organizations have stated unequivocally that global warming is happening, and people are causing it by burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences, which in 2005 the White House called ""the gold standard of objective scientific assessment,"" issued a joint statement with 10 other National Academies of Science saying ""the scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action. It is vital that all nations identify cost-effective steps that they can take now, to contribute to substantial and long-term reduction in net global greenhouse gas emissions."" (Joint Statement of Science Academies: Global Response to Climate Change [PDF], 2005)The only debate in the science community about global warming is about how much and how fast warming will continue as a result of heat-trapping emissions. In the case of global warming, scientists have given a clear warning, and we have more than enough facts to act on.MYTH: Global warming is just part of one of the earth's natural cycles.FACT: The global warming we are experiencing is not natural. People are causing it by burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests. Scientists have shown that these activities are pumping far more carbon dioxide (C02) into the atmosphere than was ever released in hundreds of thousands of years. This buildup of CO2 is the biggest cause of global warming. (IPCC 2001) Since 1895, scientists have known that CO2 and other greenhouse gases trap heat and warm the earth. As the warming has intensified over the past three decades, scientific scrutiny has increased along with it. Scientists have considered and ruled out other natural explanations such as sunlight, volcanic eruptions and cosmic rays. (IPCC 2001)Though natural amounts of CO2 vary from 180 to 300 parts per million (ppm), today's CO2 levels are around 380 ppm. That's 25% more than the highest natural levels, looking back 650,000 years. Increased CO2 levels have corresponded with higher average temperatures throughout that long record. (Boden, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center)MYTH: As the ozone hole shrinks, global warming will no longer be a problem.FACT: Global warming and the ozone hole are different problems. The ozone hole is a thinning of the stratosphere's ozone layer, which is roughly 9 to 31 miles above the earth's surface. The depletion of the ozone is due to man-made chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). A thinner ozone layer lets more harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation to reach the earth's surface.Global warming, on the other hand, is the increase in the earth's average temperature due to the buildup of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human activities.MYTH: We can adapt to climate change--civilization has survived droughts and ice ages before.FACT: Individual civilizations have collapsed from dramatic climatic shifts.Although humans as a whole have survived the vagaries of drought, ice ages and more, not every society has. What's more, unless we limit the amount of heat-trapping gases we are putting into the atmosphere, we will face a warming trend unseen since human civilization began 10,000 years ago. (IPCC 2001) The consequences of continued warming at current rates are likely to be dire. Many densely populated areas, such as low-lying coastal regions, are highly vulnerable to climate shifts. A middle-of-the-range projection is that the homes of 13 to 88 million people around the world would be flooded by the sea each year in the 2080s. Poorer countries and small island nations will have the hardest time adapting. (McLean et al. 2001) In what appears to be the first forced move resulting from climate change, 100 residents of Tegua island in the Pacific Ocean were evacuated by the government because rising sea levels were flooding their island. Some 2,000 other islanders plan a similar move to escape rising waters.Scarcity of water and food could lead to major conflicts with broad ripple effects throughout the globe. Even if people find a way to adapt, the wildlife and plants on which we depend may be unable to adapt to rapid climate change. While the world itself will not end, the world as we know it may disappear.MYTH: Even if global warming is a problem, addressing it will hurt American industry and workers.FACT: A well designed trading program will harness American ingenuity to decrease heat-trapping pollution cost-effectively, jumpstarting a new carbon economy.Claims that fighting global warming will cripple the economy and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs are unfounded. In fact, companies that are already reducing their heat-trapping emissions have discovered that cutting pollution can save money. The cost of a comprehensive national greenhouse gas reduction program will depend on the precise emissions targets, the timing for the reductions and the means of implementation. An independent MIT study found that a modest cap-and-trade system would cost less than $20 per household annually and have no negative impact on employment.Experience has shown that properly designed emissions trading programs can reduce compliance costs significantly compared with other regulatory approaches. For example, the U.S. acid rain program reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by more than 30 percent from 1990 levels and cost industry a fraction of what the government originally estimated, according to EPA. Furthermore, a mandatory cap on emissions could spur technological innovation that could create jobs and wealth. Letting global warming continue until we are forced to address it on an emergency basis could disrupt and severely damage our economy. It is far wiser and more cost-effective to act now.MYTH: Water vapor is the most important, abundant greenhouse gas. So if we're going to control a greenhouse gas, why don't we control it instead of carbon dioxide (CO2)?FACT: Although water vapor traps more heat than CO2, because of the relationships among CO2, water vapor and climate, to fight global warming nations must focus on controlling CO2.Atmospheric levels of CO2 are determined by how much coal, natural gas and oil we burn and how many trees we cut down, as well as by natural processes like plant growth. Atmospheric levels of water vapor, on the other hand, cannot be directly controlled by people; rather, they are determined by temperatures. The warmer the atmosphere, the more water vapor it can hold.  As a result, water vapor is part of an amplifying effect. Greenhouse gases like CO2 warm the air, which in turn adds to the stock of water vapor, which in turn traps more heat and accelerates warming. Scientists know this because of satellite measurements documenting a rise in water vapor concentrations as the globe has warmed.The best way to lower temperature and thus reduce water vapor levels is to reduce CO2 emissions.MYTH: Global warming and extra CO2 will actually be beneficial -- they reduce cold-related deaths and stimulate crop growth.FACT: Any beneficial effects will be far outweighed by damage and disruption. Even a warming in just the middle range of scientific projections would have devastating impacts on many sectors of the economy. Rising seas would inundate coastal communities, contaminate water supplies with salt and increase the risk of flooding by storm surge, affecting tens of millions of people globally. Moreover, extreme weather events, including heat waves, droughts and floods, are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity, causing loss of lives and property and throwing agriculture into turmoil.Even though higher levels of CO2 can act as a plant fertilizer under some conditions, scientists now think that the ""CO2 fertilization"" effect on crops has been overstated; in natural ecosystems, the fertilization effect can diminish after a few years as plants acclimate. Furthermore, increased CO2 may benefit undesirable, weedy species more than desirable species.Higher levels of CO2 have already caused ocean acidification, and scientists are warning of potentially devastating effects on marine life and fisheries. Moreover, higher levels of regional ozone (smog), a result of warmer temperatures, could worsen respiratory illnesses. Less developed countries and natural ecosystems may not have the capacity to adapt.The notion that there will be regional ""winners"" and ""losers"" in global warming is based on a world-view from the 1950's. We live in a global community.  Never mind the moral implications -- when an environmental catastrophe creates millions of refugees half-way around the world, Americans are affected.MYTH: Global warming is just part of a natural cycle. The Arctic has warmed up in the past.FACT: The global warming we are experiencing is not natural. People are causing it.People are causing global warming by burning fossil fuels (like oil, coal and natural gas) and cutting down forests. Scientists have shown that these activities are pumping far more CO2 into the atmosphere than was ever released in hundreds of thousands of years. This buildup of CO2 is the biggest cause of global warming. Since 1895, scientists have known that CO2 and other greenhouse gases trap heat and warm the earth. As the warming has intensified over the past three decades, scientific scrutiny has increased along with it. Scientists have considered and ruled out other, natural explanations such as sunlight, volcanic eruptions and cosmic rays. (IPCC 2001)Though natural amounts of CO2 have varied from 180 to 300 parts per million (ppm), today's CO2 levels are around 380 ppm. That's 25% more than the highest natural levels over the past 650,000 years. Increased CO2 levels have contributed to periods of higher average temperatures throughout that long record. (Boden, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center)As for previous Arctic warming, it is true that there were stretches of warm periods over the Arctic earlier in the 20th century. The limited records available for that time period indicate that the warmth did not affect as many areas or persist from year to year as much as the current warmth. But that episode, however warm it was, is not relevant to the issue at hand. Why? For one, a brief regional trend does not discount a longer global phenomenon.We know that the planet has been warming over the past several decades and Arctic ice has been melting persistently. And unlike the earlier periods of Arctic warmth, there is no expectation that the current upward trend in Arctic temperatures will reverse; the rising concentrations of greenhouse gases will prevent that from happening.MYTH: Recent cold winters and cool summers don't feel like global warming to me.FACT: While different pockets of the country have experienced some cold winters here and there, the overall trend is warmer winters.Measurements show that over the last century the Earth's climate has warmed overall, in all seasons, and in most regions. Climate skeptics mislead the public when they claim that the winter of 2003-2004 was the coldest ever in the northeastern United States. That winter was only the 33rd coldest in the region since records began in 1896. Furthermore, a single year of cold weather in one region of the globe is not an indication of a trend in the global climate, which refers to a long-term average over the entire planet.MYTH: Global warming can't be happening because some glaciers and ice sheets are growing, not shrinking.FACT: In most parts of the world, the retreat of glaciers has been dramatic. The best available scientific data indicate that Greenland's massive ice sheet is shrinking.Between 1961 and 1997, the world's glaciers lost 890 cubic miles of ice. The consensus among scientists is that rising air temperatures are the most important factor behind the retreat of glaciers on a global scale over long time periods. Some glaciers in western Norway, Iceland and New Zealand have been expanding during the past few decades. That expansion is a result of regional increases in storm frequency and snowfall rather than colder temperatures -- not at all incompatible with a global warming trend.In Greenland, a NASA satellite that can measure the ice mass over the whole continent has found that although there is variation from month to month, over the longer term, the ice is disappearing. In fact, there are worrisome signs that melting is accelerating: glaciers are moving into the ocean twice as fast as a decade ago, and, over time, more and more glaciers have started to accelerate. What is most alarming is the prediction, based on model calculations and historical evidence, that an approximately 5.4 degree Fahrenheit increase in local Greenland temperatures will lead to irreversible meltdown and a sea-level rise of over 20 feet. Since the Arctic is warming 2-3 times faster than the global average, this tipping point is not far away.The only study that has shown increasing ice mass in Greenland only looked at the interior of the ice sheet, not at the edges where melting occurs. This is actually in line with climate model predictions that global warming would lead to a short-term accumulation of ice in the cold interior due to heavier snowfall. (Similarly, scientists have predicted that Antarctica overall will gain ice in the near future due to heavier snowfall.) The scientists who published the study were careful to point out that their results should not be used to conclude that Greenland's ice mass as a whole is growing. In addition, their data suggested that the accumulation of snow in the middle of the continent is likely to decrease over time as global warming continues.MYTH: Accurate weather predictions a few days in advance are hard to come by. Why on earth should we have confidence in climate projections decades from now?FACT: Climate prediction is fundamentally different from weather prediction, just as climate is different from weather. It is often more difficult to make an accurate weather forecast than a climate prediction. The accuracy of weather forecasting is critically dependent upon being able to exactly and comprehensively characterize the present state of the global atmosphere. Climate prediction relies on other, longer ranging factors. For instance, we might not know if it will be below freezing on a specific December day in New England, but we know from our understanding of the region's climate that the temperatures during the month will generally be low. Similarly, climate tells us that Seattle and London tend to be rainy, Florida and southern California are usually warm, and the Southwest is often dry and hot.Today's climate models can now reproduce the observed global average climates over the past century and beyond. Such findings have reinforced scientist's confidence in the capacity of models to produce reliable projections of future climate. Current climate assessments typically consider the results from a range of models and scenarios for future heat-trapping emissions in order to identify the most likely range for future climatic change.P.S.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AYBL30P5NXNZ4	"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a"""	It is true what everyone has said - this is a compelling and very well told documentary outlining the disaster that is Global warming.  Al Gore definitely knows how to manipulate his audience.  After over a thousand times giving this presentation, it is clear it has been finely honed to deliver a message he is clearly passionate about.Does it stick to the facts and deliver a balanced and scientific message?  Alas, no.The argument is basically this.Man = vastly increased CO2.Vastly increased CO2 = vastly increased temperature.Vastly increased temperature = earth pushed through a series of storms and disasters to an irreversible tipping point, beyond which we cannot save it.There is no doubting man creates more CO2 and this affects the atmosphere in which we live.  The link between CO2 and temperature rise is then shown.. however, leaps in logic are made.  Does temperature rise perhaps increase CO2 and not the other way round? This is not explored.Statistics can be very compelling and very misleading.  Most of Gore's statistics are shown very cleverly but also often without scales and origins, blurring the line from science to propaganda.What about beyond the science, and the movie as a movie?  Well, it is not just the powerpoint presentation it is portrayed as.  It also includes breaks in the data to show Gore's own history with the subject.  This is clearly intended as an emotional manipulation as well as a break in `boring' statistics, but has the effect of bringing a political agenda at odds with what is being said, and I feel detracts from the overall argument.In terms of extras, there is a nice update from Al Gore on some additional data that has come out since the movie was made, in particular some interesting data on the effect on corals.  In addition, for those passionate about the movie, there is a `making of' as well as two commentaries on the movie, and a music video of Melissa Etheridge's Oscar winning song.At the end of the day, this is the most compelling case for conservation of resources seen in popular media by a prominent figure.  I hope everyone sees it and it has an impact on their lifes and habits, as it is too important a subject to ignore.  However, I hope that is viewed with a scientific scepticism that makes people want to find out more about the facts.This movie is in effect a wonderfully effective wake up call - an emotional punch to alert people to the ideas of conservation and the changes happening in our planet.  However, it is not in itself a solution or a definitive answer, it is one sided and errs more on emotion than science.	4.0	An effective wake up call, but not a solution	2007-03-22	12	7	5

The measured gases were carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Concentrations have risen over the last several centuries at a pace far beyond that seen before humans began intensively clearing forests and burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels.  Sampling and analysis were conducted by the European Program for Ice Coring in Antarctica, and the results were published in the journal Science in the Fall of 2005.	5.0	Well presented	2006-12-23	11	5	6

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1QNK348PY8X19	M. Shelton	Go and see this movie, and if you've seen it, simply recommend it. Here's why. This movie, despite reasons, stirs up a lot of passionate controversy. You may not feel that my comment is relevant to this movie, though I say that it is more relevant than any other comment posted, which is why it may not seem so.First of all, the only thing that bothered me, is, why did it take so long to release it world wide? Why is Australia still waiting for the DVD? Maybe the makers had no authority over the marketers.My perspective. Emotions make more sense that logic, yet so many people make little use of this. In school very few understand the nature of probability or the Law of Similars. These are symptoms of decadence. For instance, I have a plant in my room that was ugly and while I try to like all my plants equally, I wanted to remove this plant, even throw it outside so that it could die (I never would of course). A few weeks later, my mum told me that it was not growing properly and needs more sunlight. Makes sense now. Now it has more sun, and my nasty feelings towards it are passing. `Bad' feelings go hand in hand with `bad' situations. This is so true that so many don't realize much of the meaning of it. Emotions are our brains link to the rest of the world. If you want to have your brain so you can survive, and yet be blessed with more room to grow, realizing your emotions is a key.The brain is not responsible for consciousness, it only remembers it.Beyond global warming, there is change ahead. Here is how I see, status quo. You deny the impending destruction, for you do not want to mourn. You are a frustrated fighter for the world, for you have determined your loss. The life around you is wretched, for are battling yourself to see it. You don't know what to do, for you over-simplified the situation. You are angered by the fighters, for your shared loss makes you kin. You taste freedom for short moments, until again you fall behind.I will not sacrifice myself for the system, for I strive to be the system at its best.	5.0	A context for appreciation, not a critique	2006-12-29	10	5	5
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	ATB5WDXUE0DU5	Ms. HJR	"If you haven't seen this movie, you should, and I'm not just recommending* the movie because I like Al Gore and tend to lean toward the left politically. I'm recommending this movie because I care about the environment and there is actual evidence to back up what Al Gore has been saying for years: Global warming does exist.Speaking about global warming is clearly Al Gore's forte. While some of his campaign speeches back in the 2000 Presidential election had been trite and boring, you can tell global warming is a topic Gore sincerely believes in and cares about because he speaks very passionately about the topic.In addition to sharing his extensive knowledge about global warming in ""An Inconvenient Truth"", Gore's very candid about the disappointments and low times in his life; however, he reiterates that he refuses to give into bitterness and despair. Gore's perseverance and determination is something we can all apply to our lives in some way. For example, after the whole voting fiasco in Florida and the Supreme Court's decision in favor of George W. Bush, Gore states: ""That was a hard blow, but what do you do? You make the best of it."" Gore did make the best of the situation and started giving his slide shows about global warming again.Thank God, Gore is persistent and continues to speak out about the global warming crisis. He remarks that he thought this story would be ""compelling enough to get Congress to act"", that it is ""frustrating that people don't understand that we're the worst contributor"" and that he looks for ""meaningful signs we're going to change"" while clip after clip is shown of him being shot down through the years as he has appeared before Congress for hearings on global warming. There's even a clip of George Bush, Sr. remarking, ""This guy wants us up to our necks in owls...this guy is crazy"" while another politician declares ""This is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.""I don't understand how people can say global warming doesn't exist. The signs are everywhere. Carbon dioxide levels are at the highest they have ever been; glaciers all over the world are disappearing; tornadoes, typhoons, floods and hurricanes are rampant and showing up in places where they never have before, and animals and insects, affected by all of the climate changes are migrating to places at unnatural times or dying off because their natural habitat no longer exists.During the closing credits of An Inconvenient Truth, ""I Need to Wake Up"" by Melissa Etheridge -- a really inspiring, motivating song, by the way --plays and different ways we can change the way we live flash across the screen.

I finally got around to watching it last night. Not only is it an engaging, convincing and powerful film, it also didn't leave me in dispair - it left me with hope. Gore not only shows to us laymen irrefutable proof for Climate Change, he shows us that we can still stop this looming catastrophe, this collective crime against humanity and our earth. Time is ticking though. When the ice over the arctic tundras of Canada and later Russia melt, huge amounts of carbon dioxide will be released and Global Warming will basically be put on 'Auto-Pilot'. The time is NOW.P.S. Why on earth did I see the word 'arguably' in the first sentence of the official Amazon review? As in 'the fate of our planet is arguably hanging in the balance'.

This presentation succeeds because it sums up all the information on global warming in an easier to understand format than what might be put out by scientific authority.  The documentary is shocking, sad and most definitely poignant.To the point, I am so tired of hearing ignorant folks, stupidly proclaiming that they see no evidence for severe global change.  People will believe what they are going to believe until all hell comes down on their foolish heads. Most of these ignorant folks also claim to be Christians but throwout and forget at will verses t;hat proclaim that ""when the Lord comes back he will destroy those who have destroyed the Earth,"" and the verses saying that we are suppossed to be stewards for the planet, not to rape and pillage to make a quick buck.  The thing is that there is no excuse for ignorance, except that fact that the US media is not regulated, this happenned in 1988 under former president Reagan, and that most of our news is shockingly unfair and not balanced and tilts drastically to the right.  I saw RFK Jr. give a speech on the environment and the criminal acts at CWU in November of this year and was shocked about some of the things that have happenned during the Bush regime.  This administration is guilty of so much but unfortunately will probably get away clean after leaving office, though a Higher Authority is keeping score.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1DK5AZMXS1QA3	Newton Ooi	Rarely do movies come out that can change people's minds and propel a subject into the political mainstream.  This is one of those movies, and for it to be narrated by Al Gore makes it even more amazing.  The subject of this movie is global warming, and how human behaviors and actions contribute to it.  The movie is based on a slide-show Mr. Gore presents to audiences as he travels around the world, and the video alternates between him presenting his slide-show, and footage of previous events.Mr. Gore presents several points in this movie.  First, he argues that carbon dioxide levels affect the temperature of the Earth's biosphere, that part of our planet that humans live on, plus the oceans and the atmosphere.  To this affect, he shows time charts spanning tens of thousands of years that correlate the level of CO2 in the atmosphere to the average world wide temperature.  He also presents two videos that explain how greenhouse gases such as CO2 act to heat up the Earth.  One video is serious and the other is funny, but both get the point across in a simple but superficial manner.  As a corollary, he states that the Earth's temperature has been steadily rising in the past century, which matches a rise in the CO2 levels in our atmosphere.Second, he shows how scientists measure both the temperature, and the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere for a given time period.  This includes footage of scientists drawing and measuring ice core samples.  Between this  point and the first one, the data shown is impressive, the charts are believable, and the analytical methods used by climatologists are well explained.  But, he does not explain how the data obtained by scientists are used to generate the graphs he presents.  For example, he shows a plot of the Earth's temperature over 65,000 years.  But he does not specify what temperature.  Is it the temperature at the North Pole?  Is it the average oceanic temperature?  How fine is the data; i.e. does he have one data point for each year over the past 65,000 years, or is it one data point per decade.  And what is the scatter in the data?  For example, if his chart shows the temperature in the year 2100 BC is 59 degrees F, is this value an average of 100 values, a mean of 39 values, etc, etc?  I am not saying that Mr. Gore is presenting false data, but I do believe that he should have spent an extra 5 - 10 minutes illustrating the data behind the charts in order to make it more believable for the scientifically literate viewer, and more understandable to the layman.Third, Mr. Gore shows what will happen if atmospheric and oceanic temperatures rise in the amounts predicted by many global warming models.  Specifically, sea levels will rise, ocean currents will change magnitudes and even directions, the location and magnitude of storms such as hurricanes will change, and rainfall patterns will alter around the world.  The effects on human societies will be just as profound.  Many coastal areas will flood, while China and India might get droughts as the Himalayan snows that feed their rivers dry up.  On the other hand, many parts of the world that are now dry will become wetter, thereby increasing the range of mosquitoes and other vectors of tropical and/or waterborne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.  And many fertile areas will cease to be arable.Fourth and most importantly, Mr. Gore compares the problem of global warming with two other problems of recent human memory; the Nazis, and the causation of cancer by smoking.  The latter is personal to Mr. Gore as his family grew up and made a living on a tobacco farm; until his older sister died from lung cancer.  It was this death that convinced the senior Gore to end tobacco farming and Vice President Gore to come out against tobacco cigarettes.  Using both examples, Mr. Gore clearly gets the point across that it is human nature to ignore a problem until it is too late; but this cannot occur with respect to global warming.Fifth, Mr. Gore takes on the critics of global warming by showing two things.  First, he shows how there are thousands of publications on global warming published so far in peer-reviewed journals, which gets the point across that this is a big and well-researched subject.  Second, within a given sample of these publications, not a single one refutes human causation of global warming.  It is this point that is probably most open to contention, and where Mr. Gore could have improved his in-person presentation the most.  Here's how: lets say Mr. Gore is scheduled to speak before an audience of 250 students at university X.  He should come with a stack of 250 different publications from peer-reviewed journals, all of which demonstrate some part of the human causation of global warming. Preferable, Mr. Gore should get review-style articles from several dozen journals.  During the part of his presentation where he states that there is no publication that refutes global warming, he should have his staffers hand out these publications to the audience, one per audience member.  This should take ~5 minutes, meanwhile, he explains that these are some of the publications that support the reality of global warming.  For these 5 minutes, the movie should scroll the names of the same publications across the screen and list each article in the format of article title, authors, journal title and year of publication.  In this way, viewers at home can get some extra reading material, while those watching in person have proof in hand, and can talk to classmates or friends and exchange articles.So all told, the movie is quite good, though there is not enough science.  Also, there is too much Gore.  This DVD comes with multiple extra features.  My favorite one is an update he provides on recent scientific evidence that has come out to support the existence of global warming.	4.0	Too much Al and not enough science	2007-02-18	9	5	4
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ	Nicholas Carroll	"The title is no hype because if we don't change our way of doing things, there won't be a planet to live on. Well, the planet will be here, but humans won't if we continue adding to greenhouse gases, warming the planet beyond what the human body can sustain. This documentary is like a prophetic warning about what might occur if we continue business as usual.When I saw this film in theaters (I even went for a second time, bringing a friend along, and then I went to the actual presentation by President Gore in person), it had the amazing effect of making me finally let go of my anger and outrage over the stolen election of 2000. This film's success proves that there are second acts in politics. While I still believe Gore would have been a great president and we wouldn't be in the mess we're in now if he was allowed to assume the presidency, I think what he's doing as a private citizen is far more important for our world than the mere presidency. He's a true statesman, speaking his passion, with the knowledge he's accumulated during his time in public service.One of the most surprising facts presented in this film is that American automakers cannot sell cars in China because our cars don't meet their auto emissions standards! China is fast becoming the world's largest economy and for our auto companies to be shut out of that market is not helping our big three get out of the red, as they continue to shut down factories and laying off American workers. Yes, there is a better way of doing business. The future of business is green and Europe is well ahead of the game on that. What makes capitalism successful is innovation and competition for the best product at the lowest cost...yet here we have these bloated oil companies who don't want to grab onto new technologies until after the all the oil is consumed. By that point, it will be too late and our economy will suffer. Change needs to begin, like, yesterday!When this film came out, so many reviewers asked where this funny, personable Gore was in 2000. What a wash! Though Gore did play it safe in 2000, he's still the same as he was in 2000. The media has their own amnesia going on, as Bush was the one who faked his way to the oval office. The media preferred to focus on the false scandals of analyzing every statement Gore made and playing it up as ""lies"" (case in point, Gore never claimed to invent the Internet, only that as Senator, he took the initiative in helping to bring the technology about so the private citizen can benefit from what was once a military/national security way of communicating). By their blind scrutiny of one candidate instead of another, it turns out the biggest liar got into the White House while the exaggerator had to find new work.Though I am a huge supporter of Gore and wish he was the president, I'm not sure the success of this film is enough to rightfully bring him to the White House. Cleaning up Bush's mess will be a big part of the next administration and the surplus won't be there to make the kind of changes that a President Gore could have made in 2001-2009. I personally think his role is more important...that of statesmen, bringing this message and prophetic warning about global warming to mass consciousness in the world (not just in America).  So, with that, please see this film and get everyone you know to see it. More importantly, please make lifestyle changes to lessen one's impact on our environment.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	ALUJ15UFI1422	Norma Lehmeierhartie	"It is obvious that Al Gore is driven by passion in his desire to help save the Earth from his book and movie, An Inconvenient Truth. Mr. Gore personally touched me by his passion when I mailed a review copy of my book, ""Harmonious Environment"" to him and he responded within weeks that he would read and comment on it.  He is an extremely busy man--but he selflessly found the time to personally type me a letter because my book deals with saving the planet and that is his mission.Although this is an extrememly difficult subject, it is a very easy to watch movie. Mr. Gore is engaging, articulate and warm. There are lovely shots of the earth and it is beautiful for a reason--Mr. Gore wants us to love and cherish our planet the way he does. The point he makes is just that--you care for what you love.  We--the stewards of the Earth--must take care of her.I always prefer the book version to the movie version, but in the case of An Inconvenient Truth, I loved them both. The advantage to the book is that it contains more insight into Mr. Gore's personal life, which I found fascinating.  However, if you are a movie person, rest assured that the book and movie cover virtually the same material.In 1968, as an undergraduate in Harvard, Al Gore was lucky enough to study under Roger Revelle, the first person to measure CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere. Mr. Gore writes: ""I will never forget the graph he [Revelle] drew on the blackboard or the dramatic message it conveyed: that something profoundly new was happening to the atmosphere of the entire planet and that this transformation was being caused by human beings.""The movie concludes with valuable, practical and easy ways in which we can reduce our impact on the earth. These tips are meant to empower us, because we can help stop global warming--each and every one of us.Watch this book now and fall in love with Earth.Author of award winning book, Harmonious Environment: Beautify, Detoxify and Energize Your Life, Your Home and Your Planet"	5.0	Watch this DVD--or Read the Book!	2007-04-13	14	7	7

This film is about removing reasonable doubt regarding the impact of human activity on global climate. Because of the film, it is now public knowledge that the debate is over: we are warming our planet. Any film that can accomplish such a thing is worthy of respect and applause REGARDLESS of which side of the ""isle"" you are on. Everyone should see this film, period. After seeing it if you aren't changed in SOME way then I recommend going to a doctor to check what species you are.

For those wondering what the movie is REALLY about, you should be prepared for about 60% of the movie covering the global warming issue framed by the other 40% that runs like a overview of how Gore became who he is today (son hit by car, sister dies, loses vote to Bush). Are his experiences important in making him who he is now? Sure. But does it detract from the overall power of the information? Yes. Crafty packaging and media buzz has seen fit to gloss over those aspects of the film and those who are expecting a feature length documentary on global warming (like I was) will have to deal with 45 minutes of close up shots of Gore pecking away at his Apple PowerBook and talking about growing up on a farm.

Even though I already know about the changes that had happened during the last few decades around the globe, the visual effects of these data create a deeper impression. The DVD feels more personal than the book, and it also helps that Gore is pretty funny sometimes, who knew?Some people have argued about the accuracy or validity of the predictions, but whether or not you are convinced of the data or not, wouldn't it be worthwhile to try to do the right thing? Just as the movie suggested, everybody can do their share to make earth a better place to live. I will share this DVD with as many friends as possible. For the past year or two, we've tried to use enery efficient appliances and light bulbs. I am even getting better at recycling, which was my shortcoming before.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A70YTUFJY5HXN	Olukayode Balogun	"Whilst not the most entertaining movie I've seen on DVD this year, I do believe this could be the most important. At first glance, the prospect of listening to the former Vice President wax lyrical about climate change while watching him show an array of PowerPoint slides, video clips and photographs didn't have much appeal but a few minutes in and I was rooted to my seat. (And I haven't got a scientific bone in my body). Director David Guggenheim captures Mr Gore's presentation style very effectively and in my view, no one but the most hardcore of denialists could fail to be persuaded by his arguments.But it's not just about Gore's arguments. Sure, his profile makes it more likely that we might listen to what he has to say than we might, say esteemed but unknown Mr Scientist A or esteemed or unknown Ms Scientist B but the facts as he presents them are incontrovertible. They are everywhere around us if we only care to look and in terms of what I hadn't seen or heard about, the movie was an eye-opener. I'd heard things were getting pretty bad but was genuinely shocked to sheep grazing on ski slopes that should be covered with snow, images of boats moored on riverbeds and lakebeds, and one particular image of a horse walking across the bed of the Amazon River. The Amazon River? In the middle of the Amazon rainforest?!The fact is that there's a whole lot more CO2 in the atmosphere than there ever was (at one point, Gore has to get on a hydraulic forklift truck to show us the peak of a CO2 emissions prediction) and this is undeniably having an effect on the world's climate. Some of the denouncements in some of the reviews I've read have been pretty vehement but none are surprising. Leaving aside the politics of the issue, even on a personal level, if the activities that make our cosy lives even more comfortable (and/or pay our hefty salaries) are the very ones that are pumping CO2 into the atmosphere, it's much, much easier to dismiss the evidence than it is to contemplate changing our behaviour. Hence the title of the movie. Behaviour change IS ALWAYS inconvenient. But we turn our heads away or stick them in the sand at huge risk. There could well be dire consequences. If not for us then for the generations coming up behind us. I don't have children and will probably be long gone before things get completely out of hand but I've got nephews and nieces and I care about them and their futures.But that's just me and I'm not trying to preach. That said, I do believe that even the smallest of changes can make a difference if enough of us choose to make them. I urge people to see this movie, to invite friends and family round to see it - and then tell all their other friends and family about it.DVD extras include: Commentary with the Director, Commentary with the Producers, a 30-minute update documentary with Al Gore, made after the theatrical release of the movie with even more worrying data, a documentary on the making of ""An Inconvenient Truth"" and the music video to the song with which the movie ends, ""I Need To Wake Up"" by Melissa Etheridge."	5.0	A VERY inconvenient truth!	2006-12-26	15	7	8
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A31D2B0N48J4H7	"Omar Halabieh ""Omar Halabieh"""	Below are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:1- &#34;The fundamental outline of the climate crisis Story is much the same now as it was then. The relationship between human civilization and the Earth has been utterly transformed by a combination of factors, including the population explosion, the technological revolution, and a willingness to ignore the future consequences of our present actions. The underlying reality is that we are colliding with the planet's ecological system, and its most vulnerable components are rumbling as a result...I have learned that, beyond death and taxes, there is at least one absolutely indisputable fact: Not only does human- in caused global warming exist, but it is also growing more and more dangerous, and at a pace that has now made it a planetary emergency.&#34;2- &#34;But along with the danger we face from global warming, this crisis also brings unprecedented opportunities. What are the opportunities such a crisis also offers? They include not just few jobs and new profits, though there will be plenty of both, we can build clean engines, we can harness the Sun and the wind; we can stop wasting energy; we can use our planet's plentiful coal resources without heating the planet. The procrastinators and deniers would have us believe this will be expensive. But in recent years, dozens of companies have cut emissions of heat-trapping gases while saving money. Some of the World's largest companies are moving aggressively to capture the enormous economic opportunities offered by a clean energy future.&#34;3- &#34;But I truly believe I was handed not just a second chance, but an obligation to pay attention to what matters and to do my part to protect and safeguard it, and to do whatever I can at this moment of danger to try to make sure that what is most precious about God's beautiful Earth&#8212;its liveability for us, our children, future generations&#8212;doesn't slip from our hands.&#34;4- &#34;&#34;he emerging consensus linking global warming to the increasingly destructive power of hurricanes has been based part on research showing a significant v; increase in the number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes. A separate study predicts that global warming will increase the strength of the average hurricane a full half-step on the well known five-step scale...As water temperatures go up, wind velocity goes up, and so does storm moisture condensation.&#34;5- &#34;Insurers base their rates&#8212;the amount you pay to protect your home against disaster&#8212;on their ability to calculate the risk of unexpected events. When extreme weather stops following predictable, historical patterns&#8212;as it appears is already happening&#8212;companies can no longer estimate risk accurately, which 1 turn makes it difficult to project what their losses will be. The only way to stay n business under these conditions would be to raise premiums for all insurance holders or to stop offering insurance in particularly risky areas, such as Florida and the Gulf coast, which already face increasingly devastating weather every summer. As one business leader put it, insurance companies face &#34;a perfect storm of rising weather losses, rising global temperatures, and more Americans than ever living in harm's way.&#34;&#34;6- &#34;There are many complex causes of the famine and genocide, but a little discussed contributing factor is the disappearance of Lake Chad, formerly the sixth largest lake in the world, in a period of only the last 40 years. &#34;7- &#34;In all of my journeys, I have searched for a better understanding of the climate crisis&#8212;and in all of them I have found not only evidence of the danger we face globally, but an expectation everywhere that the United States will be the nation to lead the world to a safer, brighter future. And as a result, since every journey took me back home, I have returned each time with a deeper conviction that the solution to this crisis that I have traveled so far to understand must begin right here at home.&#34;8- &#34;Losing something is one thing; forgetting what you've lost is something else again. Maybe I shouldn't generalize from my personal experience, but I do believe that our civilization has come perilously close to forgetting what we've lost and it then forgetting that we've lost it. This is caused in part by never having the chance to commune with nature. That may sound like so much hippie pap, but I defy anyone to take in this country's unspoiled treasures and not feel calmed, humbled, and rejuvenated by them. I believe that when God created us {and I do believe evolution was part of the process God used). He shaped us, breathed life and a soul into us, and then set us free  within nature, not separate from it, giving us intimate connections to all aspects of it. The relationship we have to the natural world is not a relationship between &#34;us&#34; and &#34;it.&#34; It is us, and we are of it. Our capacity for consciousness and abstract thought in no way separates us from nature. Our capacity for analysis sometimes leads us to an arrogant illusion; that we're so special and unique that nature isn't connected to us. But the fact is, we're inextricably tied.&#34;9- &#34;According to this way of thinking, if exploitation results in injury to the environment, so be it; nature will always heal itself, and no one should care. But what we do to nature we do to ourselves. The magnitude of environmental destruction is now on a scale few ever foresaw; the wounds no longer simply heal themselves. We have to act affirmatively to stop the harm.&#34;10- &#34;But despite the negatives, there is something powerful and resilient we must never lose sight of: American constitutional democracy still has the potential to confer on the average citizen the dignity and majesty of self-governance. t is still, in Churchill's well-known phrase, &#34;the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.&#34; When it works the way our founders intended, the very act of self-governing can produce m indescribable feeling of goodness and harmony that no cynic will ever be able to diminish.&#34;11- &#34;The parable of the Aral Sea has a simple message: Mistakes in our dealings with Mother Nature can now have much larger, many of our new technologies confer upon us new power without automatically giving us new wisdom.&#34;12- &#34;Our new technologies, combined with our new numbers have made us, collectively, a force of nature.&#34;13- &#34;Now it is up to us to use our democracy and our God-given ability to reason with one another about our future and make moral choices to change the policies and behaviors that would, if continued, leave a degraded, diminished, and hostile planet for our children and grandchildren&#8212;and for humankind We must choose instead to make the 21 st century a time of renewal. By seizing the opportunity that is bound up in this crisis, we cam unleash the creativity innovation,and inspiration that are just as much a part of our human birthright as our vulnerability to greed and pettiness.The choice is ours. The responsibility is ours. The future is ours.&#34;	5.0	The Responsibility Is Ours!	2013-12-29	2	1	1

AIT is long on hype, short on science.  Like so many eco-scare books from the past (Malthus's ""An Essay on the Principle of Population"", Rachel Carson's ""Silent Spring"", Paul Ehrlich's ""The Population Bomb"", etc.) Gore weaves a tale of Future Doom from unconnected threads w/o much actual foundation.  The Earth has been warmer than it is today and the human race flourished.  Under some of the ""worst case scenarios"" sea levels may rise as much as 30 inches over the next 100 years:  if the human race can't outrun a 0.3"" tsunami each year perhaps it's time to chuck it in and turn the planet over to the cockroaches.And so on.  Ironically if the crisis is so severe and so imminent as Gore paints in his film then the only chance the human race has for survival is to build a bunch of nuclear power plants and stop using fossil fuels altogether, because nothing he proposes will reduce CO2 emissions enough in the time left before climate change is irreversable, according to the alarmists."	1.0	Gore the Alarmist	2007-01-09	80	33	47

Still maybe his real purpose in life is to bring the threat of global warming to our attention in a way which can be easily watched and absorbed.Gore and Laurie David deserve the kudos they have received and I am glad they won the Oscar as it brought this film to the attention of the public at large.This is an important film on an important subject and it should be shown wherever possible.  One indication of how important it is is that the segment which doesn't want to talk about global warming is attacking Gore's lifestyle.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A7S389T88I0HC	Patricia Laverty	"The problems with AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH, the documentary about Al Gore's long winded lectures on global warming, start with the title. The film would have more aptly been titled A VERY CONVENIENT THEORY. Parroting the conventional wisdom is anything but inconvenient, and, no matter how religiously you present your vision, a theory is not the same thing as a fundamental truth.As Gore drones on and on, promising gloom and doom if we don't believe him and do what he says, it is easy be seduced by his pictures of disasters and his ominous graphs. Since he has no doubt about his scary theories of climate change, we aren't encouraged to think either. We are lulled into a sense of impending and certain cataclysmic change, with the oceans about to drown us all.This propaganda piece is slick -- it is directed by Davis Guggenheim, who directed the ""Uncertainty"" episode of NUMB3RS, a television drama that tries to convince viewers that math can predict absolutely anything. AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH's purpose appears to be as much about bolstering Al Gore's presidential prospects as it is about seriously examining climate change. From watching hanging chads to visits to Gore's boyhood home to sad stories about his family's tragedies, the movie has everything that any campaign video would want.But, let's be honest, the ""sky is falling"" always sells, both books and politicians. Looking at only the past century, we have had warnings every decade that oil was about to run out in the following decade, but the proven reserves stubbornly just keep going up rather than being exhausted as predicted. In the middle of the last century, it was the so-called ""population bomb,"" which was predicted to soon cause widespread famine. And, most germane of all, the media in the early 1970s was full of dire predictions by ""all of the experts"" that we were entering the next ice age and that mankind was responsible. Contrast this with today, when the media is just as full of predictions that the opposite is about to occur. The only constant is that ""we"" are still to blame, so we are told that we have to fix it.Gore claims that the scientists' elaborate computer models predict that absolute disaster is coming and is already underway. What he doesn't remind you is that your local meteorologist can't even predict whether it will rain tomorrow with much accuracy. Yet, we are supposed to believe that these models, which once predicted global cooling and are now predicting global warming, are to be taken as gospel. Remember Long Term Capital Management? They hired some of the smartest Ph.D.s in the entire world in order to build a super-sophisticated stock market model. In the end, it proved to be an abysmal failure, with its collapse rippling through the world's financial markets. Models that attempt to predict the world's long-term climate are a pipe dream, with accuracy parameters so low as to be nearly useless.The shapes and directions of many of the graphs that Gore produces as facts are in dispute, and on some of them, the root cause of the graph's direction is anything but conclusively known. Sometimes, he widely labels things as being a consensus, which they aren't, and, at other times, he misstates the consensus. He says, for example, that the experts predict that global temperatures will rise a minimum -- a ""minimum,"" he repeats -- of five degrees, whereas most reports have scientists predicting an average of a modest one degree rise over the next hundred years -- an amount very close to the error variations in the data.As another example, Gore produces a graph showing that Japanese car companies are much more profitable than American ones. He attributes this solely to American auto companies refusing to make the fuel efficient cars we really want. With many ""American"" cars containing more foreign parts than ""foreign"" cars, which are increasingly made right here in America, the most obvious difference is that Japanese car companies are in right-to-work states which don't require union membership as a precondition for employment. What the graph really shows then is mainly the cost of union labor, not some sinister plot by American car companies to force their customers to buy gas guzzlers.Professor Richard Lindzen, the head of atmospheric studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is one of many scientists who don't believe in the religion of global warming, as preached by Gore and others. Professor Lindzen acknowledges that there has been some warming in the past few decades, just as the period of 1940-1970 featured cooling temperatures worldwide. What isn't clear, as Professor Lindzen has pointed out, is to what extent man has been the cause, and whether we can do much to change the temperature in the future.Moreover, it isn't clear that slightly warmer temperatures are bad. Some studies have suggested that it would produce a longer growing season, thus being a net plus for the planet. Of course, none of these opposing theories are presented in Al Gore's documentary, other than the times he ridicules those who disagree with him with a mocking tone, suggesting that they must be idiots.Others have argued that, even if we aren't sure whether man is the cause or not, we should immediately take action. Gore keeps pressing the point that fighting global warming isn't a political issue but a ""moral imperative.""Taking the wrong action, even for the best of intentions, can be worse than inaction. We banned DDT in order to attempt to save some animals and have killed millions of humans in Africa due to malaria, an inconvenient truth that African leaders keep trying to impress upon western do-gooders.""What gets us in trouble is not what we don't know. It's what we know for sure that just ain't so,"" Mark Twain told us. Gore uses this quote early on in the film. Although Gore thinks it applies to those who disagree with his theories. The most obvious application of Twain's quote is to the global warming zealots who believe in their theory with unquestioning and religious intensity."	1.0	A VERY CONVENIENT THEORY	2009-09-16	49	27	22

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3FKGKUCI3DG9U	Paul Moskowitz	"New analyses show that climate change is moving faster than anticipated by the reports in this movie.The award of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize to Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, has brought some added publicity to the problem of global warming or climate change. You may read or download for yourself the IPCC summary report which is available on the IPCC dot ch web site. Alternatively, you may wish to just look out the window. The people of New Zealand have been able to see icebergs large enough for helicopter landings floating by within a few miles of their shores for the first time in recorded history.  Where I live, it seemed to take forever for our fall leaves to change color. We had a record warm October. The list of events that we see that have been predicted by climate scientists is seemingly without end.  According to the IPCC, before the end of this century, we may live in a world of elevated temperatures, rising sea level, and extreme weather.However, as dire as the predictions are, the reality is much worse.  The climate models are indeed inaccurate ... in their timing.  Climate change has accelerated beyond the predictions of only one or two years ago. In this movie, Al Gore states that the Arctic will be ice free in the summer in 40 years. That would put it about 2046. However, there have been news reports in the last month that NASA climate scientists are now predicting the summer of 2012 as the date for an ice-free Arctic. The ice in question is floating sea ice. Its melting will not raise the level of the world's oceans. However, an ice free Arctic Ocean will absorb more sunlight, increasing the Arctic warming trend. If the Arctic Ocean is ice free, can the collapse of the Greenland ice cap be far behind? There is enough ice on Greenland to raise the world's sea level by 15 to 20 feet should it melt or as it seems more likely flow into the ocean.The question used to be whether we will be able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in time to save the planet for future generations. That is no longer the issue.  Can we now slow climate change enough so that we can enjoy the benefits of civilization, e.g. the Internet, HDTV, food, etc., through our own lifetimes?  In our town, we are working to get our local government to ratify the US Mayors Agreement on Climate Change to work toward the goal of reducing our Greenhouse gas emissions below our 1990 levels by the year 2012. This is a quite reasonable goal; change the light bulbs to CFLs, make buildings energy-efficient, drive low carbon footprint vehicles. We can all do this; save some money and maybe the planet too.I also recommend the books ""With Speed and Violence: Why Scientists Fear Tipping Points in Climate Change"", about recent scientific investigations and their implications for global warming, andGlobal Warning: The Last Chance for Change, which details the politics of climate change."	5.0	Climate Change is Moving Fast	2008-01-06	0	0	0

Sorry, the earth goes thru climate cycles every so often, Either on a micro or macro level....what would Mr. Gore have called the great ice age? What would Mr. Gore have called the great dust bowl of the 30's? Gobal warming? It's a nice movie, nice visuals and landscapes......but proving science? no. Remember, the earth is 72% water, 72% carbon and oxygen! The earth lives and dies because of water content.....not because of us. If Gore is right...we are dead, with no chance of fixing the problem. The fix doesn't exist to make a difference in our dying. 100 years of industrial revolution does not make 10,000,000 years null and void.	2.0	um.........	2007-01-08	25	8	17

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A39L6FG6O2IZ75	person	"I heard great things about this movie. Even people who said he took liberties with the facts said that it was extremely well done, so I decided I would see it. I even decided that I was going to be open minded when I watched it. Despite everything I know about Gore, I really did try to be open minded. It was NOT great.Instead of being called An Inconvenient Truth (can you get more pretentious?), it should have been called The Al Gore Show. That's really what it was! The ENTIRE movie is Al Gore giving a lecture about global warming, or as he likes to call it, ""The Global Climate Crisis"" (I was wrong, it just got more pretentious). He just stands there droning on and on and on about how if he isn't elected as president of the world, we and our pets will all die when the world blows up. He DOES offer a very convincing argument for global warming and does a VERY good job destroying all of the arguments against it, and even against his specific ideas on global warming (i.e. it is caused by human industry). However, in order to prove this point, he just stands there showing charts and statistics (all of which are unsubstantiated) and never even bothers to quote, let alone actually bring on stage a real scientist who knows anything about global warming. Al Gore is the only one who talks in the whole movie! He doesn't even say where he is getting all of these charts and statistics he is using! He could have (and probably did) get all of his charts from different sources, picking and choosing which data best fit what he wanted to prove! BUT... That was the GOOD part of the movie!Parts of the movie that do not consist of Al Gore giving a lecture are of Al Gore driving around in a car and talking about his LIFE! That's right AL GORE'S LIFE! How narcissistic is this guy!? He talks bout how he worked on a tobacco farm. He talks about the death of his son. He talks about the death of his sister. How do these things relate to global warming? How are they relevant to anything? Only the supreme being, Mr. Gore can tell us! But WAIT! It gets WORSE! In one part of the movie he even talks about the election (yes, the 2000 presidential election in which he whined about recounts and the people in Florida that MEANT to vote for him). He talks about how even though he actually won, he isn't bitter about it. He understands that he has to move on with his life. What an understanding guy!*says sarcastically* One positive thing that I did notice is that Al Gore does seem much more.... how should I say it.... HUMAN than he did when he was vice president/presidential candidate. He is no longer the lifeless block of wood with no muscles in his face. He actually smiles sometimes and even *gasp* makes jokes (not very funny ones, but still, kudos for trying). He also looks much larger than he did 6 years ago, but it is my theory that he hasn't gained weight, he's just refusing to exhale so as to reduce his CO2 emissions.Here is the inconvenient truth Mr. Gore, I just wasted 2 hours of my life watching your movie! I am ashamed that I finished the whole thing! Even if Al Gore is right about this whole global warming conspiracy, the movie is NOT well done. It is basically just a propaganda film made to convince you of some huge problem so that Gore can catapult himself into office. But here's the kicker...

The most touching is the story of his sister's death from lung cancer, followed by his father's recognition that being a tobacco farmer did not cut it in the moral sphere.  By the same token this business of global warming through our societal addiction to oil, coal and other ""cheap"" (if you don't count the consequences) fuels, is also brought out as a moral issue for our generation.

In fact, they're thriving. Gore predicted no sea ice in the Arctic Sea by the summer of 2013 and there was 50 percent more than the prior year.

This documentary puts together all the facts and shows footage of the melting of the glaciers, as well as other evidence, to present a convincing argrument of the immiment threat of global warming.  The end of the film leaves us with the reassurance that something can be done with the right political pressures and our own conservation.I would have liked to have heard some of the agruments from those that don't believe that civilization adds to the global warming problem.  Although Mr. Gore may not agree with those views, I would have liked to have at least heard their viewpoint and perhaps seen Mr. Gore criticize the more prevalent arguments from the non-believers.Overall, you will get some understanding of an important issue.  I'm sure there is more to it than this film depicts, but it's certainly a good foundation.Obviously, this isn't a film you would want to watch on a Friday night after a long week at work.

Hall ""owner of Poor Yorick's Almanack"""	It's a bit odd to go into a darkened movie theater--the scene of American escapism for the last one hundred years--to receive such a brisk wake-up call. Still, watching this movie in a theater with hundreds of strangers is, I think, the best way to view it because we are all in this together.If you've been politically aware in the last 10 years, chances are there isn't any one fact in this movie that you haven't heard before. It is a shocking movie nonetheless, and the shock comes from seeing all those facts marshalled together, presenting a clear-cut case. Here's the inconvenient truth: the earth is getting warmer, that our actions are the reasons why it is getting warmer, and that we must all work together to solve this problem or else it will become a crisis for humanity.The good news is that there are things we can do now that will hopefully avert or diminish the coming havoc, but the first step is learning about the problem. Even though this film is intercut with scenes that often feel like a Al Gore political ad, it's the best way for most people to learn about this problem. The data is explained in easy-to-digest graphics and examples.I urge you to see this movie. Take your parents, take your kids.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1TUDEC66M9FO3	Preston C. Enright	"As Roger Ebert said in blurbing ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" - ""You owe it to yourself to see this film.""  I'd add that you owe it to future generations as well.Regarding the naysaying of the cause and effects of global warming, I'd recommend the book ""The Heat Is On"" by Ross Gelbspan.  Gelbspan has been dealing with the agents of big oil and king coal for years, and he exposes them quite effectively.Even if we were to put aside all concerns about potential catastrophes from global warming - the ecological damage that is caused by oil and coal extraction is heartbreaking.  Books like ""Resource Rebels: Native Challenges to Mining and Oil Corporations"" by Al Gedicks go into the details.  Then there is the issue of ""Peak Oil,"" covered by the DVD ""The End of Suburbia.""Finally, for some hopeful news, I'd suggest the DVD ""The Power of Community: How Cuba Survived Peak Oil.""Additionally, there are all sorts of alternatives being developed here in the US.  Denver just hosted 13,000 architects, interior designers, land use planners and others for the ""Green Build Expo"" (it will be held in LA next year).  They know that green construction is not only good for the environment, but it's also good for business.I hope Al Gore starts to emphasize the ways we can transition toward the next industrial revolution - the revolution that is outlined in books like ""Natural Capitalism"" by Paul Hawken."	5.0	Just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak.	2006-12-12	31	19	12

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A33ZYFE8XMKKR1	"P. Scott Pope ""Scott Pope"""	Al Gore did a fantastic job in articulating the consequences of global warming in An Inconvenient Truth. While providing a narrative explaining the risks of the human race's reliance on fossil fuel, he also offers stunning images showing concrete examples of the effects of global warming. Indeed, An Inconvenient Truth makes an excellent movie that the whole family can watch.One misconception with this movie is that it is dense with facts and figures explaining scientific data. While there is substantive information contained in Gore's narration, a large collection images and interviews allow the viewer to quickly absorb the message.  In these images, various ice formations from 50-70 years ago are juxtaposed with their current state.  In total, they make for a compelling story alone.What is missing from the story is a thorough explanation of the economics behind conservation and energy independence that any Republican would love. Energy independence and conservation offer a host of pure economic motives including improving overall industrial efficiency and promoting domestic agricultural resources. Likewise, investment in alternative technology will keep America in the forefront of the alternative energy market where it has been losing ground to Germany and Japan. This virtuous circle is not outlined in this movie, unfortunately.An Inconvenient Truth serves its mission in explaining to the lay community the causes and consequences of Global Warming. Al Gore accomplishes this in telling interesting story with supporting evidence. Whether you are an environmentalist or merely hardcore republican concerned about energy security, spread the message by inviting friends and business colleague to watch the movie.NOTES:The Economic Story that is missing:*PURE ECONOMICS - HIGH ROIImproved energy efficiency ultimately costs less (e.g. compact fluorescent light bulbs, diesel automobiles)Provides higher performance (e.g. greater home insulation, improved windows)*REDUCTION OF FOREIGN LEVERAGE ON UNITED STATESLessens vulnerability to foreign powersReduces US military presence in other countries*MACROECONOMICSProvides consumers with more spending power (e.g. less spent on electricity allows more spending at Wal-Mart)Reduces peripheral waste (e.g. reduction of container packaging requires less waste hauling)*DOMESTIC RESOURCE ULTILIZATIONPromotes domestic sources of energy (e.g. corn and soybeans)Domestic production of wind power and solar systems*INFRASTRUCTURE STABILITYDistributed power fights disruption (e.g. solar panels provide local power - down power lines don't impact end user)A broader range of energy sources combats reliance on a single source that can be disruptedFights spikes that cause blackouts (e.g. photovoltaic cells produce power during highest demand times)Reduces strain on current infrastructure (e.g. reduces creation of more power lines, transformers)Better use of land area (e.g. solar panels on roof require no additional land area)*BETTER UTILIZATION OF HUMAN POWERWalking, bicycling, using the stairs improves health and fights obesityPedal power and public transportation reduces congestions	5.0	A Great Message and an Even Better Gift	2007-01-07	7	4	3

There is no question that global warming is real(and I knew before I saw this documentary) and that we are, at the least, significantly contributing to it. What blows me away is seeing the evidence of it in such an incontrovertible manner.There are many things we can do to reduce our ""carbon footprint"", even without dramatically changing our lifestyles, things like using window fans or attic fans instead of turning on the A/C on relatively cool days, turning down the heat a notch and wearing an additional layer of clothing instead, being ""energy-aware"" in the home, at work and on the road.

The one thing that stood clear in this film was that he stuck to scientific data--the facts.  As I watched this film, one adage came to mind that I once read on a placard in a zoo, and that was: ""We did not inherit the earth. We merely borrowed it from our children."" I was profoundly moved by his message and immediately felt duped by contra-conspiracies about the truth in our environment. I strongly urge everyone to have a copy of this film to educate themselves, their children, and their community. Religion, politics, and race need-not-be an issue here for we definitely all have this ""one world"" in common. In fact, I'm off to order several copies of this DVD to hand out as stocking-stuffers for Christmas. I applaud Al Gore and all involved in putting this message out.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1UPWZH2RQ7OLQ	Randall Warnick	Al Gore has been trying to generate some interest in this issue of global warming, but he doesn't seem to be having much success. Some of us seem to think that human generated global warming is pretty likely, but, basicly, those who could get the largest polluter nation involved are pretty much just paying a little lip service to the idea and completely ignoring it. Mostly, it would seem, we are preferring to pursue ill conceived war, heavier hummers, continued unlivable minimum wages, immigration to compensate for domestic population control attempts, and higher and higher priced medical care, unrestricted rewards for out of control medecine profits and campaign donations, and little or no interest in changing any of it. Rather, we seem, mostly, to be enjoying this thoughtless decadence. Responsibility isn't where our bread is buttered.What are our dreams then? Certainly not protecting our environment and our fellow inhabitants of the planet. To become a failing CEO perhaps, with a thirty million dollar bonus anyway? Or, we might just become a motion picture star of the tabloids. Thus, we make the planet small. Thankyou.	5.0	I Think Mr. Gore is Still Trying	2007-09-28	0	0	0

Earth is already showing many signs of worldwide climate change.* Average temperatures have climbed 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degree Celsius) around the world since 1880, much of this in recent decades, according to NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.* The rate of warming is increasing. The 20th century's last two decades were the hottest in 400 years and possibly the warmest for several millennia, according to a number of climate studies. And the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that 11 of the past 12 years are among the dozen warmest since 1850.* The Arctic is feeling the effects the most. Average temperatures in Alaska, western Canada, and eastern Russia have risen at twice the global average, according to the multinational Arctic Climate Impact Assessment report compiled between 2000 and 2004.* Arctic ice is rapidly disappearing, and the region may have its first completely ice-free summer by 2040 or earlier. Polar bears and indigenous cultures are already suffering from the sea-ice loss.* Glaciers and mountain snows are rapidly melting--for example, Montana's Glacier National Park now has only 27 glaciers, versus 150 in 1910. In the Northern Hemisphere, thaws also come a week earlier in spring and freezes begin a week later.* Coral reefs, which are highly sensitive to small changes in water temperature, suffered the worst bleaching--or die-off in response to stress--ever recorded in 1998, with some areas seeing bleach rates of 70 percent. Experts expect these sorts of events to increase in frequency and intensity in the next 50 years as sea temperatures rise.* An upsurge in the amount of extreme weather events, such as wildfires, heat waves, and strong tropical storms, is also attributed in part to climate change by some experts.Are Humans Causing It?* ""Very likely,"" the IPCC said in a February 2007 report.The report, based on the work of some 2,500 scientists in more than 130 countries, concluded that humans have caused all or most of the current planetary warming. Human-caused global warming is often called anthropogenic climate change.* Industrialization, deforestation, and pollution have greatly increased atmospheric concentrations of water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, all greenhouse gases that help trap heat near Earth's surface. (See an interactive feature on how global warming works.)* Humans are pouring carbon dioxide into the atmosphere much faster than plants and oceans can absorb it.* These gases persist in the atmosphere for years, meaning that even if such emissions were eliminated today, it would not immediately stop global warming.* Some experts point out that natural cycles in Earth's orbit can alter the planet's exposure to sunlight, which may explain the current trend. Earth has indeed experienced warming and cooling cycles roughly every hundred thousand years due to these orbital shifts, but such changes have occurred over the span of several centuries. Today's changes have taken place over the past hundred years or less.* Other recent research has suggested that the effects of variations in the sun's output are ""negligible"" as a factor in warming, but other, more complicated solar mechanisms could possibly play a role.What's Going to Happen?A follow-up report by the IPCC released in April 2007 warned that global warming could lead to large-scale food and water shortages and have catastrophic effects on wildlife.* Sea level could rise between 7 and 23 inches (18 to 59 centimeters) by century's end, the IPCC's February 2007 report projects. Rises of just 4 inches (10 centimeters) could flood many South Seas islands and swamp large parts of Southeast Asia.* Some hundred million people live within 3 feet (1 meter) of mean sea level, and much of the world's population is concentrated in vulnerable coastal cities. In the U.S., Louisiana and Florida are especially at risk.* Glaciers around the world could melt, causing sea levels to rise while creating water shortages in regions dependent on runoff for fresh water.* Strong hurricanes, droughts, heat waves, wildfires, and other natural disasters may become commonplace in many parts of the world. The growth of deserts may also cause food shortages in many places.* More than a million species face extinction from disappearing habitat, changing ecosystems, and acidifying oceans.* The ocean's circulation system, known as the ocean conveyor belt, could be permanently altered, causing a mini-ice age in Western Europe and other rapid changes.* At some point in the future, warming could become uncontrollable by creating a so-called positive feedback effect. Rising temperatures could release additional greenhouse gases by unlocking methane in permafrost and undersea deposits, freeing carbon trapped in sea ice, and causing increased evaporation of water.What is Climategate?In late November 2009, hackers unearthed hundreds of emails at the U.K.'s University of East Anglia that exposed private conversations among top-level British and U.S. climate scientists discussing whether certain data should be released to the public. [Do we know who the hackers were? Were they skeptics? Might be worth noting]The email exchanges also refer to statistical tricks used to illustrate climate change? trends, and call climate skeptics idiots, according to the New York Times.One such trick was used to create the well-known hockey-stick graph, which shows a sharp uptick in temperature increases during the 20th century. Former U.S vice president Al Gore relied heavily on the graph as evidence of human-caused climate change in the documentary An Inconvenient Truth.The data used for this graph come from two sources: thermostat readings and tree-ring samples.While thermostat readings have consistently shown a temperature rise over the past hundred years, tree-ring samples show temperature increases stalling around 1960.On the hockey-stick graph, thermostat-only data is grafted onto data that incorporates both thermostat and tree-ring readings, essentially presenting a seamless picture of two different data sets, the hacked emails revealed.But scientists argue that dropping the tree-ring data was no secret and has been written about in the scientific literature for years.Climate change skeptics have heralded the emails as an attempt to fool the public, according to the Times.Yet climate scientists maintain that these controversial points are small blips that are inevitable in scientific research, and that the evidence for human-induced climate change is much broader and still widely accepted.Free Email News UpdatesSign up for our Inside National Geographic newsletter.

Gore covers their misinformation theories and shows why they are junk, very effectively.

It's influence has dictated policy not only in Washington, but globally as well. It is a well - made film, which takes a complex issue, and makes it easy to understand, with effective use of video, graphs, audio, and other techniques that maximize the subjective and recall of the human mind. Now, it may not have the technical innovations and obsessive perfection of Leni Reifesnshtal's famous film, but it does perhaps do a better job of creating a point of view than the The landmark documentary.Trouble is, both are built on a foundation of lies. History has shown the lies of Triumph, but not even the frigid winter and empirical refutation of the statistics of this film can overcome the voracious desire to believe this is all true.*****SIDE NOTE******What is often overlooked is the story buried beneath the story, where Al Gore discusses his lonely childhood, who was whisked around the country according to the needs of his U.S. Senator father. Gore's stone face can't hide what appears to be a deep sense of feeling useless and inferior, of the sort that is so strong it can become the driving force  the driving force of  a person's life.

He is a professional at trying to seize money and power for personal gain.  If you want to educate yourself on this topic I am sure there are better books to buy written by people who actually understand this complicated subject.Secondly the presentation is second rate, lackluster, and boring.  It is really just a lecture given by Al Gore himself with really no interesting footage whatsoever.  Public television documentaries on science such as NOVA or NATURE are usually much better done and more factual.Thirdly Al Gore himself doesn't believe the things he says in this movie.  He practices an unenvironmental friendly lifestyle.  Reports indicate that he uses up twenty times more energy than the average American.  This leads one to question his motives and I doubt they are altruistic.  Do the proceeds he receives from this movie go to bettering the environment.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AXOS8IWBXNZGT	"Richard W Little ""I am a maple leaf on the wi..."	"Here I am, slowly melting in my apartment. Last weekend, however, as a part of my ""beat the heat"" program, I went out to see the Al Gore film, An Inconvenient Truth. It was part of my summer viewing plan, and somehow, given the temperature outside, it seemed fitting.Now, I'm not a man who's always been a fan of Al Gore. For the most part, I've agreed with his politics, though I was never big on the music censorship thing (though that was mostly Tipper...?). I just think he held back during the 2000 election campaign, unwilling to appear too intelligent in comparison to his opponent. It's too bad; I think he could have cleaned Bush's clock. Why? Because he comports himself rationally and intelligently and passionately in this film.The film alternates between personal stories and views into Gore's life, the presentation of data and scientific analysis on global warming, analysis and views on the politics involved in the issue, and thoughts on what we can do about the situation ourselves.So, let me be clear about my own views on the issues at hand. The data is particularly convincing, that we have an issue of extreme importance to us all. We aren't taking it as seriously as we should. We are already seeing the consequences. Things are likely to get much worse, if we do nothing. And, frankly, we shouldn't be surprised at the cause and effect relationship here.Yes, the planet's climate is a complex mathematical system. However, we're hitting the system with a hammer, and the system is going to ring in response. We're not going to like the ringing response we get.

From this side of the planet, that the Bush administration has blundered and bullied with fiendish, manipulative disregard over stricken people's and places(including its own), is plain-speak. It's not exclusive Bush behaviour, but it tightens screws on the worse features of a so-called democratic system. The Florida fiasco was a demonstation of its neglect to fulfil the faith in democratic processes and principles. Al Gore knows this better than anyone. Not that until this film had I much cared for Al. But he stands tall here, tall and articulate in a way that Bush couldn't conceive. His elucidatory lecture, and the heroic, poised stance he delivers to the electorate should be compulsory medicine in a sane republic. The lecture isn't patronising, and saved from excessive polish by Guggenheim's pulling back into Gore's personal struggle with a sick son, a dead sister, and a dying river in his back yard. Technically it's pace is sufficiently varied to hold the attention of this graph-phobic viewer. The news isn't good. It's sobering but not alarmist and hovers above the debate of our capacity for engendering sufficient political will. We are that will and must 'pray' with our feet.

Yeppers, Al Gore is not nearly as cute and cuddly as Mumbo the penguin.On the other hand, what Mr. Gore gives us is a view as to what's going on with the world, and what we are doing to make the situation worse, or in some cases, better.  I know it's tough to watch and listen too without being drawn into his point-of-view.  He seems to have backed up his view with strong evidence, and we should take care to pay attention.Is he wrong?  If his survey of the scientific literature is correct, then the scientists seem to say no.  We can always hope that he's not.  We can always hope that the continual stories of how our climates seem to be changing are wrong.  In fact, I hope he is, because if he's not we're in for a beating from the weather.For those of you who are opposed to what Mr. Gore points toward, it is up to you to convince us, with the science to back it up, of your point-of-view.

To see a politcal figure truely be passionate about a moral issue is not commonplace enough, thus, its genuinity may be difficult to ascertain for some.Unfortunatly for me, and surely many others, the things I value and deem as important issues of concern don't ever seem to be supported by the sole policies of either of the mainstreem politcal parties.  Mabye a mixture of the two ideologies, or even a whole new set of gentlemen neatly pampered with make-up would present new, more intriguing approaches as to how to lead our country and how things should be prioritized.Either way, it would seem logical that the place to start, the initial politcal focal point, is with what would prove to be the biggest current issue at hand and what most affects our well being.  Welp, that would seem be the world's environment and our treatment of it.  The environment is our grounds for survival, and humankind's well being is reliant on its well being.  It is this concept that Gore embraces, and, therefore, he has grabbed the attention of all people alike.  For those who have watched this documentary and have been left only with an image of Al humping a tree, don't be so quick as to forget that issues concerning the environment will in turn affect, in some way, all other issues that concern humankind.  Dismissing him as just another environmentalist will not accomplish much of anything beyond ignorance.This documentary is surely worth watching!

Basically, this is the same garbage we were fed in the 70's regarding ""global cooling"" and the emminent ice age we were heading towards.  Though I applaud Mr. Gore for being passionate, I must condemn him for being uninformed when it comes to the actual data and hold contempt for him for advancing such an ill advised and unscientific agenda.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"This should not be a controversial film.  That it is baffles and confuses me.  Sure, the energy industry has disseminates a vast amount of misinformation on the issue, making it seem that global warming is a contestable issue (it is not:  the scientific community is completely unanimous on the issue--the only people who disagree are scientists on corporate payrolls).  But what about fundamental self-interest?  This should be a nonpartisan issue.  If the environmental catastrophe that many have been predicting for several decades and towards which we have been inching year by year takes place, who benefits?  The answer is no one.  Regardless of your political position, a fundamental quality of life is required for any human being to have the luxury of a political position.The documentary is largely a film presentation of a slide show that Al Gore has given over a thousand times over the past couple of decades.  It is one that he has constantly updated and honed and at this point it has been fine tuned to a remarkable degree.  Al Gore is clearly a man without an agenda here, unless you conceive that being passionately and honestly concerned about the fate of the planet an ""agenda.""  But usually when we use ""agenda"" we imply that someone is trying to serve their own self-interest by putting something over on others.  Gore's naysayers need to ask:  precisely how does Al Gore benefit if you believe him?  In fact, he doesn't stand to benefit at all.  Some cynically claim that his film is really about a run for the presidency, but he has repeatedly denied that he has any intention of running in 2008 and the timing of the film would seem to be more than a little off for a run in 2012 or 2016.  No, he seems to have done this film simply because it has long been the consuming issue in his life.Person after person has and will continue to ask upon seeing this film:  where was this Al Gore in 2000?  He is charming, funny, warm, human, even--gasp--charismatic.  And for those of us who remember him as somewhat stiff in 1988, 1992, and 2000, he seems amazingly at ease.  I don't think there is any question that had we seen this Al Gore in 2000, he would have been president.Basically all this film tries to do is state as graphically and as clearly as possible the facts concerning global warming.  I won't repeat all the details, but I will say that anyone who has been at all uncertain about what global warming is and how it is caused and what its effects are will be clear on it after seeing this.  In the wake of the release of this film, a number of environmental scientists have spoken out on the film and confirmed its essential accuracy.  Industry ""scientists"" have stated otherwise, but it is hard to trust anyone whose paycheck depends on their holding to a particular position.  The charts and graphs that he uses are amazingly clear and aid his presentation.  And the statistical evidence that he assembles is impressive.  The most disturbing part of the presentation, however, is the large amount of photographic evidence.  He shows a number of before and after photos of glaciers from around the world.  They are highly disturbing in showing the dramatic shrinking or disappearance of massive amounts of ice.All in all, this is an amazingly well done popular presentation of the current state of scientific thinking on global warming.  Will it make a difference?  I'm unfortunately doubtful.  I personally think it will take a disaster of unimagined proportions to activate the United States--about the only nation in the world that is refusing to do anything about the problem (as Gore shows in the film, even China has vastly higher emission standards on is cars)--to do anything.  Hurricanes might do it.  Environmental science says that as the oceans continue to warm, hurricanes will continue to gain in strength.  If we have an increasing number of category 4 hurricanes in the next two decades, will people finally come around?  Or will it take a dramatic rise in the ocean's water levels due to the melting of the polar ice caps?  Or will the critics even then insist that this is all a natural, not a human made, phenomena?I recommend this film as highly as possible.  It is not only a fascinating film that makes compulsive viewing, but on what is arguably the most important issue in the world today.  Without a viable environment, nothing else matters.  The only issue ought to be not whether we respond to this impending crisis, but how."	5.0	An extremely good documentary on one of the world's most pressing problems	2006-06-11	45	32	13

Fisher	"As an environmental scientist, I find these soft-science/hardball political presentations of the global warming discussion distressing and unhelpful. While they rally the convinced, having partisan political types at the forefront of the discussion is probably unhelpful. To wit, about a third of this movie turns out to be a self promotion video complete with a replay of 2000 election footage.About the ""movie"": it's actually a filmation of the presentation Al Gore has made for some time on Global Warming. In it he tries to make the case that nearly everything we are measuring on this dynamic earth is the result of man-made CO2 and other green-house gasses. The audience is bombarded with a long series of charts, graphs, and suppositions that make for a compelling argument - IF one has little or no knowledge coming into the presentation.And this is where this production goes terribly wrong, the fact checking was terrible, the cherry-picked data was obvious and heavy-handed, and finally the movie ends up serving those who oppose any discussion of global warming more than it helps the cause. Two examples:An Inconvenient Truth asserts that a sea-level rise of 20 feet is a realistic short-term prospect - yet, the 2005 joint statement by the science academies of the Western nations warns of sea-level rise in the four to 35 inches range in the 21st century.Gore discusses the Earth's atmosphere as relatively thin, and declares that, ""The problem we now face is that this thin layer of atmosphere is being thickened by huge quantities of carbon dioxide."" Hello? Thickness has nothing to do with global warming people. Carbon dioxide has molecular bonds that vibrate on the same wavelengths at which infrared energy radiates upward from Earth's surface - meaning that the vibration warms the CO2, which makes things hotter. Further the references to nitrogen are pure nonsense, since it doesn't play a role.My warning is to not let the politicians ruin the scientific process, no matter how noble the cause may be."	2.0	What passes for science these days is sad	2006-11-17	91	35	56

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1L1F2EXCO0RMK	Rochelle Olviga	I first heard of the movie 'An Inconvenient Truth' watching the last Oscars where it won the Best Documentary award. I was somewhat surprised that a politician was the purveyor of this movie. The skeptic in me thought it was reelection propaganda but when I got to see the movie this morning, the messenger (US Vice President Al Gore) and his motives became insignificant next to the message.In the movie, there were some throwbacks to his personal life and political career that in my opinion should have been in the features section of the DVD instead. It was a bit confusing as you would expect to be watching about the problem with the environment but instead, you get snippets of Al Gore's life here and there. But over-all, the snippets seemed to provide a pause during which you have time to get yourself ready for another dollop of facts and figures. And I say dollop not chunk because the information was presented in a well thought out manner - simple, not rocket science terms were used, video was used judiciously to illustrate a process, graphs and charts were used judiciously as well. In other words, easily digestible.But it does pack a punch. In the space of 1 1/2 hours, you learn the official definition of global warming by watching how it happens, the effects of global warming on worldwide temperatures, marine life and other species, sea levels, hurricanes, human diseases. The impact is worldwide - anyone and everyone who is on this planet cannot escape the consequences. The impact is cumulative - if we sit on our butts and wait around, it may be too late when we finally wake up.As Melissa Etheridge's accompanying song puts it: 'I need to wake up... I need to shake up'. I was half expecting the movie to end with a doomsday tone so that it could really wake up and shake up people into doing something to reverse the trend. But instead, the movie ended on a positive note - we as a people in this day and age have the capacity to solve this problem; it's just a matter of perception on the individual level whether we think there's a problem or whether global warming is what God intended i.e. a natural phenomenon.It does boil down to the individual. But sometimes with problems like this which are on a massive-scale, a person can feel lost and not know where to start. The website tie-up can help: (...). It includes a link where you can 'Calcuate your personal impact' i.e. calculate how much carbon dioxide you are emitting into the atmosphere and how you can reduce your CO2 emissions. The suggestions may seem oriented toward those living in the U.S. so you may want to check local websites for more suggestions on how to help in this effort in your area. In Singapore, I've come across some recently published issues of magazines dealing with the environment namely 8 Days and Shape. There are very useful and localized tips and reminders in these.Other related websites you can explore:(...)Ok, what are you still sitting around reading this for?

It couldn't be more obvious that he's using his political skills to make complete suckers out of a very large non-scientific audience. It's not as though we can reasonably chalk up his campaign and the problems it creates to innocent error driven by good intention either. Behind this very serious politically driven environmental campaign are some extremely sinister motives defined by supporters of dictatorship and oppression. I urge any of his current supporters to begin paying more attention to the majority of scientists and their entirely credible representatives who have entered the public discussion to help educate the public. And - for crying out loud - get this junk out of the schools and deprogram the children who have already been exposed to it.	1.0	Political Propaganda	2007-12-09	24	8	16

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"It's impossible to say whether future generations will one day look back on Al Gore as ""the man who saved the planet,"" but they will at least be able to point to the documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth"" as the key factor in leading the ex-Vice President back from the political wilderness.Once an object of ridicule and scorn for many on both sides of the political aisle, Gore has recently achieved near-rock star status thanks largely to his unwavering commitment to awakening the people of  the world to the very-real dangers posed by global warming.  Armed with charts, graphs, photographs, and an unbridled passion that is truly infectious, Gore makes a convincing case in this film not only that global warming is indeed real but that if we don't act now to counter its influence, the world we live in will soon be a much less hospitable place in which to raise our kids and grandkids.  Given the evidence that has piled up over recent years backing his claims, it's hard for even the most cynical among us not to see Gore in oracular terms.""An Inconvenient Truth"" is essentially a big screen version of the sophisticated slide show that Gore has been presenting for years to largely sympathetic audiences.  What's most surprising, given his reputation for pomposity, condescension and stiffness, is just how relaxed, witty and avuncular Gore appears on screen as he ever so patiently and succinctly lays out material and data that could, in less capable hands, have come across as dry, arcane and incomprehensible to a less than scientifically literate lay audience.  The movie also shows how some of the events in his own personal life - the near-death of his son in an accident, the bitter loss of the election in 2000 - awakened Gore's consciousness and led him to educate himself and take the lead on an issue that has always meant so much to him.Like any good social crusader, Gore first raises public awareness of the problem then offers concrete steps that individuals, corporations and governments can take to help solve it.  With the spirit of a revivalist preacher, Gore implores everyone with a conscience to come together and do his part to eradicate the threat before it is too late for any of us to truly make a difference.Of course, the most common criticism leveled against the film is that it is little more than anti-capitalist leftwing propaganda, a slanted screed that provides only one side of the argument and that is essentially designed to make big business and the political right look like villains.  And, indeed, unlike in, say, a ""60 Minutes"" segment on the topic, director Davis Guggenheim does not provide equal time - or, to be honest, any time at all - to dissenting voices to make their case.  In fact, there are no interviews even with scientists who SUPPORT the claims being put forth by the film, a weakness that has allowed dissenters to charge Gore with playing fast and loose with the facts.  This has also led to the second most commonly stated criticism against the film, which is that it comes across at times like a vanity production designed more to rehabilitate Mr. Gore`s reputation than to make a legitimate scientific case for global warming.  I guess it would be possible to make such an argument against the movie, but the literature sure seems to back Gore on his assertions, and his commitment to the issue certainly comes across as both deep-seated and genuine.  He is, after all, no Johnny-come-lately to the scene, having devoted much of his adult life to the cause, long before it was trendy to do so.For most free-thinking, forward-looking people, ""An Inconvenient Truth"" will be both an eye-opening and a mind-opening experience.  For those who don`t fall into that category, it may soon be time to break out the surfboards and get ready to ride the waves down  5th Avenue."	4.0	taking the planet's temperature	2007-04-01	20	13	7

Orbin	"This movie misrepresents and edits the facts and only reports the information that backs up one side of the story while ignoring the information that completely contradicts every claim that it makes.I can't imagine how anyone with even a middle school science education could be fooled by the junk science used in this film but since so many people seem to have fallen for it I will detail more information below.(1)Near the beginning of the film, Gore pays respects to his Harvard mentor and inspiration, Dr. Roger Revelle. Gore praises Revelle for his discovery that atmospheric CO2 levels were rising and could potentially contribute to higher temperatures at a global scale. There is no mention of Revelle's article published in the early 1990s concluding that the science is ""too uncertain to justify drastic action."" (S.F. Singer, C. Starr, and R. Revelle, ""What to do about Greenhouse Warming: Look Before You Leap. Cosmos 1 (1993) 28-33.)(2) Gore discusses glacial and snowpack retreats atop Mt. Kilimanjaro, implying that human induced global warming is to blame. But Gore fails to mention that the snows of Kilimanjaro have been retreating for more than 100 years, largely due to declining atmospheric moisture, not global warming. Gore does not acknowledge the two major articles on the subject published in 2004 in the International Journal of Climatology and the Journal of Geophysical Research showing that modern glacier retreat on Kilimanjaro was initiated by a reduction in precipitation at the end of the nineteenth century and not by local or global warming.(3) Many of Gore's conclusions are based on the ""Hockey Stick"" that shows near constant global temperatures for 1,000 years with a sharp increase in temperature from 1900 onward. The record Gore chooses in the film completely wipes out the Medieval Warm Period of 1,000 years ago and Little Ice Age that started 500 years ago and ended just over 100 years ago. There is evidence from throughout the world that these climate episodes existed, but on Gore's Hockey Stick, they become nothing more than insignificant fluctuations (Gore even jokes at one point about the Medieval Warm period).(4) You will certainly not be surprised to see Katrina, other hurricanes, tornadoes, flash floods, and many types of severe weather events linked by Gore to global warming. However, if one took the time to read the downloadable ""Summary for Policymakers"" in the latest report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), one would learn that ""No systematic changes in the frequency of tornadoes, thunder days, or hail events are evident in the limited areas analysed"" and that ""Changes globally in tropical and extra-tropical storm intensity and frequency are dominated by inter-decadal and multi-decadal variations, with no significant trends evident over the 20th century.""(5) Gore claims that sea level rise could drown the Pacific islands, Florida, major cities the world over, and the 9/11 Memorial in New York City. No mention is made of the fact that sea level has been rising at a rate of 1.8 mm per year for the past 8,000 years; the IPCC notes that ""No significant acceleration in the rate of sea level rise during the 20th century has been detected.""(6) Near the end of the film, we learn of ways the United States could reduce emissions of greenhouse gases back to the levels of 1970. OK. Assume the United States accomplishes this lofty goal, would we see any impact on climate? The well-known answer is no. China, India and many other countries are significantly increasing their emission levels, and global concentrations of CO2 may double this century no matter what we decide to do in the United States. Even if the Kyoto Protocol could be fully implemented to honor the opening of this movie, the globe would be spared no more than a few hundredths of a degree of warming.In 1998, The Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine (OISM) issued a petition for signature by atmospheric scientists saying there is no scientific evidence indicating that human-created greenhouse gases are causing catastrophic global warming. That petition was signed by more than 17,000 scientists and leaders involved in the issue.Global Warming scaremongers have tried to discredit these statements from the opposition, saying either they are too old to be counted in today's debate or that they weren't signed by real scientists. Neither is true. One only has to look at the signers on the documents and statements to know who and what they are. The relevance of the documents can be answered in two ways. First, most of the signers of these documents from the 1990's hold the same positions today. Second, as is the fallacy in the Global Warming debate, such drastic climate changes, as described in the scaremongers diatribes, would not come about overnight. Though the proponents would have you believe otherwise, 15 years is but a microsecond in the study of the earth's activities.""An Inconvenient Truth"" is billed as the scariest movie you'll ever see. It may well be, but that's mostly because it is not an accurate depiction of the state of global warming science.Thank you to Dr. Robert C. Balling Jr. who is a professor in the climatology program at Arizona State University."	1.0	Inaccurate Depiction of the State of Global Warming Science	2006-12-30	190	122	68

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3BP0AVYR8BXX8	Roshan	Some of the people watching this film will (hopefully) be very keen to discern the scientific basis and evidence behind man-made global warming. However, this film only contains about two minutes of science and the rest is a hagiographic account of Al Gore plus some Apple product placement.The two minutes of science is 'Hi my name is Troy McClure-esque'. In fact, you could even argue that it is insulting to the viewer. It is then assumed from this piffle that you will accept man made global warming as scientific fact and the film continues with Al Gore's lecture.I watched the rebuttal of this film ('The Great Global Warming Swindle') prior to this and whilst I am aware of the fact that some of the contributors claimed they had been quoted out of context (possibly due to fear of a backlash) this film mentions actual scientific points which were never mentioned in Gore's film, although presumably many of these issues did exist when his film was made.The bottom line is that even if you believe global warming is man made that this film makes an incredibly poor attempt in proving this.	1.0	At best pseudoscience	2009-02-15	82	48	34

Secondly, I did not like Gore when he was in politics.  I was averse to seeing this documentary originally.  But, seeing his presentation intermixed with other video, along with his deep commitment, changed my mind.  He has changed considerably, and much to my surprise, in a very positive way.  I believe he clearly knows whereof he speaks and is quite eloquent in how he presents his views.  I'll probably be long dead before this becomes serious enough for governments to take action, but it concerns me greatly that my daughter, nieces, nephews, etc. will have to cope with such extreme global warming as portrayed in this film."	5.0	My two cents worth	2006-08-01	22	16	6

Fully 33 minutes of this video is spent doing nothing more than ""profiling"" Mr. Gore.  Showing him driving around with his Secret Service convoy of Chevy Suburbans (14 mpg) and spending time on his tobacco farm (tobacco kills 300,000 people in the USA annually.)  As the former Vice-President and Presidential candidate, that much time is just excessive, bordering on vanity while hoping you will miss the hypocrisy.And this is coming from someone who voted for him!Others will debate the merits of the science presented.

I feel sick hearing people say that we won't be long on this planet anyway so we it doesn't matter how we die off, and those that discredit science and talk about bad science (I'm a science educator). I found no bad science in this movie. Scientists are not going to collect ice core samples in the Antarctic and collaborate to change the data over the last 100 thousand years so that they can alarm others. A scientist's goal is to achieve truth, and understanding. I'm sure that every scientist out there would love to report that scientific evidence shows our environment is improving, and everything is peachy, no worries. People are saying that the Earth is so big that a little extra CO2 won't have any affect, but when you have 6 billion plus humans, competing for space and superiority at any cost, we end up with a big problem.People say this is a boring movie. I never saw it advertised as being entertaining. For me it is informative, intriguing, and really makes you think, and continue to think. I get the idea that many persons with low opinions of this movie have never seen it. They have an opinion and they are sticking to it.No, Al Gore is not a scientist as many of you point out, but he never claims to be.

Those who claim that this is ""junk science"" or ""liberal propaganda"" are mistaken; it is scholarly and measured in its tone and content.  Given the truth of its implications, what do we do about it?  The saddest effect of this film is that many businesses have sprung up, selling ""green"" products.  It's the entire culture of insatiable consumerism, combined with growing industrialization and overpopulation, which has brought us to this point.  Humanity's manner of living is ultimately unsustainable in the long term.  So how do we adapt? It is so much easier to simply claim that nothing has been proved, or that ""feel good"" measures like carbon credits actually bring relief.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A387BD735MI50R	R. Schultz	"Al Gore makes a compelling case here for the fact of global warming. Perhaps the most telling part of his presentation revolves around the ""before-and-after"" pictures he shows. He juxtaposes slides of snow-covered Alpine Mountains some decades ago with current slides showing them bare butte naked. There are similar contrasts with then-and-now Mt. Kilamanjaro, the Antarctic glacier cover, and many others.However Gore fails to present some information that might really galvanize viewers. Just after I saw this movie, I read an article that told how much carbon dioxide (the offending gas) is added to our atmosphere with each mile we drive, and with every hour he use some of the heavier duty utilities around our houses. It turns out that every auto commute, every airplane junket, adds more poundage of carbon dioxide to the air than is in the gas tanks of these conveyances. That's because the burnt carbon in the fuel combines with the oxygen in the atmosphere. The figures are astounding and Gore should have included them as a way of quantifying the damage done by casual energy use.Also, I suspect that Gore's real presentations in front of audiences include question-and-answer periods. The producers should have kept some of these exchanges in the movie. So many people have cried wolf, there's a lot of cynicism to overcome. The Paul Ehrlich catastrophists of the 70s did a tremendous amount of damage by predicting global famine and death by the year 2000 - predictions which patently didn't come true. Back then, some scientists were in fact warning of the coming catastrophe of a global ice age. They also had figures and slides to back up these predictions. The depletion of the ozone layer was blamed.At the very end of An Inconvenient Truth, Gore makes glancing reference to that ozone layer problem. He says we solved that - and so with the same sort of determined will, we may be able to avert global warming. Well, I don't know that anyone can be so blithely sure that the ozone problem is solved. The fact that Gore dismisses that aspect of the problem and doesn't specifically recognize and address those not-so-bygone alternative scenarios hurts his credibility a little.As it is, Gore does a fairly good job of issuing a wake up call. It's just that I felt a little more rigorous, inclusive treatment might prevent a lot of people from pressing the snooze button, turning on their electric blankets, and going back to sleep."	3.0	Will Warm You Up; May Not Bring You to a Boil	2007-03-20	7	2	5

In fact, ""An Inconvenient Truth"" is billed as the scariest movie you'll ever see. Could it be that life on Earth as we know it will end within the next 50 years? It did not take me long to feel that this may be the most important documentary of all time (and the scariest one)!In this documentary, Al Gore draws attention to the crisis of global warming. Gore blames CO2 for the temperature hikes we are experiencing worldwide. This documentary is basically a filmed version of the lectures that Gore has presented over 1,000 times to audiences all over the world.Gore left me no room for doubt regarding the reality of global warming as Earth's ultimate environmental crisis and eventual doom. I was fascinated and convinced by his thorough presentation. And I am not alone to feel this way. Here is what other reviewers on amazon.com have said about this documentary:A. A must see; a must think.B. The most important film I have ever seen.C. Very important; watch & watch again.D. What in the world are we waiting for?E. Required Viewing.F. Save this planet by individual action.G. Eye-opening!H. Al Gore is the smartest man on this doomed planet!I. Great inspiring movie. Please see it and let's change the way we live.J. The truth is very disturbing, but you need to see it.K. Don't Blow it! Good planets are hard to find.L. Spread the Truth.M. A must see for every resident of planet earth.N. Stunning! Seeing this film is one of the most important things you can do all year.O. Only 50 years from now... If you LOVE your CHILDREN, do you part to help NOW!Al Gore's message is quite clear: Our planet is dying due to the fact that the world is steadily getting warmer. The question is what does this mean for all of humanity and what can we do about it? This film argues the case that the effects of global warming will continue, and indeed steadily get worse.As I was reading the reviews on amazon.com, I found more and more people disagreeing with Al Gore. Some accused him of political manipulation. He is instilling fear in us in order for us to vote for him on the next presidential race. In other words, unless we vote for him, global warming is going to get worse and the icecaps are going to melt and we are all going to die by drowning!Some mistrust Gore. Some have exclaimed, ""Isn't this the guy who said he invented the internet!?"" Others believe that he is selling snake oil and that there is no truth in his claims. After all, they say, he is not a scientist. Shouldn't this documentary have been presented by a scientist? Furthermore, why did Gore not do something about Global Warming when he was vice-president and in a better position to do so?Many scientists in fact argue that his facts are not sound and that there is no correlation between CO2 and global warming.So which is it? Is Al Gore right and doomsday is within 50 years from now, or is this just an exaggeration and unsound science?Now I am not a scientist and am very new to this subject. With that said, here is the other side of the coin:(1) Gore says that Earth is heating up because of man-made pollutants, which are raising the level of CO2 in the air. This CO2 traps the radiated heat from the Earth, thus warming up our planet. However, not only is Earth heating up, but all of the other planets in the solar system as well. If this is so, then our man made CO2 emissions aren't the major reason for the heating of the planet. If you visit the NASA website, you'll see that the Martian ice caps are melting too! So what could be the reason for this global warming? The primary source of heat on Earth, or anywhere in our solar system, is the Sun. If it wasn't for the sun, Earth would be a ball of ice. Our Sun goes through cycles. The Earth warms or cools with increased or decreased solar activity in the sun. This is not hard to visualize since a slight change in the Sun's angle turns summer to winter or winter to summer, a difference of several degrees! Our sun could therefore be the main reason behind our global warming.(2) The earth has had many cooling and warming cycles for thousands of years, long before man could possibly contribute to it. The planet has seen far more severe climate changes than what we might experience and such changes have neither destroyed the planet nor the life upon it.(3) One volcanic eruption (such as Mt. Pinatubo's volcanic eruption in the 90's) causes far more pollution and Co2 gases than our industries. During the Gulf War in 1991, when Saddam Hussein set fire to the Kuwaiti oil fields, more pollutants had been released in the air in one go than in any other time in history.(4) We exhale CO2! Does this mean in order to have less CO2 in the air we must have less people on our planet? We are presently 6 billion people on Earth, and this number is rapidly increasing.(5) Sea level has been rising at a rate of 1.8 mm per year for the past millenniums. Many scientists believe that the worst case scenario is a 2 feet rise in sea level within the next 100 years! Gore believes that we will be seeing a sea level rise of 20 feet in the next 50 years.In a nutshell, no one really knows enough about the global climate to really say what definitively will happen within the next 50 years. In fact, no one really knows what the weather will be in the next few days (`This will be a sunny weekend,' exclaims the weatherman, only to have a rainy weekend).The best we can do is to listen to all sides of an issue and then come to an educated opinion of our own. We should not let others do the thinking for us. This doesn't mean we can keep polluting the air we breathe. Everyone should do their part in trying to keep the environment clean.I certainly enjoyed this movie and I think it's worth seeing. At least it got me thinking!"	5.0	You must watch it!	2007-01-26	0	0	0

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3B6D3A01L2AAD	"Sal Magnum ""refugee from Babylon"""	"First of all, I would like to preface my following comments with the statement that I am in full and complete backing of anyone who trully believes that mankind is causing severe damage to this planet and wants to facilitate a complete reversal of our destructive ways.All of you who have bought into Mr. Gore's philosophies, no doubt have your hearts in the right place. But knowing what I know, it would be incredibly irresponsible for me to support the ""band-aid on the bullet hole"" proposals promoted in this film.That said, here is the bombshell revelation, entirely controversial to some, but only because the truth has long been supressed, and most people today are simply ignorant of it through no real fault of their own. Whether or not you ""believe"" in global warming is inconsequencial. The truth is, that the man-made greenhouse gases caused from our current forms of energy harvestation and implementation (as well as a host of other industrial pollutants routinely unleashed on our envoirnment) are an unnecessary abomination.One has but to do a thorough historical study on Nikola Tesla and his remarkable discoveries and inventions to understand what has brought us to our current state of affairs.Tesla is known as ""The Father of the 20th Century"" and is regarded by those in the know, as the greatest scientist and inventor of all time, far surpassing, and in many cases directly contradicting the revered Edison and Einstein. Yet most of us learned little or nothing about him in our history books. This is no coincidence. Tesla cared little for monetary gain, but instead had a passion for using his technological discoveries to further the harmonious co-existance between Man and Nature. Some may know that he discovered the principles of alternative current (AC) and created the AC motor back in the late 1800's when Edison was still heavily invested in his direct current (DC) system. But Tesla had many other revolutionary ideas, most will go unmentioned here, (do your own research, I implore you) but his main idea was this; harness the natural electricity contained in the earth's magnetic field and the ionosphere in order to provide free wireless (i.e. clean) energy to the planet.Had Tesla been able to facilitate his ideas, the antiquated, dangerous, and polluting energy sources such as coal and petroleum would be completely unnecessary. Not to mention nulear power. When the atom was split in the early 1900's, Tesla was horrified and warned of the inherrent dangers and the horrible consequences for the earth and mankind such technology was sure to bring about.Now is where you ask how ""free wireless energy"" could possibly fulfill our incredible modern demands.First a little background info of great import. Of the many important inventions Tesla was never allowed to get to the masses, two stand out as being particularly key in this discussion. First was his Wardencliffe Tower which was an amazing forefather to the internet. This tower could wirelessly transmit photos, music and communications across the globe, BEFORE the turn of the 20th century! With this tower, Tesla planned to transmit free wireless electricity in full harmony with nature, the world over! (Research this please!)Also, in the 1930's, Tesla took the gasoline engine out of a Pierce Arrow, and replaced it with an electric motor. This motor was then powered by wireless electricity (not batteries) and easily achieved speeds in excess of 90 miles an hour! (see website [...] and click on the ""Tesla's Electric Car"" tab for more amazing info.)These inventions are quite incredulous indeed, especially considering how ""advanced"" we all think we've become technologically.Tesla's main problem, however, as I previously stated, was that he cared not for economic gain, (aside from that which enabled him to pursue his inventions and discoveries) yet he was dependant on the industrial investors of his day for financing. (Had he wished, he could have easily made trillions on his myriad of inventions crucial to the ""Industrial Age"".) J.P. Morgan (name sound familiar?) was the one who pulled the plug on the financing for Tesla's Wardencliffe Tower, once it was found out that there would be no way to meter this energy, thus no profit could be made. Morgan's infamous quote was, ""Tesla, if you had your way, the only thing we'd be able to sell is antennas!"" (Tesla's idea was that everyone would have their own antenna to stick into the ground to harness this free, clean, unlimited household electricity, and thus power all their household amenities and appliances, not to mention their vehicles.)In short, if things hadn't been sabotaged by the industrial capitalists and profiteers, our world today would be incredibly different. A virtual utopia where all modern technology worked seemlessly together, and was supported by its' envoirnment, instead of in direct opposition to it. We wouldn't be enslaved to the gas pump, our air would be clean and safe to breathe, and wars (which are fought over energy, let's not kid ourselves with patriotic falsehoods) would be completely unnecessary, as all earth's nations would be equal and there would be no ""have-nots"".Feel free to disagree, but please do your research first. Prove me to be a liar, if that be your motivation. Yes, find the truth, and it will set you free. Maybe someday we will have enough enlightened folks that we might be able to eradicate this unnecessary, antiquated and oppressive system. Escape slavery. Escape self-imposed retardation. Thanks for your attention. Now go and find the truth my brothers and sisters.

In essence, 'An Inconvenient Truth' is a call to action to fight against global warming.I first saw this movie at the cinema with some friends.

After watching this film, I can see what a brilliant politician Mr. Gore is, and how much he must have learned from working with Bill Clinton for 8 years.  That being said, Al Gore should be detested by the world for posing as a scientist in this film.Working for a world class non-profit research institution myself, alarms ring in my head the moment I see charts and slide presented in the manner if Mr. Gore.  These multimedia presentations that elicit a response based on impressing the senses rather than conveying scientific research in the form of scientific method.  I could refer you to countless web sites that demonstrate that the data he presents here is not sound scientific proof of global warming being caused by people.  That's not to say global warming is not caused by people, but I would take the skeptic side and say ""lets see some real science behind this that go beyond pretty but meaningless charts & graphs"".  Likewise, I do believe we should cut down on fossil fuel use, but not necessarily for the reasons conveyed by AG.  Rather, strategically, it seems more important to ween ourselves off our dependency of the oil cartel from a national security standpoint.I agree with other reviewers who resent the Academy for rewarding this type of film making (in the manner of in Michael Moore), rather than practicing good journalism/documentary making.  I would not consider myself a moderate, and find it deplorable that the Academy will favors films that have extreme left political agendas.On a side note, it is entertaining how every person Al Gore works with is his ""friend"", meaning he has millions of really tight buddies.  A person like you or me would probably refer to one of these as a colleague, since they aren't somebody we go and grab a beer with every Tuesday night.In all, this film is a joke; a funny one at that, so I give it 3 stars."	3.0	Excellent if you need a lesson on the science of rhetoric	2007-02-28	51	18	33

I dislike taking sides - liberal, conservative and so on, it is much better to stay in the middle, as it's the only way to get a full view of both left and right.Al Gore is not one of the most entertaining people in the world.  We can all agree on that.  So I was worried that it would take me several days of fighting sleep to see this documentary.  I am very happy that I was wrong.  Al Gore's presentation throughout the documentary was precise, well-delivered, non-argumentative, non-confrontational, not to mention educational, informative and downright interesting.Political sides aside, viewing this film about global warming with an open mind, one can not help but have their interest piqued.  All who blindly discount theories and presentations are not really open minded, hence their opinions are of little importance.  Little knowledge is a dangerous thing, it has been said, and Mr. Gore offered us a lot more knowledge in a concise format than we previously had.  None of the information that Mr. Gore presented is elusive - to the contrary, it is easily verified.  Naturally, in our research we would be better suited to consider scientific sources, as opposed to amateur ones.A fantastic, very informative film, ""An Inconvenient Truth"" is a must see for anyone who wants to be informed.  Look at the pictures, if nothing else, they really do say a thousand words each, and Mr. Gore presents the photographs very well indeed.  Hype?  Do we dare take a chance?  I wouldn't.

Especially the Director's and Producer's commentary - it wasn't made known during the movie that Al doesn't get paid for these slide shows he's been showing for years, and I think that's important from impartiality perspective.  Being from outside the US, politics there is viewed with such huge cynism, because it requires so much money to be a candidate, so you never feel you can trust a politician.  It's a shame that some of the commentary about Al personally wasn't in the original movie as it wasn't necessarily a good thing that it was him fronting it (for all the aforementioned reasons) from a foreign perspctive anyway.

We've switched all of our bulbs out to fluorescents. To me, it's all part of being pro-life, only pro-life for the planet. Landfills are overflowing, and we will someday run out of coal and oil. Besides, our dependence on foreign oil leads us into quagmires like the one in Iraq. So why not focus on renewable resources and on minimizing our footprint for future generations? It's just a practical and responsible thing to do.The thing I don't understand about the modern environmental movement is why it focuses so much on fear and doom. Politicians from both sides of the aisle seem to be using fear as their trump cards these days. On the right, it's fear of terrorism -- ""just hand over your Constitutional liberties, and we'll protect you."" And on the left, it's things like the environment -- ""the sky is falling."" Don't misunderstand: I'm glad that Al Gore is passionate about his cause. Maybe he can make more people think about the consequences of their daily actions. (Do you really need to drive that 10 MPG Hummer?) But his documentary doesn't focus on this aspect. Instead, it focuses on environmental catastrophe, jumps to lots of conclusions, deceptively frames several arguments, and ultimately says very little about what we can do to reverse course.One assumes, based on Gore's political track record, that his solution would be based in more government regulations. Instead of encouraging and empowering people to make their world a better place, and trusting them to make the right choices, people like Gore seem to think that the unwashed masses can't be counted on to do things right on their own. That patronizing attitude comes through in Gore's presentation. I'm sure he means well, but you never get the sense that he thinks people are responsible or smart enough to fix this problem on their own -- if it can be fixed at all. So you're left wondering what the point of it all is, other than a chance for Gore to do some grandstanding by flying around the world -- and burning up fossil fuels all along the way -- to wag fingers at people and push for more legislation.Are we in the midst of a man-made crisis? Gore seems certain that we are. And although I have no doubt that humans are having an impact on the environment, I also don't think current trends can be definitevely attributed to any particular cause. The environment goes through natural cycles of warming and cooling, and 1,000 years from now, scientists may look back and determine that this period was part of a natural fluctuation. Again, that's not to discount the problems we are currently seeing, and it's no cause for inaction or neglect. I simply think that Gore, like so many in the environmental movement, are too quick to place blame and too short on solutions."	2.0	Finger-wagging wins out over empowerment	2007-12-23	39	26	13

Al Gore is not saying anything new, but has merely packaged and presented the concept of 'global warming' very nicely. As a politician, that is his job.Now for the people who feel Global Warming is a farce, don't make your judgements based on what you feel is not right about this documentary, but on rather something more substantial. It highlights the lack of a deeper understanding of this issue at large.Its controversial, yes. It has industry/ economic ramifications, yes. But it cannot be overlooked or brushed aside.Now for the people who write reviews more as a political attack, well it is still your personal opinion. But taking into consideration that people like Al Gore highlight a ""sort-of"" correct issue on global warming than a person like Michael Moore who does his documentaries for 'personal growth'..??--Good Side, Bad Side, Ugly Side--  whatever side to this.

The film is very well done, seamless enough that I forgot I was watching a film.  He makes it personal enough for the viewer to relate to, yet it isn't about him or his agenda at all.  The most significant thing this film delivers is the message that every individual can change how they live to help the environment.  He doesn't even necessarily have to go into specifics of how to live; rather, it's the way he encourages his audience that every person counts, ever action counts.  Break out of the patterning and act.  In fact, one of the most memorable bits of it is not in the film at all, but at the end in the credits.  The animation of the credits recycles the letters into new phrases and names, and one of them re-arranges itself to say, ""If you believe in prayer, pray that people will find the strength to change.""

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3NP64G69X6OFP	S. Langley	"Many of the assertions Gore makes in his movie, ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' have been refuted by science, both before and after he made them. Gore can show sincerity in his plea for scientific honesty by publicly acknowledging where science has rebutted his claims.For example, Gore claims that Himalayan glaciers are shrinking and global warming is to blame. Yet the September 2006 issue of the American Meteorological Society's Journal of Climate reported, ""Glaciers are growing in the Himalayan Mountains, confounding global warming alarmists who recently claimed the glaciers were shrinking and that global warming was to blame.""Gore claims the snowcap atop Africa's Mt. Kilimanjaro is shrinking and that global warming is to blame. Yet according to the November 23, 2003, issue of Nature magazine, ""Although it's tempting to blame the ice loss on global warming, researchers think that deforestation of the mountain's foothills is the more likely culprit. Without the forests' humidity, previously moisture-laden winds blew dry. No longer replenished with water, the ice is evaporating in the strong equatorial sunshine.""Gore claims global warming is causing more tornadoes. Yet the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated in February that there has been no scientific link established between global warming and tornadoes.Gore claims global warming is causing more frequent and severe hurricanes. However, hurricane expert Chris Landsea published a study on May 1 documenting that hurricane activity is no higher now than in decades past. Hurricane expert William Gray reported just a few days earlier, on April 27, that the number of major hurricanes making landfall on the U.S. Atlantic coast has declined in the past 40 years. Hurricane scientists reported in the April 18 Geophysical Research Letters that global warming enhances wind shear, which will prevent a significant increase in future hurricane activity.Gore claims global warming is causing an expansion of African deserts. However, the Sept. 16, 2002, issue of New Scientist reports, ""Africa's deserts are in 'spectacular' retreat . . . making farming viable again in what were some of the most arid parts of Africa.""Gore argues Greenland is in rapid meltdown, and that this threatens to raise sea levels by 20 feet. But according to a 2005 study in the Journal of Glaciology, ""the Greenland ice sheet is thinning at the margins and growing inland, with a small overall mass gain."" In late 2006, researchers at the Danish Meteorological Institute reported that the past two decades were the coldest for Greenland since the 1910s.Gore claims the Antarctic ice sheet is melting because of global warming. Yet the Jan. 14, 2002, issue of Nature magazine reported Antarctica as a whole has been dramatically cooling for decades. More recently, scientists reported in the September 2006 issue of the British journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society Series A: Mathematical, Physical, and Engineering Sciences, that satellite measurements of the Antarctic ice sheet showed significant growth between 1992 and 2003. And the U.N. Climate Change panel reported in February 2007 that Antarctica is unlikely to lose any ice mass during the remainder of the century.Each of these cases provides an opportunity for Gore to lead by example in his call for an end to the distortion of science. Will he rise to the occasion? Only time will tell.Above is from the Chicago Suntimes.Gore said he invented the internet and made many other typical-of-a-politician claims.The earth's climate has fluctuated for thousands and thousands of years. Are we to suppose that today's climate is THE perfect range for us humans as opposed to the climate of 500 years ago or 1000 years ago?Global warming has been occuring since the end of the last ice age.Buy an electric car and save the planet.

Let me say this first:  An Inconvenient Truth attempts to convince you that a) global warming is a hideous problem and that b) humans are the cause.Why would a documentary based upon a scientific theory need to convince?  If, for instance, the proposed theory and supporting evidence suggested that smiling makes people happy, only a bare report of the facts would be necessary, right?  Well, with global warming, making a passionate case is absolutely necessary because of a deliberate effort on the part of large industries and politicians who support them to confuse the facts - to lie to the public.  Because this issue has been politicized, the makers of this documentary have mixed Al Gore's presentation with his personal story, not to sell Al Gore as a man but to add needed emotion to the story of global warming.  They do it well.  If An Inconvenient Truth alarms its viewers, then it is doing a public service.Very entertaining as well as informative.

The problem here is that it is completely one sided, thus making this not a documentary at all, but rather propaganda.  True documentaries are non-biased.As for the subject matter, there are flaws throughout the film when concerned with accuracy.  And given that this is a man who does NOT practice what he preaches, then it's very difficult to take what he's saying seriously.  Plus there are way too many conflicting scientists who debate the validity of Human caused global warming.  Gore just writes the opponents off and boldly states that his info is ""fact"".

For those still confused by the science, and, just as importantly, the agendas, regardless of your politics, take a couple of hours to see this documentary. This is not the wooden Al Gore of the 2000 Presidential campaign, but a man who, having freed himself of political obfuscation, impassioned by a need to save, quite literally, human civilization, has distilled the complex and provable science of climate change into a remarkably clear and compelling multimedia presentation that even a child can comprehend.

The movie concludes that we can overcome the global warming if we use renewable energy, drive hybrid car, and turn down air conditioning. Al Gore shows in graph each of these activity will cut CO2 emission increase by like 10% and added together CO2 emission will decrease. But no proof that any of these activity will cut emission by any where close to 10% was ever given. In the end this movie reduces only to fear mongering using exaggerated computer generated graphics.	3.0	Maybe the earth will balance out	2007-06-19	7	2	5

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2XRH5T1BU29H3	Spencer Howson	"I think it was Michael Moore (""Fahrenheit 9/11"") who inspired me to start watching long-form documentaries.  Now they've become something of a hobby.  From ""Supersize Me"", ""Outfoxed"" and ""The Big One"" to ""How's Your News"", ""The Aristocrats"" and ""Bowling For Columbine"".  Aside from the obvious educational benefits of watching docos, they've become more contemporary and adventurous and are therefore more entertaining.  The other thing I love about documentary feature films is that, unlike an ""Out of Africa"", you don't have to see them on the big screen!  You can watch them at home on DVD, over two or three sittings if you want.Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" is a 100 minute ""slideshow"" - his description - on  carbon emmissions and the greenhouse effect.  The former American Vice President has been lecturing about global warming since losing office six years ago.  He's spoken in over a thousand locations around the world, passing on a warning given to him thirty or more years ago.The facts are compelling and disturbing.  As Al Gore puts it, in the 50-odd years that he (and other ""baby boomers"") has been on the planet, the rate of carbon dioxide emissions and global warming have shot through the roof, our ice-caps and glaciers have started melting, our forests are burning, our rainfall patterns changing, our sea levels warming, severe weather becoming far too common.  And, in a worse-case scenario, Al Gore predicts Planet Earth could descend into another ice age within ten years!  Guess whose fault it is.Ultimately, Al Gore shows we can reverse the trend as long as we (and politicians) start to acknowledge the ""Inconvenient Truth"".  As I left the cinema, I wanted to get started straight away.  I felt like phoning someone - anyone - to warn them and to get them to change their ways.So, it is a powerful documentary.  It does have an effect on you.  But, to be completely honest, it is just a slideshow presentation, in what appears to be a university lecture theatre, albeit with additional commentary by Al Gore.  You won't hear anyone saying ""You must see it on the big screen""!  My recommendation:  wait till it comes out on DVD, buy or rent it, get some mates together for a ""slideshow"" at your place, then pass it on."	4.0	Watch the DVD, then pass it on!	2006-08-25	16	8	8

When I first saw the trailer to 'An Inconvenient Truth', I laughed at the way the movie was hyped, yet was nothing more than a lecture by Gore.Gore's lecture was absolutely amazing. He painted a clear picture of the global warming problem in an apolitical manner. The facts backed up by imagery and research were very convincing that we are in danger.It is unfortunate that 'An Inconvenient Truth' will not reach a wide audience, or reach those that should see it the most. Gore is a political creature, and therefore he will not reach about 50% of the population.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1RLU5BZI9L1XR	Stephen E. Gruber	"The former ""Vice"" President jumps from junk philosophy (his commentary on Rene' Descates in his first book was hilarious and thoroughly entertaining)to junk science in his convenient ""documentary"" which indeed should net enough money as an Academy Award winner to defray the $30-thousand per year electric bill for his mansion. But that's inconvenient to bring up here. True, as one reviewer on this site observed, Gore is truly ""passionate,"" however, pure passion alone without a fair treatment of the evidence is just that, passion, and hardly inductive reasoning (I hear Aristotle throwing up). I have taught philosophy and statistical analysis at university, and Gore makes more mistakes than what can be assessed here. Two immediate logical fallacies are (1) the vast fluctuations in the earth's climate occurred in prerecorded humankind history which hundreds of scientists on the ""other"" side of the issue have weighed in on, yet somehow are conveniently evaporated from this ""documentary"", and (2) even if the United States signed the Kioto treaty, yea, this would have absolutely no impact on the current situation of carbon emissions, acid rain, and other contaminants worldwide. If countries such as China, Indonesia and other key players don't sign up for the Program and, more importantly, actually follow through with a demonstrable policy of accountability that can be objectively measured by outside sources, then the whole notion that any combined effort will have any impact on Planet Green is utterly laughable. In addition, Gore is sententious -- a pompous and moralizing egomaniac who apparently needs something to occupy his time with, so why not pontificate on how we Americans are using and abusing the earth. I would hope that the thankfully ""former"" Vice president and ""former"" presidential candidate will take his new science fiction apokalypto to, say, China, or to Indonesia, or to India, or to Russia, or better yet, the formerly pro-American, pro-military gulag known as Hollywood. He is good at raising money for the Democrat coffers and should be able to enlist his superior intellectual buddies such as Thetan Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, what's-her-name, er, Barbra Streisand, to mention a few. I would give a grade of a mercy C-plus for this ""documentary"", and a combined IQ of a generous 40 for content, and a straight A for bells and whistles. But none of this really matters, you see, when we all feel so, well...passionate!  I look forward to ""Inconvenient Truth Part II: The Search for More Money.""

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2KA60QZUBJ6OH	Stephen Eutsey	This is a fascinating documentary jam-packed with information. Topics range from how they can figure out what the average temperature was of a given region back in, say, 1150 - to the accuracy of predictions made in the 1960s concerning the present and the film makes, based upon research, some exceedingly alarming predictions about the future. There is speculation (such as what the world map will look like when / if glaciers in Greenland and the Ant-Arctic melt), but it is couched in numbers and research. The presentation is very literate and to me, there is one thing missing. You hear a lot about what Al Gore did and said prior to becoming VP and what he has been saying and doing since he was VP, but you interestingly don't hear about what he or the Clinton administration did for the environment while he WAS VP. In place of that is a scanty, general defense of Kyoto and a very short blurb about Florida 2000, which is more than a little out of place. Still, it does a great job staying on topic and goes by rather quickly for 96 minutes. Gore displays a sense of humor and has a comfortable presentation style.The presentation is basically a bells-and-whistles-laden power point presentation Gore gives to an audience in a mostly darkened lecture hall on a massive screen. It is interrupted for narrative flow with bits and pieces about Gore's life, home, etc. and includes some stock footage. It is never boring, especially if you are interested in the topic, which, I think, we all should be. Gore's case should be quite compelling, even to those not sure of the degree of human involvement in global warming.	5.0	Fascinating	2007-03-24	12	5	7

For Democrats, you'll love every minute.I bought this because of one question: How does a former VP present such a controversial topic in a hollywood movie?Gore did great.  It's no Armagaeddon, and his presentation in real life is obviously longer, and more extensive of the critiques to global warming, but he recognizes the limited attention span of the public and carefully chooses the evidence that provides no doubt to the discussion of global warming.Some clips of Gore's personal life appear.  He was against it b/c like any  average person you would look selfish and ruin the credibility of the movie's message.  However, it was the director that said it was critical for an effective story.  So don't worry about it.I used this for a leadership workshop in UC Davis.  THE BEST PART is Gore's interest in NOT presenting numbers BUT RATHER EXPLAINING THE PROCESS, AS INDIVIDUALS, TO LET THE WORLD WORK AND THINK IN A BETTER WAY.  It's entertaining, unique, and a rare opportunity to watch a public figure direct his passion into a wonderful movie!	5.0	Credible, Clear, and Very Important	2007-02-15	10	6	4
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2VP7JOT3K7PFM	"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie"""	"""Out of 925 recent articles in peer-review scientific journals about global warming, there was no disagreement [that it is occurring].  Zero.""The above is just one of the facts you will learn from viewing this Academy Award-winning, riveting, easy-to-understand, and surprisingly non-boring documentary about climate change, specifically global warming.  It features former U.S. vice-president Al Gore standing on a stage before a large screen lecturing to an audience.Generally, Gore reviews:(1) the scientific evidence for global warming (he has access to many scientists)(2) the politics of global warming(3) the economics of global warming(4) its consequences (those happening now and those that are predicted)There seems to be some confusion as to what exactly the contents of this film entails.  To alleviate this problem, I will give the title of each scene below and where I feel it is necessary, a comment in parenthesis:(1)  The river (this is one item in an introductory sequence)(2)  Continental drift (at one time major land masses were together but slowly drifted apart)(3)  Basic science of global warming (""traditional explanation"")(4)  Global warming cartoon (""better explanation"")(5)  Professor Revelle (first person who proposed to measure carbon dioxide (a major culprit causing global warming) concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere.  Gore attended classes given by Revelle)(6)  Carbon Dioxide measures since 1958(7)  Glaciers receding (around the world)(8)  Ice cores (can be used to measure carbon dioxide concentrations for a particular year in the past)(9)  Carbon dioxide levels back 650 thousand years(10)  *Albert's accident (Gore's son)(11)  Rising temperatures(12)  Hurricanes (as well as tornadoes and typhoons)(13)  *2000 election (Gore versus Bush)(14)  Precipitation and Evaporation (these are increasing and relocating due to global warming)(15)  *The Gore farm(16)  The Arctic (predictor of global warming)(17)  The ocean conveyer (responsible for heat transfer)(18)  *Resistance to change (humans find it difficult to change their ways)(19)  Troubling signs (of global warming)(20)  Antarctica (another predictor of global warming)(21)  Sea-level rise(22)  *China (contrary to what you may hear, China is doing its part to curb global warming)(23)  (Human) population explosion (puts pressure on Earth's resources)(24)  Old habits + new technology (= dramatically altered consequences)(25)  *Working tobacco(26)  Is there (really) a controversy (with regard to global warming)?  (Gore talks about skeptics who want to ""reposition global warming as a debate"")(27)  Science fraud (just like that which perpetuated the myth that smoking cigarettes does not cause lung cancer)(28)  Balancing the economy and environment (or money versus the Earth)(29)  *City by city (Gore goes to cities around the world with his message)(30)  The solutions are in our hands (to solve the problem of global warming)(31)  Are we (humans) capable of doing great (environmental) things?(32)  Our only home (the planet we call------EARTH)(*These items are personal in nature.)Gore is an engaging person thus making this documentary (on a serious subject) a treat to watch.  The pictures, graphs, animation, etc. that appear on the screen behind Gore are well done and illustrate exquisitely each point he's making.The accompanying book of the same title is more detailed than the documentary.  The book reached #1 on the New York Times bestseller list in July 2006.The film's distributor, ""Paramount Classics,"" is donating 5% of the box office receipts and Gore is donating all his proceeds from this film to ""The Alliance for Climate Protection.""  Also, this was the third highest documentary at the U.S. box office (at the time this review was written).Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2006) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has many interesting extras.In conclusion, I want to leave you with the words of the late, great Dr. Carl Sagan that I feel summarize Al Gore's fascinating documentary:""Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark.  [To see that the Earth is truly a ""speck,"" refer to the picture of the Earth as seen from about 3.5 billion miles by the Voyager 1 spacecraft.  Gore includes this astonishing picture both in this documentary and his book.]  In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.The Earth is the only world we know so far to harbor life.  There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which [the human] species could migrate.  Visit yes.  Settle, not yet.  Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we must make our stand.""(...)"	5.0	"""Consensus as the one that has developed around [global warming] is rare in science"""	2007-03-27	19	9	10

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2UR4ZJF6L0BUW	Steve	15,000 years ago most of the northern hemishere was covered in ice, sea levels were 300 feet lower and huge deserts formed due to a lack of rainfall.  Such ice ages occurred many times.50,000,000 years ago the poles had melted and tropical fish were swimming aound the north pole.Humanity may indeed be causing global warming and such a warming may indeed have consequences for human convience, but to imply the planet is threatened with descruction is fear mongering.  The planet has seen far more severe climate changes than what we might experience and such changes have neither destroyed the planet nor the life upon it.Humanity has a tremendous capacity to adapt and any climate changes will happen slow enough that we can adapt to them.  So we have to move beach houses or plant crops in new areas, does any thinking person really belive that we can't handle such changes and that humanity will drown becouse we are too stupid to avoid seas that rise by a few centimeters per year?  Give me a break.The real agenda behind Gore's tirade to create fear.  Liberals love to create fear, it is one of their power bases.  Just listen to NPR, one fear story after another.  Oh woe is us!  The planet is dying!  It's all our fault!  It's all Bush's fault!All this handwringing is simple political manuvering.  The liberals want to create fear and then use that fear to obtain votes.

From the slant of many of these reviews, it would seem the case.  This reviewer finds Mr. Gore to be one of the dullest of presenters but have to admit he makes a compelling case.  Political sound-bytes cannot discredit the evidence.  Watch it whether you happen to agree with his political views or not and see how your eyes might be openned to another side.Mr. Gore does a good job of defining the problem.  My own view is that there is indeed a problem but I fear Mr. Gore's solutions would be more government involvement and I think that would only make matters worse.  It is government involvement now in the form of protecting American businesses that has caused part of the problem.  Further government intervention in the free market will likely only make it worse.  The problem is real, the solution is what seems to illude us.  Yet, at least Mr. Gore is willing to be the voice of one crying in the wilderness rather than burying his head in the sand and pretending not to see.  Give him his due, watch the movie, learn from those with whom you may not entirely agree.  Then consider what the solution might be and let it guide your vote.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1K3NQAO49LXL2	"Surferofromantica ""S.O.R."""	"No, this is not Jane Austen or Merchant Ivory, this is Al Gore. The big, sweaty man has come back and traveling the world with his message, he's also staring intently at the screen of his Mac Powerbook. He does one thing very well in this movie: he shows that industry is producing a great deal of CO2, and then he correlates a rise in CO2 with a rise in average global temperatures; this is part of the here and now, the world today. He also paints interesting scenarios of what this might mean for the world, any of which is very scary indeed. But as he disingenously points out, thousands of peer-reviewed scientific reports have been written to prove that global warming is a real phenomenon, while none have been written to debunk it. In other words, there was no reason to make this film, other than to give a voice to the scientific community by a well-known non-politician (since there are no longer any well-known scientists except cranks with agendas like Richard Dawkins). More interesting to me is the structure of the film and the way it influences (or manipulates) the viewer. One scene where he is hinting that the last devastating global crisis that the world faced was the one that Winston Churchill warned about in 1932 is followed after a long pause by one where he talks about losing the White House to George Bush. He is juxtaposing mentions of Nazis with comments on the current Washington administration. Sneaky, or just plain brilliant? He also makes his story even more personal by finding ways to make relevant to the narrative two family crises: the car accident that nearly claimed the life of his son and the cancer that robbed him of his beloved sister. While I'm not sure what they have to do with global warming, it does make the story tender. And when Al shifts from being a sad sack ""the next president of the United States"" to being an inspirational firebrand, you know that the film is over."	5.0	Bigger than the President	2008-12-24	11	2	9
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A15B6KEZ0CM3KL	"surfin' ma ""KT"""	"Al Gore and his politically correct film An Inconvenient Truth is full of hot air and Scare Science~!  This film is full of one-sided ""scientific"" facts about global warming that are simply meant to be used as a political tool to bankrupt large, prosperous countries like the USA.  REAL science has not proven global warming is caused by humans----what it does prove is that climate change in itself is a normal process and is dependant on the sun and the normal cycles of sunspots that occur on it.  Al Gore is such a huge, hot-air-filled windbag and incredibly egotistical to assume that human activity is to blame for GLOBAL climate change---and even to assume that humans have ANY effect on weather!  Think about it----have we EVER been able to stop a hurricane---stop winter---stop any natural weather phenomenon???  Ask yourself how Leif Ericksson navigated the Northwest passage, landed on a green Greenland and even grew grapes there???  How did ancient Britain grow wine grapes on their island????  I believe it was WARMER----as in global warming that was warmer than our hottest summers now!  They didn't even have cars or factories----so I guess according to Al Gore and his Greenie cohorts---it must have been farting cows.....................Knowing history and both sides of the story is the only way to avoid being swayed by propaganda---which is all An Inconvenient Truth is........."	1.0	Hot Air anyone??..................	2007-02-16	57	22	35
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2TFWLHE25JD06	Surrounded	"Accepting the conventional wisdom on climate change requires that one follow a strict chain of logic.  A break at any point in the chain negates the final conclusion.1.  The earth's average temperature is rising.2.  The correlation between atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and the rise in temperature, is causative.3.  Carbon dioxide levels are rising as a result of human industrial activity.4.  Therefore, by altering human activity to lessen the production of carbon dioxide, global warming may be  mitigated.I have left out other assumptions, such as the potential effects of rising temperature.  These are the arguments against these points:1.  The average rise in temperature is so slight as to be meaningless; data on average temperature in the past is within the margin of error.  The apparent rise may be a function of more precise, and more widespread, recent observation.2.  The apparent correlation between atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and the rise in temperature is coincidental, or the result of a third factor.3.  Carbon dioxide levels have risen in the past, before humans existed.4.  Industrial activity, including the use of fire, would have to cease completely in order to have a meaningful effect on global warming.  Since water vapor is the primary greenhouse gas, even ending carbon dioxide production completely would have no effect.Any one of these objections, if valid, demolishes the global warming model.  Another issue concerns our responsibility for climate change.  As a living organism, humans are bound to affect the environment by their activity.  The belief that we are obligated to minimize our negative impact probably arises from the Biblical passage naming Man as the ""steward of the earth.""  This belief is now ingrained into our culture, and is shared by many atheists as well as religious persons.  But it is a cultural assumption, not a law of nature.  The purely practical argument is that humanity has the power to consciously alter its behavior to maximize the potential for long-term survival over short-term comfort.My concern is that the topic of global warming has become simply another polarizing argument, with liberals demanding ""action"" and conservatives dismissing it as nonsense.  Legitimate scientific inquiry is rarely discussed, as any conclusion is automatically assumed to be biased in favor of one side or the other.  Instead, the Democrats are paying lip service to the idea while the Republicans complain about more restrictions on business.  Regardless of whether or not human activity is causing climate change, if it is indeed happening, the best course of action would be to prepare for its effects, rather than arguing about the motivations of each side in the debate."	3.0	Another Polarizing Argument	2008-01-25	15	10	5

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A256QKS1DIQ54U	T. Bollinger	AIT is a documentary that throws a lot of information at you in quick succession, and it mostly succeeds at packaging that info into easily digestible sizes. However, the main parts of the doc (other than the interesting little autobiographical bits about Gore) are little more than a glorified taped college lecture. What I mean by what&#8217;s bad about this is that AIT is fairly limited in how much it can impress and convince.For another thing, if one comes into this doc already knowing most or all of the baseline information presented, AIT does little to further illustrate or expand upon this information. As I was one of those informed people, I was basically unaffected by this film. Now that&#8217;s not to say that this is not an important film for the UNinformed (of which there are many), I&#8217;m just pointing out that this information was very easily accessible to the general public before AIT&#8217;s release, as opposed to, say, the information presented in &#8216;Food Inc.&#8217; But then again, we have known for a long time that our food is really over-processed and pumped full of artificial ingredients, so I&#8217;m not sure.In any case, the fact that &#8216;Truth&#8217; is basically a recorded lecture is the main thing holding it back. I stand by my statement that the only way to effectively, and OBJECTIVELY, rate the value of a documentary is to analyze and decide how well it communicates its message, NOT the actual content that it presents. I for one am one of those many people who is on Al Gore&#8217;s side (really, I&#8217;ve been aware of this stuff for years prior to this), and I am glad that AIT has garnered some attention. Really, the issue of global climate change has always been analogous to and of similar importance to the Law of Evolution and Natural Selection from my point of view. I accept natural selection as a fact and fundamental umbrella concept of all biology (I never refer to it as a &#8220;theory&#8221;), and quite frankly, I find it laughable and ludicrous how much of the general population knows close to nothing about natural history and/or flat out rejects Darwin&#8217;s works, and the research of countless other brilliant scientists. I accept natural selection and evolution as facts because they are. We used to believe that the earth was the center of the universe and that the sun revolved around the earth, and look where that got us. Climate change means the same thing to me &#8212; it&#8217;s obviously happening and its obviously anthropogenic to a large extent. So I hope it&#8217;s clear my criticisms of Al Gore&#8217;s signature work are not biased against his particular viewpoints (which really should not be considered that controversial &#8212; AT ALL).The problem is that AIT is mostly a bore to watch. I really can&#8217;t imagine many people who are not already scientifically or environmentally inclined becoming very interested or invested in this documentary. Strictly speaking, if your documentary can&#8217;t connect with or convince anyone who is not already aware of most or all the factual information in your project, than your work really isn&#8217;t much of a success now is it? A fair number of documentaries with important messages get overlooked due to a lack of marketing or effective advertising, and yet there are a larger number of docs, a lot that activists rant and rave about, that don&#8217;t produce a lot of change because they simply were not that well made. They couldn&#8217;t convince audiences of, or at least make people interested in considering, the filmmakers&#8217; stance on an issue. Documentaries like &#8216;Home,&#8217; &#8216;Food Inc,&#8217; &#8216;Bully,&#8217; and &#8216;Waiting for Superman&#8217; that are championed by liberal activists as the second coming of the Enlightenment fail to generate much change at all because they can&#8217;t connect with any group outside of those who already agree with them. They may have had thought-provoking, or even terribly important messages, but they stumbled on the most important aspect of documentary film-making: Communication. They failed to deliver the message effectively. Congratulations on bringing your urgent message to the populace, activists, nobody cares!This is why I always thought that documentary film-makers like Morgan Spurlock and Michael Moore are criminally underrated because they actually manage to get their point across part of the time. Hardcore activists and wannabe revolutionaries scoff at them because everybody&#8217;s heard of them and their docs are usually very popular &#8212; which is incredibly ironic since that that is the entire goal of documentaries with political messages! Sure, &#8216;Fahrenheit 9/11&#8242; didn&#8217;t result in the impeachment of Bush, but everybody saw it and was talking about it, and it&#8217;s the highest grossing documentary of all time. And I don&#8217;t really need to reference how McDonald&#8217;s conveniently ditched the &#8220;Super Size&#8221; option a mere six weeks after Spurlock&#8217;s fast food experiment debuted, do I?I understand that many well-made docs don&#8217;t get the attention and opportunity to initiate change simply because they don&#8217;t have the resources to sell themselves, but for all the documentaries you do hear left-wingers raving about, all of the reasons they fail to do anything meaningful as far as social change is concerned has to do with the fact that they really are not that good. Viewers who are already in the same boat as those docs&#8217; film-makers tend to love documentaries like the ones I mentioned, because people like listening to others who agree with them and share their views. This, I adamantly argue, is a fundamentally flawed approach to evaluating documentary films due to the fact that it is inherently biased. It unfortunately seems to be shared among a lot of prominent doc artists because most politically charged documentaries fail to gain much momentum at all. I know I spent like 45,000 words or so bitching about how the film industry is so screwed up because its so dependent on money and profits, but honestly, in a genre of film-making that is not based on a fictional narrative, a well-defined script, and is supposed to be made up of real life footage and facts, documentarians could actually afford to sell out a little bit. Yes, I did in fact just say those words. I am as surprised as you are. I feel like too many &#8220;artistic&#8221; film-makers are preoccupied with the idea that their message is so important that people will instantly care about it&#8230;just because of its importance alone. Sadly, that is not how the world works. In today&#8217;s society (and I would argue, throughout all human history), you have to be able to sell your message effectively, otherwise all your efforts and valuable insight will be for nought.Where most unsuccessful documentaries fail is in their tone. For the most part, a lot of controversial docs are either really preachy and condescending, treating their audiences or people who disagree with them like idiots or panning them as morally corrupt, or they convey their information in a totally uninteresting way. AIT thankfully doesn&#8217;t dabble much in the former, but it can definitely be considered a case study of the latter. All things considered, AIT is hopelessly boring and devoid of humor of any kind. In a documentary whose theme regards the changing climate bringing about waves of disease and crop failures and the general end of the world, it would have been really smart to include something like comic relief along the way. But, you know, we gotta be serious, because climate change is a serious issue. And if we are talking about and showing serious messages to audiences, that means they will automatically care about them.Well no, not really at all.That&#8217;s my main problem with Al Gore and his ManBearPig, I mean global warming, emergency. It is so dull and uninteresting that several times during the viewing I caught myself starting to fall asleep in my seat. Really, the emotional high point of the doc is when Gore makes a halfway decent joke about the health and stability of the planet vs. corporate/economic interests and moneymaking. This is more or less the only bit of Gore&#8217;s spiel that I can recall, because the rest of it blurred together as yet another lackluster college lecture I had to sit through. I actually found the autobiographical bits about Gore&#8217;s past to be far more interesting than the actual message about climate change because I feel like I can relate to the man&#8217;s personal trials and tribulations, and the footage is more varied than a couple cameras following some guy giving a speech on stage. These small snippets of personal information about Gore are way more fun to watch since we have a personality to connect with and the visuals are more creative than, well, nothing.Activists who follow controversial stories like AIT, &#8216;Food Inc,&#8217; &#8216;Home,&#8217; and others need to realize that just because those films mirror their own opinions does not necessarily make them good. At all. The reason being is that you, the environmentalists, intellectuals, and social activists are not the target audience that those documentaries are trying to reach. The end goal of films like &#8216;Waiting for Superman&#8217; is not to pat each other on the back and remind ourselves how much better society would be if everyone thought like us, rather the goal is to get other people who don&#8217;t necessarily agree with us to see things from our point of view. To affect change, great documentaries must be able to communicate and relate to people who do not share their views. This means not coming across as excessively preachy or sporting a holier-than-thou attitude, and this also means not being a complete snoozefest to watch. Activists typically don&#8217;t realize or acknowledge these flaws because they are too caught up in the high of watching a multi-million dollar production that sees the world in the same way they do. I&#8217;m gonna quote the only good line from &#8216;Avatar&#8217; and remind everyone that, &#8220;It is hard to fill a cup that is already full.&#8221;So no, I didn&#8217;t really care for or like &#8216;An Inconvenient Truth&#8217; much at all. I could tell even by the condescending title that things were a little off. Once the film opened with Gore standing in a lecture hall in front of a bunch of college-age kids with a projector screen behind him, I got even more worried, but I thought that maybe the class hall setting might serve as skeleton outline for the real documentary stuff. Sadly, that was not the case. The fact that this thing won an Academy Award for Best Documentary (which is a joke category to begin with) makes no sense to me, and it should in no way count as an argument for AIT&#8217;s quality. As Matt Stone and Trey Parker pointed out, it wasn&#8217;t even a documentary, &#8220;It was a PowerPoint presentation.&#8221;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;SCORE: 4/10+ Gore does a nice &#8220;big picture&#8221; intro; autobiographical bits are surprisingly interesting.- AIT as a whole is just boring through and through. It does not even try to be the slightest bit interesting or memorable in its presentation. There is no reason for any viewer to be invested in the subject matter, except for those who are already aware of the gravity of the situation at hand. In that respect, AIT fails as a thought-provoking documentary in every way possible.- The &#8220;documentary setting&#8221; in a lecture hall has to be one of the worst ideas I have ever seen in a major political documentary.? I certainly don&#8217;t hate Gore for trying to raise awareness for an important cause &#8212; really, it&#8217;s one of the most important issues we should be talking about today. But if our ol&#8217; VP is gonna be both the leader and poster boy for the movement, then we are in serious trouble.	2.0	'An Inconvenient Truth' (2006): Review	2013-03-08	4	4	0

Sorry Al Gore, the only green you're interested in is the green backs going into your bank account you hypocrite, and that's a fact.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A6I0PLKE9MS99	T. Greer	I was not surprised by this DVD at all!  Our world is slowly dying, like a cancer unless we help to do something about it.  I am an advocate because I could see the change just in my own life (of 46 years). I can remember summers at our house at the Jersey shore!  Many fun-filled summers where the air was cool, through the day and at night.  We never once needed to turn on an air conditioner.  In the past 10 years, we began to notice it was warm at night, we were unable to get air into the house nor was it good sleeping weather.  In the past 5 years, we purchased air conditioners (window units).  We felt cramped in, claustrophobic.  No more was there that wonderful breeze for a chat on the porch or a walk on the beach.  We also noticed there are no more gullys that used to form on the beach surf that formed during the middle of the day and where we used to dig for huge clams!  I have noticed all of this and attribute it to global warming.  I want to do something now and I am!  You should, too!	5.0	We Need To Act Now!	2007-04-15	12	4	8

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A24L13Q1GJAS6U	"The Cruelly Mad Emperor Caligula ""Little Boots"""	"As some of you may know (though it'd be impossible to miss considering the lib media's all over it), Gore recently won the questionable Nobel Peace Prize for his manipulative work on climate change, climate change which, ironically enough, is totally debunked as being manmade in Chris Horner's masterpiece, the Politically Incorrect Guide To Global Warming. As a result of Gore's doubtful win--mainly by a Nobel committee which is ideologically leaning to the left by far--this has boosted his visibility and also that of the products he hawks, such as this Inconvenient Truth DVD. However, this is where I come in.I'm concerned about folks getting ripped off by a charlatan such as Gore, especially now when Democrats are unrelentingly moaning and charging that real income's down despite Bush's tax cuts. So, my review is expressly intended as a caution, a warning and an alert for all the gullible consumers out there who may misjudge and unwisely buy this DVD just because of Gore's political/ideological Nobel win.What many of you impressionably gullible people may not know about Gore's DVD is that the REAL, INCONVENIENT TRUTH is an English judge recently ruled that Gore's propaganda-film is not science but political, emphasizes alarmism and exaggeration over science, and now should come with a disclaimer for teachers to balance Gore's partisan opinions. This is what you indiscriminate and submissive customers are buying when you actually give your hard-earned money to Gore's propaganda: not a film based on facts, but a radicalized, liberal demagoguery planned to further the cause of socialism based on increased government regulations to increase control over the private sector. Is this really the ulterior motive that you environmentalists and Gore-sheeple want to support????!!!! Ruefully yes, despite all the demerits to your cause.Since I care about you gullible Gore-disciples parting with your hard-earned money, I'll now outline in painstaking detail EACH OF THE NINE untruths in the Inconvenient Truth DVD.They are:1)  Gore infects Inconvenient Truth with forgeries about the unprovable urgency of levels of devastation caused by the rise in sea levels due to insignificantly melting ice caps. Gore fabricates this rise would be in the near future, yet the consensus is actually millennia away.2)  Gore falsifies that some atolls in the Pacific had already been evacuated, yet a closer look totally solidifies that this imaginary ""evacuation"" has in fact not at all occurred.3)  Gore manipulatively shows two charts relating to carbon dioxide levels and temperatures over the last 650000 years and alleges they're an exact fit. This is plotted to further fan the alarmist flames of manmade global warming. However, the British judge in the case contemptuously rebuked Gore by branding this misuse of the charts as an overstatement of his case.4)  Gore hysterically purports that the Gulf Stream--which warms up the Atlantic ocean--will shut down, and this is (pathetically and emphatically) disproved by the International Panel on Climate Change's own assessment. This group itself is partisan and favors an interpretation where global warming is believed, yet their own report tarnished Gore's Gulf Stream claim as ""very unlikely to happen.""5)  Gore disingenuously blames the mediocre drying of Lake Chad on climate change, yet Chad's drying is more reliably blamed on less sinister causes such as population increase, regional climate variability, and overgrazing.6)  Next, Gore cunningly blames the apparent loss of Mount Kilimanjaro's snows on--anyone want to take a wild guess?--climate change, but in actuality, the judge reprimanded Gore for there not being a direct link that the scientific community could find.7)  Similarly, Gore mindlessly holds climate change accountable for Hurricane Katrina (instead of blaming the chronically inept, Democratic state/local governments of Blanco and Nagin for its mishandled aftermath!!!!), yet there again, the scientific community has no consensus linking that to climate change.8)  Gore fiendishly plots to tug at the heartstrings of liberals by contriving that those poor, defenseless creatures called polar bears were actually drowning in their hopeless struggle of finding some icy habitats within all that melting from ""global warming."" However, the judge could only find four bears which died after a storm, also not caused by climate change.9)  Gore underhandedly blames coral bleaching on--c'mon everyone, take another wild guess!!!!--climate change, yet the judge ruled that separating direct impacts of climate change on coral beaching from other factors was difficult, if not impossible.There you have it, Gore-sheeple. I've confronted all of your ideological yet undeserved trust in Gore and discredited it using widely available facts. After this absolute, irrefutable debunking of your ideologue, Gore, you Gore sycophants have no further excuse for buying this DVD propaganda!!!! If you truly want to contribute to something positive, spare the money you'd give to Gore and instead donate it to some dependable, American charities that follow their money. To do anything else at this point would be mortifying and reduce you further to laughingstocks."	1.0	Even an English Judge determined that Gore's Propaganda of Global Warming was so noxious, It had to be accompanied by a Warning!	2008-04-18	33	13	20

They make you think the weather is somehow going to tilt wildly like it did in the movie The Day After Tomorrow. That is a big misconception. Case in point with the Hurricane patterns as of late, they blame global warming on them for being so strong, not true in a sense because those patterns go through cycles like what we are going through now it happened in the late 1950's- early 60's. And general climate, I was reading a review from here about a person talking about how the weather wasnt the same now when she was a child. Climate does the same thing also, remember we had The Dust Bowl and every year the leaves are not going to be spectacular color that is just the way mother nature intends it to be. It's always going to be different every year. I will say this about the movie Al Gore did a whole lot better than I thought he would.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1JZLZGQZ62RSO	"Thomas Wikman ""Texas Swede"""	"I saw ""An inconvenient truth"" about a year ago. I enjoyed the movie, but even though I take global warming seriously and have taken steps to reduce my own carbon footprint, I was not entirely impressed with the movie. First of all it contains too much junk science. Second of all it is politicized. Because of these flaws I initially gave the movie two stars. However, I realized that a rating of two stars was too harsh and I also realized that many global warming skeptics are posting here with unfair ratings, so to counter that I reposted with a better rating.As many have pointed out Katrina cannot be linked to global warming since it was not a statistical anomaly (but the European heat wave of 2003 can be linked to global warming). The polar bears did not die from global warming (some died from a naturally occurring storm), the glacier on Mount Kilimanjaro is not disappearing because of global warming and the coral bleaching and the drying up of Lake Chad cannot be blamed on global warming either, etc. That is all true. When I first saw the movie I was already aware of some of these problems with the movie and therefore the movie did not inspire me like it should have. Al Gore may have said he invented the internet, but in this movie he is inventing facts for increased effect.Also the movie has a clear political tilt to it (Democrat good, Republican bad) when the truth is that people from both parties need to get together on this issue, and both parties are to blame (Democrats coziness with big coal and Republicans coziness with big oil).The junk science and the politicization of the movie are turning off a lot of people who are, so to speak, on the fence. When you preach to the choir you will not be scrutinized but preaching to the choir is not what is needed. I believe the movie had a positive influence in the beginning, but at this point I believe it is unnecessarily turning off a lot of people. The movie could have been better if Al Gore was more of a scientist and less of a politician.Still we have to take global warming seriously. The degree of scientific consensus on global warming has never been stronger. The scientific consensus on the warming that is happening now is that it is to a large degree human induced, not natural, and it is also very rapid, and it is still only the beginning. There is a lot more CO to be released into the atmosphere. The opinions on how badly this will affect us vary among scientists, and some of these opinions are very grim, and some are less grim, but it should not be taken lightly by anyone.There is also a small chance of catastrophic climate change, meaning the changes we are causing may yet induce other natural changes in yet unknown but possible positive feedback scenarios (oceans releasing stored CO, methane releases from melting arctic bogs, undersea methane clathrates, etc.) Also don't forget the possibilities that no one have thought of yet. See the climatologist Broecker on this issue. The chances are perhaps low, but I am not willing to take the risk.Another reason to take global warming more seriously is that the rest of the countries in the industrialized world (except for a few countries) are taking it very seriously and they are getting fed up with countries that don't, especially the United States. In my home country Sweden, there is a new wave of anti-Americanism (which I very strongly oppose) and it originates in the U.S. not ratifying the Kyoto protocol and being among the worst CO polluters in the world (per capita). Global warming is very visible in Northern Sweden and some people are enjoying it, but many are also getting very scared. Many feel that the U.S. is destroying their children's future by not being a team player. This may be unfair and I don't think the U.S. should have to adjust to please Europeans. However, we all share the atmosphere; it isn't ours alone, so this case is a little different.So let's not dismiss the problem, and let's not be crazily alarmist either. Let's all consider the facts and come to an honest conclusion, and a workable action plan. Personally, I have switched my electricity away from coal to wind and water, I have insulated the house, I recycle, use energy savings lamps, I use air conditioning moderately, (and my next car will be a Toyota prius).Instead of the movie ""An inconvenient truth"" I would like to recommend ""kicking the Carbon Habit"" by William Sweet. Nature magazine also has had a lot of good research articles on the topic."	4.0	Urgent and true message but also some junk science and politics.	2007-11-03	7	4	3
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"Ok, let me get this straight. They made a documentary about Al Gore giving a lecture? About global warming? Okay, I'm already asleep. Snore. Yawn. Why don't I just stay home and save the money I would spend to take a nap.All kidding aside, if you know anything about Al Gore, you know this is a subject he is extremely committed to and passionate about. Very passionate. And after five years of some of the worst, most harmful environmental policy to ever come out of Washington, DC, there is no better time for ""An Inconvenient Truth"".I know many consider Gore to be less than a captivating speaker. But in ""An Inconvenient Truth"" he comes across as a different man because he is so passionate and committed to the subject of global warming, he comes across as a different man. Informed, knowledgeable, conversational and persuasive, if he were like this during the election, there would be no Florida Recount in our history books. Okay, so that didn't happen. But the result is that Gore, much like Clinton and Carter, are trying to do something with their status to help better the world. Gore has long been an environmental advocate and it shows. He knows the facts inside and out; people have provided him with statistics, graphs, charts and more, and he uses them in this presentation.As Gore states, he has given the lecture more than a thousand times around the globe. Because of this, he is extremely comfortable addressing large audiences, giving them a lot of scientific research to digest. Remarkably, he makes it easy to understand, pointing out key facts, walking us through some of the more difficult to understand ideas and problems. He also knows when the audience needs a break and interjects humor here and there. At one point, he shows a spoof of an educational film animated by the people at ""The Simpsons"". At others, he makes fun of himself and his political ambitions and woes.Davis Guggenheim, the filmmaker, has apparently presented Gore's lecture virtually intact. As Gore moves around on a dais, clicking for the next slide, he makes persuasive points. But he also reaches a couple of key points. When this happens, the filmmakers smartly pull back from the lecture, giving us a portrait of a few key moments in Gore's life. The argument he makes in his lecture is persuasive, intelligent and well thought out, but because we learn more about the man making the presentation, these points have even more resonance. Not only do these moments give us more details about Gore, they also provide a respite from the scientific data, allowing us to absorb what we have learned.At one point, Gore states that the data is irrefutable and it appears to be. Remarkably, the filmmakers show footage of various people attacking Gore, or claiming the data he is presenting is not based in fact. Yet, we can see it for ourselves, right in front of us. And I am sure Gore could easily provide a bibliography of resources for us to check out all of the facts he uses. What would drive some of these people to attack Gore and this data? Some of the clips are from Gore's days as a Senator and Vice President, so some of that can be contributed to political parties trying to one-up each other. But currently, Gore does not hold political office, yet the current administration seems intent on giving every break to the worst polluters in the country, allowing them to make as much money as possible while they pollute and pollute and pollute. Gore shows a slide about this argument. Apparently, there is the thought good environmental policy will impact the economy. How do these same people explain the relationship between Toyota, Honda, Ford and GM? Toyota and Honda manufacture vehicles with far better gas mileage than their competitors and are much more successful because of it. An argument Gore makes very convincingly.Thankfully, Gore stays away from political bias. More or less. A couple of times, he makes funny remarks about his failed run for the presidency, or he makes a pointed comment about the current administration, but by and large his comments are directed at us and what we should do to save our planet. The film isn't void of bias, but there could certainly have been a lot more. The fact the filmmaker and Gore showed some restraint makes his presentation even more persuasive.The film ends with a series of `calls to action' as the credits begin. Frankly, these aren't needed because Gore's arguments are so convincing. But they are effective. As one call to action states ""Urge everyone you know to see this film."" Well, folks, that's what I am doing. Go and see this film. We need to do something before it is too late to do anything. Hopefully, this film will one day be viewed as a historical document of the beginning of a great change and not as a horror film."	5.0	Go See It. Go. Right Now.	2006-05-30	1400	1075	325

I was tempted to give this movie 4 stars because of it's comedic value but didn't, thinking it didn't deserve that many stars for whatever reason. Poor al, the inventor of the internet and the world wide web, still hasn't gotten over his loss to W in Florida 2000. Make no mistake my friends, this movie is NOT about global warming or algore's concern for the earth. This is algore taking a swipe at George W Bush, the man who denied him the presidency to which he was -- err...in his mind so rightfully entitled So he comes out with an idiotic dvd attacking Bush's presidency. Thank goodness this maniacal madman did not become President.To all you people giving this movie 5 *s, understand that man made global warming is junk science propounded by anti capitalists/ socialists and Marxists with the sole purpose of attacking big businesses -- that's ALL it is. There is no substantive proof to support their claim, there never has been and there isn't any now. It's plain old fear mongering. No one is denying that there hasn't been a slight rise in the earth's temperature, but the earth's temperature has alternately risen and fallen in hundred to thousand year cycles throughout it's history. We just happen to be in a warming phase at this time. There are theories of global warming that you don't hear about in the media, such as the periodic warming and cooling of the earth coinciding with increased or decreased solar activity in the sun. This in fact is the scientifically most plausible theory. You don't hear about it in the media or in the classrooms because it doesn't support the leftist template behind global warming -- that Big Oil is evil, Big Industry is evil, Capitalism is evil, the United States is evil - plundering the Earth's resources, Bush is evil..etc And therefore the big businesses should be taxed more, with the money of course going to the same organizations and governmental depts that are trying to scare people about global warmingEven if you don't believe a word of what I said earlier(even though its true), just ask yourselves this. What is the primary source of heat on Earth, or anywhere in the solar system ? What is that prevents earth from turning into a frigid ball of ice ? What is it that causes changes in seasonal temperature? That's right -- the SUN. A slight change in its angle turns summer to winter or winter to summer, a difference of 50 to 100 deg F. When we are talking about a global warming we are talking only a few degrees ! Is it possible that the sun burning a little brighter could accomplish that ? ""The sun ? Brighter? Surely you must be joking."" No. That is because the sun is NOT a constant temperature body ! It's temperature is not constant over it's surface and certainly not over time. Don't want to get into too much detail here, but look up solar activity, sunspot activity or solar cylces in any encyclopedia. In 1975 Newsweek published an article indicating a start of global COOLING and these same prophets of doom wackos thought we would all freeze to death in the coming decades.The truth is algore probably cares as much about the environment as fish care about bicycles. He is a socialist, hates big businesses with a passion-- the same businesses that provide fuel for the cars we drive, and produce many of the products we take for granted in our everyday lives- and THAT is his primary motivation for producing this film. The real purpose of this movie is to bash Bush, the Bush administration, big corporations(especially those that contributed to his campaign funds), AND to raise taxes on those big corporations. Many of you probably dislike Bush anyway, which is ok, but don't buy into this man made global warming caca just because of that."	1.0	A deranged liberal fraudster perpetrating the biggest hoax on mankind.	2007-01-12	100	19	81

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A2N3YAM4K3ATM	-_Tim_-	"Al Gore mentions in this documentary that he has given his presentation on global warming more than a thousand times.  It is worth watching if for no other reason than to see graphic presentation software put to excellent use.  Gore has also put a lot of thought and practice into his verbal presentation, which is effective, if not as spectacular as his graphic presentation.Gore is convincing when he asserts that there is a secular global warming trend that has accelerated in recent decades, and when he asserts that human activity is (mostly) responsible for this trend.  Other aspects of his presentation are less convincing.  The paragraphs below summarize what I thought were the strongest and weakest aspects of his presentation:- He shows some persuasive graphs to illustrate evidence of climate change and show how climate change is related to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  But because the graphs are not properly labeled, inaccurate conclusions can be drawn from them, and Gore seems to almost invite his audience to draw these erroneous conclusions.  For example, he shows a time series graph, extending over tens of thousands or perhaps hundreds of thousands of years, that compares global temperatures and CO2 concentrations (these series are based on analysis of gases contained in bubbles in glacial ice).  The two series of data are obviously highly correlated, so Gore scores a legitimate point there.  He then extends one of the series to show the current level of CO2 in the atmosphere, and the trend line rises almost vertically: since the data point is more than twice as high on the graph as the highest natural levels seen over thousands of years, it appears that CO2 concentrations have increased more than 100 percent over the natural background level.  In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), established by the UN Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization, reported in 2007 that CO2 concentrations have increased 35 percent over the natural background level.  One possible explanation for the discrepancy is that Gore omitted a portion of the Y-axis, making changes appear more dramatic than they actually are.  A lot of people do this when they draw graphs, but they normally show the axes and label them so that viewers will draw correct conclusions.- While Gore effectively refutes some objections advanced by global warming skeptics, he goes too far in suggesting that any skepticism at all must be motivated by bad faith.  For example, he ridicules skeptics (he calls them ""so-called"" skeptics) who think that the current warming trend might be caused by natural phenomena that caused past warming and cooling cycles.  In fact, climate cycles caused by variations in the earth's orbit, solar activity, and volcanoes have existed throughout the historical record, and it has taken decades of scientific investigation to exclude them as alternative explanations.  The IPCC reported for the first time in 2007 that ""most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse concentrations.""  The term ""very likely"" is used by the IPCC to refer to a probability of more than 90 percent, a lower limit commonly used by scientists to conclude that a research result is reliable.  Previously, the degree of uncertainty was higher, implying a stronger basis for skepticism.  And of course the IPCC's currently asserted confidence of more than 90 percent does not eliminate all doubt either.- Gore at times draws causal links between global warming and individual local weather events that are not supported by scientific evidence.  For example, he mentions that Hurricane Katrina strengthened from a category 1 hurricane to a category 4 hurricane as it crossed warm water in the Gulf of Mexico, implying that this strengthening was a result of global warming.  In fact, Katrina strengthened over the Gulf of Mexico because it is shallower and warmer than the Atlantic Ocean.  It is speculative at best to suppose that Katrina might have been a weaker hurricane in the absence of human-caused climate change.- Somewhat related to the previous point, Gore employs a graph showing an increase in insurance losses in recent decades, implying that global warming has increased severe weather in the United States.  Perhaps it has, but surely the increased density and value of construction in vulnerable coastal areas has also contributed to these higher losses.- Near the end of the film, Gore takes on the tradeoff that exists between economic growth and environmentalism.  He essentially denies that such a tradeoff exists, maintaining that ""doing the right thing"" will create jobs and ""move us forward.""  This is disingenuous.  I would rather see Gore argue that, yes, there is a cost associated with developing and deploying cleaner technologies, but we can afford it.  (Of course the tradeoff is more severe for developing countries that are struggling to provide a decent standard of living for their people.)Having criticized many aspects of Gore's presentation in this film, I want to emphasize that I think his central points are correct: humans are responsible for significant climate change and we need to try to minimize the impacts of human activity.Gore is portrayed sympathetically in a series of vignettes that show him with his older sister (who later died of lung cancer, causing the Gore family to stop growing tobacco), with his six-year old son after a serious accident (which caused Gore to rethink his priorities), and so on.  These are very affecting, but let's keep our wits about us: Al Gore is a politician, not the selfless visionary that this documentary portrays him to be."	3.0	An Inconvenient Truth	2007-09-09	7	3	4

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AJYGQV81FSFE2	Timothy P. Scanlon	"I laugh, first, at the negative reviews. There are those among the political ""right"" who consider ""environmentalism"" a religion. So they spout off the doctrine of their peers, ignoring the century or so of warnings one of the most recent and visible of which is this film. I thank those of that dogma. You're the ones who convinced me to see this film; had it not been for your ideological baggage--conspicuous from various ""mainstream"" media and here on these pages, I may have just stayed home.True, it's full of Al Gore. In fact, that is perhaps the film's biggest weaknesses. Al quoted ""a friend of mine,"" repeatedly, most of them, e.g., Carl Sagan, named. There was sentiment: Gore's son was nearly killed in an automobile accident at I think  6 years old. So Al became ""conscientized,"" i.e., recognized the value of life, of the earth, etc. Unfortunately, there was the irrelevant. (See, right wingers? I even acknowledge some negative attributes of the film without throwing out the proverbial baby with the...well, you know.) There was a clip on Gore's having lost the 2000 election. I don't think that added a thing to the story. There was a slightly inferrable, ""I'm better than Bush on the environment and that's bad."" But that wasn't even clear. It should have been left out of the story.Gore included lots of graphs. The empirical is important if you're trying to make a point. And those points he made effectively. One that my spouse and I both noted are the 958 (nearly 1,000 in any event) scientists who acknowledge a global warming problem with NO DISSENT. Yet, 53 percent of the mainstream media were skeptical of the scientists' claim. (Remember, those overpaid media pundits get their paychecks from the media who sensationalize the skepticism and the corporations that depend on it). It makes them seem educted and informed even though they're neither!)Al even covered one Bush admin official who came from the energy industry. Despite a lack of science background, he moved into a science position in the administration. When he said something particularly inane, he resigned and went back to a larger element of the energy industry (a well-known, powerful oil company.) Hypocritical? Who could day now? Well, you're there...Gore did cover issues of POPULATION, a subject dear to me. As I noted recently, I've been challenged on the population issue by those who state that, ""We were told 40 years ago that we'd be tripping over each other and starving to death. That didn't happen."" I remind them that population scholars, Paul Ehrlich, et al, never said that would happen. Rather they stated things like Al Gore is now pointing out would happen. And the are!The graphics of what will happen as the arctic ice melts was very powerful!As I state in my title, though, I wish Gore had had some of the scientists in a panel. He is a politician, so there is an inherent question in anything he says (as there are in those clips of whom he showed, e.g., Ronald Reagan claiming that trees cause pollution!) It would have been a more powerful film had there been a panel and not an undergraduate ecology lecture which can get a little boring.However, as it isn't that long a film, I wasn't bored, and I do recommend it to everyone. Indeed, when it comes out on DVD, I may get a copy to have discussion groups at my house. Preaching to the choir? Maybe. But we need to get the word out.I wish I could've said more here, but we have our word limits. Don't miss this film, though.

It is just not a scientific movie.Does anyone realize that not only did Al Gore invent the Internet, but that he also sat for the first professor that deduced the cause of global warming?  No one ever thinks about these things.According to this 1950's style scare documentary, he also sat right next to the snot nosed kid that figured out that the continents were drifting.  The teacher didn't believe the obnoxious child's wild claims, according to Al Gore, and thus the nice teacher became an early despised non-believer.Rather than anyone wondering if there ever actually was such a child, with such a keen insight into continental drift, with a runny nose sitting next to the inventor of the Internet, many, many years ago, decades before anyone ever heard of plate tectonics - Al Gore immediately afterward tells us that because this snot nosed child was right about tectonic plates, that Al Gore's entire movie must be right.An argument born directly from the ashes of Sir Isaac Newton's scientific method, clearly - not.Al Gore is not a scientist after all!  He doesn't have to prove anything other than the fact that he really, really cares about the earth as seen from space, as clearly shown in this documentary.If he were a scientist, he might have mentioned what impact that the arrival of 100,000,000 greedy new immigrants to the United States over the last few decades, has had on our rising CO2 emissions in the United States!  Without all these new immigrants, I believe that our CO2 emissions would actually be way, way less than they were in 1950.	5.0	Invented the Internet and Stopped Global Warming Too!	2007-03-31	26	7	19

As Britain's Channel 4 reportage ""The Great Global Warming Swindle"" notes CO2 lags temperature gains and losses by, on average, 800 years. Throughout history, CO2 has never been known to ""cause"" a global warming cycle. Proponents of the theory that humans are ""first"" cause for GW reluctantly admit that the CO2 to T lag is true, but CO2 exacerbates the warming with divergent feedback ... and then ultimately, somehow reverses itself ... yes it reverses itself like any cycle does. So, with that knowledge, what was the immediate cause of all of the warming and cooling cycles throughout history (cycled increases and decreases in solar activity, maybe), especially the warming, cooling and then warming cycles throughout the 1900s? Why weren't equally warm periods when Greenland wss green, wine grapes grew in abundance in England and the economies of the era appeared to prosper not catastrophic? If the cycle always reverses itself (just as the cooling cycle in the 1970s did), what is all the panic about? I have no doubt that many, if not most, in the GW industry are sincere ... but let's have a rational debate with all sides included in the debate and not dominated by the GW religious fervor that blinds reason and smothers opposing thought as though it were heresy."	1.0	"CO2 has never ""caused"" a global warming cycle"	2007-03-18	47	11	36

A clear focus on the issue at hand would have left people to draw their own conclusions about his integrety, focus and strength of character.For the movie to include so many vignets which focus on this being Gore's Crusade is unfortunate and distracting (regardless of whether one likes the fellow or not).For the science, I give it five stars.

Yet if a frog is placed in a pot of lukewarm water and the temperature is gradually increased, the frog will keep sitting there, blissfully unaware that it is being boiled alive. Al Gore likens our own response to global climate change to that of the hapless frog; since the change we perceive is gradual, we fail to recognize the perilous situation that confronts us. ""An Inconvenient Truth"" presents us with facts we cannot ignore, showing how the world we know is already being transformed in a slew of potentially catastrophic ways: disappearing glaciers, rising sea levels, threatened species, chaotic weather patterns, disease, drought, population displacement, and more.The movie goes on to debunk the myth that climate change is controversial within the scientific community. In fact, as Gore demonstrates, there is an overwhelming consensus among scientists; the ""controversy"" we hear about has been manufactured by political and corporate interests. Further, he exposes the false dichotomy between economics and the environment, arguing that we need not--and cannot--choose between our pocketbook and the wellbeing of the planet.Gore concludes with a resounding call to action, urging Americans to stop lagging behind other nations and to instead take the lead in tackling the predicament of climate change, just as we have boldly taken on problems in the past.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A5X1B2HBQUR3P	"Vikram Ramanathan ""Live to Learn"""	(1) An Inconvenient Truth is an effort by Al Gore to educate the public about the severity of the climate crisis.(2) It weaves in events that changed his worldview, including his college education with early climate expert Roger Revelle at Harvard University, and his young son's near-fatal car accident.(3) All through the film Gore keeps referencing back to the loss to George W. Bush in the 2000 United States presidential election. Although that is not directly significant to the subject matter being discussed in this movie, it does help in providing an air of respect for Al Gore which puts us in an acceptable mood to listen to Gore's arguments. The point is being made here that afer he lost the elections he tried to focus on other things like global warming with a greater intensity.(4) He analyses the trend in the annual temperature and CO2 levels for the past 650,000 years in Antarctic ice core samples.(4)Gore discusses the possibility of the collapse of a major ice sheet in Greenland or in West Antarctica, either of which could raise global sea levels, flooding coastal areas and producing  millions of refugees.(5) Melt water from Greenland, because of its lower salinity, could halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there.(5) An Inconvenient Truth is the fourth-highest-grossing documentary film to date in the United States. Box office = $49 million.

Not all of us are environmentalists or scientists so this Dvd is a great way to inform the mass public of a very serious concern.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3O5RUMB8OWOSK	Wallace Guy	"I considered myself reasonably well educated on the topic of global warming and still found the presentation interesting and moving.The movie revolves around the content of a slide show Gore gives all over the world, over 1,000 times according to the movie.  Gore does a good job of presenting the information. He tells the story from different perspectives (water temperature, air temperature, CO2 levels, visuals from space) and is especially effective at putting the story in the context of earth's history.So many of the negative reviews are trying to either discredit Al Gore or the science he presents.  I wonder if half of them have even seen the movie, because their arguments mirror the exact frustrations expressed in the movie about how motivated organizations have effectively confused the public with misinformation.  If you don't believe the movie, that's fine, but at least watch the movie and decide for yourself.My wife and I were both quite touched by the movie.  I didn't think it was worthing adding a 251st review to the list of amazon reviews, but her response was, ""Just do it.

Just like the old days, this elixir will cure lumbago, gout, and any of a hundred aliments.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	AHTEDRC5XLKK0	"WebViking ""WebViking"""	"First of all, roughly half of this film is an homage to Al Gore the super-intelligent hero that became aware of global warming well before the rest of us idiots.  None of this garbage about what a great guy Gore is, has anything to do with the issue of global warming, and therefore, does not belong in this film.Secondly, Gore, in the worst tradition of Tennessee hucksterism presents his facts dishonestly.  Early on in the film, we see Gore's big chart of Temperature and C02 concentrations over 600,000 years as measured from core samples of Antartic ice.  Hey, when one goes up the other goes up, and when one goes down the other goes down.  They must be related, claims Gore.  Worse he implies that they are DIRECTLY related when he points to the increase of C02 concentration at the end of the last ice age, and says ""that much is the difference between our Northern cities as they are now, and our Northern cities covered with a mile of ice"".The truth is, no one knows for sure how temperature and C02 concentration in the atmosphere are related, nor over what range of C02 concentration that relationship is valid.  Gore presumes C02 is the independent variable with temperature as the directly dependent variable and increasing the C02 in the atmosphere is like cranking up the dial on a global thermostat.  It's not, and to portray it like that is flatly dishonest.The fact of the matter is that we are in uncharted territory with the concentration of C02 as high as it is now.  And no one knows exactly what will happen, or what would have happened if C02 concentrations never got as high.Gore likens the fight against C02 emissions as a moral crusade, saying that continuing the way we are now is morally wrong.  Well, there are studies that suggest if we released a billion tons or so of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere a year we could counter the warming effects of increased C02 levels.  Sulfur dioxide is cheap, we could easily do that.  Is it immoral not to do it?Somehow, I doubt that Gore would agree with that plan.  How about starting to build nuclear power plants?  That's certainly the most proven ways to generate large amounts of electricity without releasing greenhouse gases.  Would Gore and the left agree to that?It's also been calculated that 6 billion humans exhale over 4 billion tons of C02 a year.  Well, there you have it, just kill off 5 billion or so humans and you've saved the planet.  Is that moral?  There are radical environmentalists that would answer yes to that question, by the way.In short, the issues of C02 concentration and global warming are connected in ways that we don't fully understand, and are a lot more complex than what Al Gore presents in his oversimplified, intellectually dishonest, and unecessarily emotional screed.  And as such, An Inconvenient Truth is best defined as propaganda.  Like all propaganda, it should be taken with a large grain of salt.Read Michael Chrichton's A State of Fear for an example of propaganda from the other side of the debate.  At least Chrichton was honest enough to sell his book as a work of fiction."	1.0	An Unnecessary Political Screed	2007-01-16	53	18	35

It is simply jaw-dropping to even want to err on the side of ignorance. This is a very well-made film, pensive yet provocative enough to inspire action. At times, it does spend a little too much time romanticizing Gore's personal life, but it isn't overbearing and ably gets back on course. Today, we learn that a massive ice shelf has separated due to increased temperatures.

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1JX19LYKR96PW	W. Freeman	"I have been a environmental scientist and have studied climate change for most of my professional career and I have to give Al Gore credit for condensing into a feature film quite a lot of valuable environmental information that otherwise has not made it to a mass audience.  Yes, it does have some of Al Gore's life story in it as well some of the ""lecture circuit"" shots.  For the short-sighted, this may seem to be irrelevant information (the facts mam, just the facts), but it does re-enforce Al Gore's background and how he came to be an activist in Global Warming. If the film only contained the dry facts, much of the mainstream audience might not have wanted to see it.  This so-called ""irrelevant"" information is a small part of the total film and gives the film a bit of context and perspective that I enjoyed.As for the dummy that wanted to see the references ... are you expecting technical references like in a professional journal?  You don't have to believe me ... just talk to your local climatologist at a local university.  The vast majority of the information Al Gore is giving here has been the mainstay of climate study for well over a decade and some of it has been common knowledge for a lot longer than that.  Needless to say there are many potential references.  I didn't see anything that was ""made up"" by Al Gore.  Although he's ""just the messenger"", I can't think of anyone I would rather have delivering the message.Buy it, watch it, pass it on to friends."	5.0	Watched it and Loved it	2006-12-26	14	7	7

Every time Gore opens his FAT MOUTH, TONS of hot gas escape from that hole in his face.The movie is very well named.  The truth is very inconvenient...for Mr. Gore.  That's why he leaves it out.  He left out the part about buying 'carbon credits' from a company that he owns stock in, so that he can say he isn't actually leaving a king king sized 'carbon footprint' by flying around in private jets and spending over $30,000 a year on mammoth electric and gas bills for his two huge mansions.What a hypocrite!  Unfortunately there are so many of you Kool-Ade drinkers out there that even those facts won't get you to question what Gore says enough to look at any real facts.  Facts like...the SUN is getting hotter.  Which is making the earth warm...and...The earth has been through ice-ages and warming periods many times before we terrible polluting humans came along.Climate change is just the latest left-wing liberal craze.  In the 70's global cooling was going to get us.  In the 80's I remember seeing Ted Danson and other wackos telling us that in 10 years the world's oceans would be dead and that would lead to our demise.  Now it's trans-fats and global warming that are gonna get us.  No threat from terrorists though.For supposedly inventing the internet, you'd think that Al could do some better research.I rate this movie a 4 Stars because I've not laughed so hard in a long time.  And really, who doesn't enjoy a good laugh now and then?	4.0	Unexpected	2007-02-16	1	1	0

I nearly skip it, thinking it would be another of those boring documentaries, luckily, I did not.  Al Gore presents his fact in an engaging fashion, and the whole shows really hits a nerve.  I was never bored during the entire presentation. It shows the frightening future that our children will face if we do not act now, while we can.  Here's hoping that this film catches on globally, so that everyone will know what is at stake here.  Note, that as Al Gore states in his presentation, this is not rumor and fear mongering.  The danger is real, and the consequence can be as near as in our lifetime, and that there is not a single dissenting opinion in the scientific world.

I have been an environmentalist since I was very young, even though my family wasn't, and everything Mr Gore is saying about the environment is true.  Global warming is killing our planet, and George W. Bush has allowed the process to accelerate by the Healthy Forest Initiative, the Clear Skys Initiative, and any number of other Acts and Initiatives with Orwellian names attached to them.  Everyone who expects to have children, who expects to breathe, who wants to go outside must watch this movie.  It's not just flooding that's the problem, it's also the pollution.

The documentary and its narrator Vice President Al Gore are totally credible ... and over the past few days several major scientists have endorsed the movies conclusions as accurate, and the facts irrefutable. Moreover, no scientific opposition has been recorded to date.The only vocal criticism has come from vested interests who see the documentary as an attack on their monetary profits...and from the talking-heads whom they pay to spew catchy one-liners like, ""Global Warming is merely a THEORY""....NOW, WE NEED TO MOVE BEYOND THE DOCUMENTARY AND DESIGN STRATEGIES TO MAKE THIS SUBJECT THE CENTER-PIECE OF THE 2008 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. Candidates for every elective office from Dog-catcher to President should be required to link their promises to the environmental issues relevant to the offices they seek...and, there ARE issues relevant to every elective office!The concluding credits of the documentary summarize the MANY, MANY ways in which we can act...personal actions as well as  national policy. If you have not seen the movie, you will be short changing yourself if you start to walk out when the credits roll. This is a very cleverly designed summary, and has many practical follow up steps from personal action to national strategy. Please sit through and tell others to wait and read the concluding comments...My only negative comment is that while the movie-makers incorporated the summary very cleverly and artfully in the closing credits, they wrongly presumed that movie-goers will stay and watch. They missed the fact that Americans normally run out of the theater as soon as credits start to roll!"	5.0	Next Steps?	2006-07-04	27	20	7

1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A1YEPFLLH42OU1	"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia ""Yu-Jin Chia"""	What is this documentary about? Is it about global warming? Is it about Al Gore? Is it about the 2000 presidential race? Or is it just about nothing in general?I can't really answer that question, because it seems that 'An Inconvenient Truth' jumps from one of these to the other throughout Gore's exceedingly dry lecture. The bottom line is, this documentary is hypocritical, rude, misleading, and just plain boring.Gore starts off with some bad humor, then waxes on about what a nice environmentally-conscious fellow he is... while looking down upon Earth from the window of a business jet. And not just a business jet, but one with barely anyone on it. Wow, what a way to start. He also makes veiled jabs at Bush and Republicans in general throughout the presentation, and especially at the start. Apparently, Mr. Gore hasn't figured out what everyone's been thinking about him for the last 8 years: you lost. Get over it.He then goes on to show some graphs that depict a dramatic spike in temperatures. But wait- pause it there. Notice something interesting? Oh, the graph has no scale on it! If you're not a total nimrod and have at least taken grade school math, this should set off some serious warning bells.From the way Gore speaks, and an occasional clip he shows (one Simpsons animation in particular) he clearly expects his audience to be uneducated and retarded. In fact, at one point near the start he says that the sun's energy getting trapped beneath the Earth's atmosphere is called global warming. Actually, Mr. Gore, that's called the Greenhouse Effect. But wait, we're not supposed to be talking to anyone that actually knows this, so carry on.Gore also uses a great deal of anecdotal evidence to bolster his selling points, no matter that such doesn't actually prove anything. If it did, it'd be established scientific fact that aliens exist, kidnap people, perform experiments on them, and introduced the human race to Earth in the first place (in which case, sit back and relax- they'll fix global warming for us too). Just because everyone says, believes, or thinks something is true doesn't mean it's really truth. Even if a lot of scientists believe or say something is true doesn't mean it's true; and by the way, a lot of scientists disagree with what Gore has to say here. If you want to make something 'true,' you can come up with all sorts of evidence supporting it and simply ignore any evidence that contradicts it. This is well known, and it happens all the time.The really bad part of this documentary, however, is the fact that it's simply not entertaining. I wouldn't mind all the irrelevant nonsense, hypocrisy, partisan garbage, and outright deception- regardless of its effect on my sensibilities and the insult to intelligent viewers- if the film was at least FUN to watch. I've sat through and enjoyed quite a few of Michael Moore's films, even ones where I found him directly insulting, because he's at least a good showman. But sitting here listening to Al Gore do a PowerPoint presentation is not fun. It's about as boring as watching paint dry, except that usually takes less time.The bottom line is, I really am at a loss as to why this film is so critically and popularly acclaimed. It just doesn't make any sense to me... but then again, what does these days? The biggest proponents for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are the biggest emitters of such... people whine and gripe about how the US doesn't buy into the Kyoto Protocol, but they'd whine and gripe just as much (or, likely, more) if we did- once the economic side-effects smack them in the wallet. Personally, I do believe that global warming is a problem, but I don't see how scientists can possibly predict a disaster coming in the next 50 years as a result from it, when they can't even predict the weather in the next 50 hours. And I'm not convinced there's any way we can 'fix' it without resorting to painfully expensive strategies, which nobody is willing to do. 'An Inconvenient Truth' really doesn't do anything to make me feel that global warming is any more urgent a problem than I thought before seeing it, nor does it propose any likely solution. It looks like a bunch of propaganda and scare tactics, that play more on emotion than any real fact.Do yourself a favor, and find some real entertainment instead.	1.0	Boring, partisan, and generally dumb	2007-12-10	47	18	29

If that's their theory, just look at the temperatures of the current winter season in North America. 2006 has also been recorded to be the hottest year ever, thus setting the stage for even more global warming in the future. There are people who argue that our unseasonably warm winter is due to normal fluctuations or the phenomenon known as El Nino. Sure, the temperatures do fluctuate, but the there has always been an upward trend.I like this documentary because in it, Al Gore presents the facts without politicizing the environmental issue. Countless scientific studies and articles have warned the public about the potential harms of global warming but none have had the widespread impact or audience that this movie does. It is pretty cool to know that there are influential people who actually care about the environment enough to actually go out there and use their influence (or celebrity or power, whichever you like) to educate the public about it. I like that the director intersperses Al Gore's slide show presentation with behind-the-scenes snippets of Al Gore's life too.However, what I don't like about this documentary is the lack of information on how the individual can help save the environment. Towards the end of the movie, there are simple suggestions on how to save energy and recycle that are shown in really, really small types. I mean, really, who stays around after the movie to look at the credits? It would've been better to incorporate them into the documentary.I recently read a commentary about Al Gore and this documentary. The article basically bashed Al Gore as being duplicitous and hypocritical because while he's going around the world preaching about the imminent environmental meltdown, he's not doing anything to help either. The writer mentioned that Al Gore has two oversized mansions powered with nonrenewable energy that he doesn't need (considering that his kids are grown up and not living with him). He also cited his ""anti-environmentalist"" voting record when he was the VP.Although I'm disappointed by the actions (or lack thereof) of the messenger, it is still worthwhile to listen to the message of pro-environmentalism. Unlike other influential people who either do nothing or ""actively ignore"" corporations polluting the environment, at least Al Gore is trying to spread the news to people who might not know there is a real problem. Overall, I recommend this documentary for those who are curious or who want clarification on the global warming issue.

This is a documentary about a slide show on Global Warming that Al Gore has given all over the world. The movie itself consists of different sections of the slide show with Gore presenting to an audience, intercut with different shots narrated by Gore.The information displayed here is very clear. Gore doesn't try to rush through anything or generalize as he's presenting. This movie is simply a wake up call to everyone in America, and even the world, letting us know what we've been doing to the planet over the last 50 years, and what we're continuing to do. Some of the information is shocking.The most shocking to me was when Gore showed two statistics. One was the number of stories in science magazines that disagree with the idea of global warming. Out of around 1000: ZERO disagreed. Then, out of around 600 mainstream media stories on the same topic: 53% expressed doubt that global warming was real. That should give anyone watching a wake up call to what our media is really used for.Everything Gore presents in this movie is precise and thought out. If there's any counter-argument to any of this information I would love to hear it.And at the end Gore actually offers solutions for us. He doesn't just complain and point out what we're doing wrong. He shows how we have the technology to fix this, and explains that we have to do it one person, one family, one town at a time. I didn't know much about Al Gore before this movie, but I respect him a great deal now for what he's doing with this movie.	4.0	4 stars for the movie, 5 for the concept	2006-12-20	21	12	9
1415724784	An Inconvenient Truth	A3AHMJQWK00LTQ	"Zino Davidoff ""zino"""	"Well, I've read enough to know that the science presented in ""Inconvenient Truth"" is correct. The telling statistic in the movie: no climate scientists dispute the evidence that the cause of global warming is man-made, but over 50% of media reports express doubts. So corporate media--filled with ads from oil companies--isn't clarifying the debate, but instead plants seeds of doubt in the public mind.Reading the one-star reviews on this web page reveals consistent parroting of right-wing talking points that politicize truth into science fiction. The ignorance is stunning.As to the complaint that there's too much Al Gore in this film, I'll just allow myself to disagree. The guy's been tarred relentlessly by his political adversaries. He never claimed he invented the Internet, you pinheads! That was a misquote published in a newspaper that never got adequately retracted. It's again a punchline used to avoid the real issue of the science presented in the documentary.Gore's a really decent man, and the inclusion of his personal journey and why he came to care so deeply about this issue is absolutely relevant. It actually depoliticizes his 'motives' for presenting his slide show.People also forget that the reasons there wasn't more done during the Clinton/Gore administration is that the so-called conservative right had just taken charge of Congress and wouldn't dream of enacting any legislation like this. Clinton/Gore never presented Kyoto for a vote because it would never have been approved by the Republicans.But all the blather misses the point. There will always be people who continue to claim that cigarettes don't cause cancer, that seat belts don't save lives, and that people don't affect the climate.The Catholic Church only pardoned Galileo in 1992, okay?
