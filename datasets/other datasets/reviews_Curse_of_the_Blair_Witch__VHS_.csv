6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	ASG3P4XF28AFR	1LT Robert Garner	I think that this movie made it's fame through hype.  I'll admit, I was excited when we finally got the video and we first turned it on on  Halloween night.  However, it was possibly one of the most boring movies  that I've seen... recently at least.  I was extremely disappointed.  It was  cheaply made, which is what brought it all of the attention I guess, but  there are plenty of other scary movies with good special effects and where  the camera doesn't bounce around the whole movie filming feet and piles of  rocks.  Don't waste your time.	1.0	If the footage was real, it might have been a little scary.	1999-11-01	0	0	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1NOLEWY3EBW01	683	"If there's anyone who's a big fan of horror, I'm sure they know ""The Blair Witch Project"". For someone who is a fan of the horror genre (me), this movie is a guilty pleasure. Now the ""found-footage"" genre is getting worn out (although I love it), but ""Blair Witch"" is original and is one of the most innovative movies of all time. The first time I saw it, I wasn't really scared, but when it was nighttime I was kinda creeped out. To truly be creeped out or scared by this movie, you have to place yourself in the character's shoes, you can't just sit back and watch the movie expecting to be scared. You have to kind of work your head around it all. You might watch the first 2 nights and think ""That's not scary"", but just pretend you're actually out there hearing footsteps in the woods at nighttime from 15-20 feet away. It's pretty creepy. There's a lot of the film that contains them fighting a lot, and yelling at each other, but it's also sad to watch all that happens to them. If you're bored during the first couple nights, Night 5 is when it's really thrilling, because outside of their tent they hear children laughing and a baby crying. A short moment afterwars, there's a violent pounding on the tent so they run out of it screaming. That's one of my favorite parts. Another one is, obviously, the apology scene (You see it on the cover on the bottom when it shows half her face). I think that's an emotional and disturbing scene from the movie. It's another one of my favorites, and it should have won an Oscar, but instead it won a Razzie. My third favorite part from the film was the ending. It's very freaky and you'll be thinking about it hours after you see it, but there's foreshadowing in the beginning that happens in the ending, so to get the end, you have to see the beginning. Another good scene is when they see all the stick figures. This film is brilliantly executed and it's one of my favorite horror movies of all time."	5.0	Very creepy and classic movie!	2011-01-08	3	2	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3ILB9AXW88EZT	Aaron Dwight King	This film is not a piece of cinema, but an amateur horror film.  Some people find this its most compelling aspect, it makes it believable to them, but it is in the end the film's achilles heel.  Had &quot;dan and  ed&quot; been schooled in the classics, they might have come up with a  dense and interesting film, using the SAME TECHNIQUES.  They simply lack  the visual and narrative grammar to carry it off.  Instead, the film comes  off as sloppy and weak-storied.  There's a ton of backstory, but the film  itself lacks depth, intencity and direction.  This film is a wasted  opportunity to show the world the power of mockumentary filmmaking.  Try  Cannibal Holocaust (1980, Italian) on for size.  This is a horror movie to  scare only first-time filmgoers.	1.0	Should have stayed an independent	1999-12-14	5	2	3
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1YSDK1ZEVMT7U	Aaron M.	"This is a film comes with some baggage: the whole ""true story"" marketing campaign and the insinuation that the events unfolding were not just a film recreation, but actual found footage. The same thing that helped make it a smash hit was probably to blame for the backlash against it. People probably felt duped and there is little else that makes people angrier than feeling like a fool. Other films have used this technique; The Coen Bros Fargo or Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, neither of which were later hated for the use of it, though neither of those films tried to present their movie as actual footage either.I didn't get to have the experience of thinking it was real; I had heard about it months before the release from other horror fans on the internet who were already blasting as a rip off of The Last Broadcast and Cannibal Holocaust before they had even seen it. I didn't have high hopes for it.I did see it several times in the theater though, with several different groups of people. Initially I was reluctant but by the time I saw it near the end of its run, at a matinee where only myself and one friend were the total audience, I was a very willing viewer.Some people complained about the shaky camera. It never bothered me. Most people I went with were True Believers. They just knew it was a true story and the footage was real, no matter how much I tried to convince them otherwise. I'm not sure if they were truly fooled or fooled themselves because they wanted it to be true. I'm not sure which is more disturbing: the film, or the people that wanted to believe these three people in the film were actually dead. Personally I would have been much less interested in seeing a snuff film. I wouldn't have gone to see that.I can't understand anyone who was angry at the fact that what they had thought was three dead people cringing in terror during the final days of their lives, turned out to be fiction. Seriously, you don't think these kids families would have had something to say about their children deaths being turned in a money-making entertainment? Come on.But enough of all that, what about the film? For me it's a great nod to films like The Haunting (1963) and the school of horror where the implied is king and your imagination does the job on you. I'm not going to argue with those who hate implied horror or think its cheap. I'm also not going to accuse them of having no imagination. Everyone has their own taste. Whatever.But I would even include such films as the Exorcist and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre within the sphere of implied horror. For every shock the Exorcist throws at you, it offers another subtle implied threat. One you have to think about to fully experience. With Chainsaw it's the fact that very little blood or gore is shown, the film lets your imagination do most of the heavy lifting.Unlike those two films though, Blair Witch does not even share time with more direct horror. It wants to be a mind fueled shadow play through and through, and I applaud it for having the courage to do so...and for me, it works.Its three main characters are distinct, fleshed out, and most importantly sympathetic. The best horror asks you to empathize with its characters. The characters here are not cardboard cut-outs that the filmmakers can brutalize for the pleasure of the crowd. Some people didn't like Heather, but I saw her more ""objectionable"" behavior as a coping mechanism, hiding behind her camera and insulting the other characters at times as an understandable attempt to keep the fear underneath at bay.A lot of their acting is subtle and not shoved into your face. In a normal movie this would not be the case. Character moments would be underscored with music and typical film language which would lead the viewer into what to think. Blair Witch is not interested in leading you by the nose in such a way. They respect their audience enough to allow them to think for themselves.These characters do bicker a lot, especially as the stress of their situation begins to take its toll. Their situation strips away the faade of civilization. It's not heroic or romantic. It's what happens to real people. Not that it's all pessimism. Once acceptance has come, it allows for truth to come out in a way it rarely does (Heather's confession), and towards the end Mike shows courage as he single-mindedly seeks to find their missing comrade. The best horror lifts the faade of the false goodness of the ""civilized"" person (with its conditional nature of doing for others only as a means to gain for oneself) and shows humanity's base selfish, frightened animal side. But perhaps buried under that can be found true goodness, or at least some authenticity.The filmmakers present a rich back story in a short period of time. They pull this trick off by sprinkling bits of information throughout the film from various sources of uncertain dependability. They leave you to fill in the blanks, simulating how such legends grow and spread in the real world. They offer many possible sources for the events in the film, never truly settling on any definitive answer. Observant viewers will notice the tales relevance to the story as it unfolds. (the seven missing children from the Justin Parr story coinciding with the characters finding seven piles of rock cairns in the cemetery later on, for instance)Despite the supernatural overtones in the film, there are no definitive supernatural events. Nothing that could not be explained away rationally. Even their returning back the their point of origin after walking for an entire day could be explained away by a faulty compass and the very real phenomenon of human beings tendency to walk in circles when lost.Unlike most films, we can't explain anything away through hallucinations. The nature of the film being that everything is being picked up on camera, we are not allowed the luxury of that. So, something is definitely out there. Something that sounds like small children playing at times. A bit hard to explain that one away, unless there really is a cult living out there in the woods. Could be. Could be ghosts. Could be human agents. Could be the Blair Witch. It largely lets you fill in your own answer, which serves those of the more supernatural bent and those that favor a more rationale answer. Some people don't like question marks in their films, so I guess it loses out with that crowd but otherwise it's great the way the filmmakers have managed to allow the film to have its cake and eat it too."	5.0	A welcome throwback to the era of intelligent realism in horror.	2011-11-11	4	4	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A6469EYRFOWAE	Abdulla Al Ruwaihi	I will give you an advice before watching this movie, DON'T watch it alone and be awaire that after watching it some seens of it will remaine in your memory for a long time. Three people going to the Maryland woods to  discover something which nobody was stupid enough to do it before them and  after they made interviews with the city people witch was like an advice to  them to not go there.If they made a good plane and trained well about  what they might going to experiance there and knowing their way in there  very well, they would not face any problem if the wanted to escape from  there, because of that they lost their life and they realy fail to prove  anything to all of us. This movie is for ages 22 and above.I will give  this movie 3 Stars in the middle becouse advantages and diadvantages for  this movie are equal.	3.0	Is it a REAL story as I heard !	2000-02-23	0	0	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A26XB6DPCV4ROO	Abel Gil	This is one horrendous piece of dog feces. This is truly one the most overrated film in the history of cinema. They called the fact that the director's used a minimal script, horrible equipment, and good actors wasted on improvisational lines that my little brother could write, creative. Boy were they wrong. The only enjoyable aspect of it all is the ending, which is bone chilling, other than that expect two hours of pointless drivel. Is this a study on how people and isolation, as well as fear, can not interact? By no means, there are better films that explore psychology than this gargantuan heap of flies. Is this a horror film? It is not a horror film, neither standard or cliched or of any sort, not even a gore flick, which could at least make us enjoy some aspect of it. It has no intelligence, contrary to the critics belief, its just some kids lost in the woods find out that a legend is true...haven't i heard this before? The filmmakers force you through more than an hour of three people goin' around in circles lost in the woods and encountering things that would only scare the most gullible of folks. It is until the last five, count them, five minutes that you can enjoy this flick or feel horrified to the least denominator.Other than that await seemingly endless film sludge. In fact i found it so dull that i actually thought the peripheral material like the fake documentaries found within the dvd,or on video, about the blair witch to be more terrifying than this massive mistake. The film itself though is pig slop. This is not innovative or genius it is just silly and boring. Trust me i've sst through some boring stuff in my entire life and i have seen films that move, innovate, inspire, terrify, and much more, but this is just the drivel of a 6 year old with a camera and a few friends, and not even good drivel. Ed Wood did a better job with Plan 9 From Outer Space. At least we expected manure from him.However three stars are deserved for the ending, which proved to be the most terrifying (in a good way) thing in the film.  It showed a lot of potential.  One or two scenes in between the beginning and the end also show plenty of potential and are actually watchable.  However the scenes in the woods fail to communicate any suspense or worry for these &quot;lost&quot; travelers. Instead they just make you sit through meaningless drek.  They fail to make these characters believable, like i'm sure they were supposed to do. In other words, while this film was supposed to look realistic it looks staged, very staged.The dvd features also contribute to the final three star judgement. As previously mentioned the documentaries piqued my interest and perked up my interest in the film. But alas the film was poorly executed on most behalfs.	3.0	Not a spring daisy...	2000-06-06	0	0	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3TQNHCBMI4FLY	Access97	I can't say I like this movie because I don't and I regrett for not reading the reviews first. The movie is a home video made by a trio of persons who claim to be actors. This trio goes to the woods where the witch  used to have her cementery of children. By some mysterious reason, they get  lost in the woods, even by following the map they found themselves walking  in circles. One of the characters, decides to throw away this map because  it finds it worthless. This event triggers the movie when they accept that  they are already lost. Later on, they find witchcraft art work in the  woods. As the &quot;set of video clips&quot; pass by they start to get  scared of strange noises, and other weird things that happen to them first  at nights and ,towards the end of the movie, during the day too. The creepy  and the terror actually happens in the imagination. I felt at times anxious  during the movie. But that's how they decided to design the movie. At times  with suspense, at others with laughs, and others with sadness. This movie  is a must see for people who like Terror movies. But the rest of the public  should try to avoid it. The movie has a bad production, amateur actors, and  poor scripts	1.0	The movie is not worth the promotion that it has had	1999-11-22	10	7	3

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1LBAC84TLIGAX	"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF"""	"When The Blair Witch Project was released in 1999, it was met with raving critical reviews, but was trashed by moviegoers aplenty who complained of boredom and stupidity. Despite the mixed response, its impact on horror films cannot be denied and it spawned a wave of cam corder films (Best imitators: Open Water and REC) and showed us the power of independent film-makers and how they can outdo Hollywood vets when they put their heart into a film. Is this film overhyped? In some ways, yes it is. But I certainly don't think this is a bad film. This is a horror film that taps into a primal fear and gets into your skin. It also leaves you with many questions (Which can be frustrating), but it also leaves a great deal of intrigue and it is a rather fascinating film.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: October 1994. Three friends: Heather, Mike, and Josh are all setting out to make a documentary about a legend about the Blair Witch by interviewing people in a town and then eventually trekking into the woods to see if they can get anything on camera. However, after a period of time the trio gets lost and a night they hear strange noises and as each night goes by it gets worse. The group begins to run short on supplies, they're hungry, tired, and begin blaming each other for getting lost. Things begin escalating and the group gets more and more lost and learn all too quickly about what may be in store for them.MUSIC: There is none. That is the one thing I don't like about cam corder films, most of them don't have music.ACTING: These are easily among the most believable performances in horror history. These actors really do make you believe they are afraid and you can feel their tensions as things begin to degrade and go horribly wrong. Stunning and superb is how these performances should be characterized. Don't let young children watch this because the dialogue is loaded with F-bombs, but I have no gripes with the dialogue either.ACTION: If you hate slow films, then I suggest you don't watch this film. It intends to build suspense and makes you wait for what happens. While this film didn't particularly scare me, it was pretty creepy and atmospheric and it does this very well. This film isn't really violent either, it's mostly just about tapping into your fears through unanswered questions and ""what the hell was that?"" kind of moments. If you have patience and love horror flicks, then this is a must-have. No patience and you'll hate it with a fiery passion.OVERALL: If you like horror films that really leave you guessing and tapping into your inner fears, then you should buy this film. If you want an ultra-gory horror film with lots of action, then you should stay away from it. This is a very weird and creepy little horror flick that can still outdo horror films to this day. Even if you hate it, you cannot deny its impact on the horror genre.THE GOOD: A really creepy and dread-inducing atmosphere, superb acting, and it feels eerily realistic.THE BAD: No music and it leaves a bit too many unanswered questions."	4.0	NOT PERFECT, BUT A VERY WEIRD AND EERIE FILM  8 OUT OF 10	2010-04-01	1	1	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1ZLC8YCKVEIK2	A Customer	INTRODUCTION. Man, what a scary movie! When I was younger I watched all the blood-and-guts, shock tactic stuff and by now I thought I was immune. But this one had me on the edge of my seat, fingers occasionally covering  my eyes, and kept me awake all night. This review will point out several  new and original aspects of the filmmakers' techniques, as well as some old  and not-so-original ones, which are used throughout the film to enhance the  effect of suspense and fear.CINEMATOGRAPHY. The film's most outstanding  aspect is clearly the use of ostensibly documentary footage. The attempt to  portray fictuous events through Hi-8 and 16mm is, of course, intended to  give the movie a &quot;real&quot; feeling, but it also serves the purpose  of allowing us to view the events through the characters' eyes. Thus, the  escape scene on the third night - and of course the closing scene - carry  an eerie feeling of participation, added to by the unstable movements of  the camera and the natural lighting conditions. It is a kind of no escape  situation, where it is much more difficult to tell yourself that &quot;it's  just a movie&quot;. Also, the use of long periods of darkness with sound  only adds to the keenness of the senses. For example, the sound of the  tent's zipper - used at least twice - is very potent in this dark  situation, as an indication that something is about to happen. Another  point is the alternation between Hi-8 and 16mm. This serves as a seperator  between the outer framework of the film's storyline - the outing into the  woods - and the inner, more substantial layer - the scenes directly  concerning the occult events. In this context, it is worth noticing that  after Josh's disappearance, the 16mm is in the hands of Heather - meaning  that we enter even deeper into her own point of view. It is during this  stage of the film that she also comes into the most direct focus of  attention, peaking in her self-filmed apology (this is shot on the Hi-8  again, creating a methodical diversion from her 16mm point of view and  bringing us even closer to her). Despite these interesting effects, the  alternation between the two cameras also has a drawback - it reminds us  that the film was edited and is not &quot;real&quot; after  all.FAMILIARISATION. Throughout the film, various techniques are used to  enhance the viewers' identification with the characters, and thus  strengthen the fear and agony when something happens to them. The directors  clearly had in mind that the audience would be mostly made up of teenagers  and young adults. It was therefore their goal to make them feel that the  portrayed events were happening to people like them. Thus, Heather, Josh  and Mike are depicted as typical American youngsters in the 90's. The first  element serving this is their lingo - words like &quot;totally&quot; as a  multi-purpose augmentative adjective; &quot;like&quot; at the beginning of  every other sentence; and the uninhibited use of four letter words. This  was an easy task, since it only required the actors to use their natural  mode of speech. Also, there are the various means used by the characters to  placate themselves in face of fear, such as the semi-hysterical fights  among the characters in order to &quot;clear the air&quot; amongst  themselves. A final important aspect is the use of sex. Josh says he wants  &quot;his mother's mashed potatoes and a lay&quot;; Heather writes in her  journal that &quot;some nookie would be nice at this point&quot;. The  Erotic is depicted as an opposite to what the characters are experiencing,  all young viewers will identify with this craving, and its frustration will  make the film all the more disturbing.MAIN THEME. Nobody's perfect, and  you can't be 100% original 100% of the time. It seems clear that the  filmmakers drew upon their own acquaintance with horror movies in creating  their main themes, and some ideas ring a very familiar bell. I'm referring  to &quot;The Return of the Child Murderer&quot; theme: stories of past  atrocities haunt the community, only to spawn a new set of events in the  present. This theme was thoroughly explored in &quot;A Nightmare on Elm  Street&quot;, and plays the central part in this film as well. Just as  Freddie Krueger was a child murderer killed by the Elm street parents, thus  the Blair Witch was supposedly responsible for the disappearance of  children after she was banished in the 18th century. Rustin Parr, the  1940's child murderer who said that he was inspired by the witch, brought  his victims to his cellar just as Freddie Krueger did. But even if it's  been done before, the use of the child murder theme never fails to invoke  our deepest fears. It is not only a radicalization of children's spooky  tales such as the Boogey Man, but also the strongest possible thematic  confrontation of good and evil, innocence and vileness. But although the  film ultimately boils down to the same old ways of manipulating our primal  fears, it is done in a highly original way that succeeds in finding a new  route to these fears and reawakening them. The image of Mike facing the  corner in the movie's shocking peak achieves its terrifying effect through  the total annihilation of his personality and his turning into another  faceless victim.CONCLUSION. What is the next step for horror films after  The Blair Witch Project? This film has certainly stretched the boundaries  and succeeded in plucking our nerves in the most unmediated way - without  music and without special effects. Perhaps the answer is to be found in the  exploration of horror themes other than that of child murder, through the  same &quot;documentary&quot; techniques used here. An attempt to thus  &quot;documentalise&quot; Ghost Haunting, Nuclear Holocaust or Serial  Killings has the potential of not only giving us another great scare, but  also of creating a whole new class of film - the &quot;documentary&quot;  horror movie - in which The Blair Witch Project will always be remembered  as the seminal piece.	5.0	The Old Tricks Still Work	2000-06-05	10	4	6
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3UXT4LEA1E9WZ	A Customer	First off, anyone who gets seasick will need to take motion sickness medication before watching this movie.  Those of you who are afraid of the dark, are afraid to use the bathroom at night, and  don't watch horror  movies... ever (like my sister), will find this film scary.  For those of  you who have seen &quot;horror, suspense and thriller&quot; movies, this  one lays an absolute egg.  I rate good horror movies by how long it takes  me to fall asleep at night after watching it alone.  This one put me asleep  while I had it still running in my DVD player.  I have easily seen over a  100 &quot;horror&quot; films in my time.  This is worse than some of those  B-films of the 1980's.  You know, the ones that were more funny than scary.  This movie is perfect for insomniacs, though.  I can't believe the movie  cost $40,000 to make.  They must have spent it on food during the making of  the film.  See the &quot;Exorcist&quot; for a truely horrific experience,  see &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; if you find your family's home  movies scary.  If the sequel will be anything like the original, they  should call it &quot;Blair Witch 2 - Killer Migraine.&quot;	1.0	Hey, it's my dad's home movies.. I'm getting a headache now!	2000-05-01	6	4	2

A year later only their film was found, the student film makers disappeared. This film shows what happened when they investigated the legend of the ""Blair Witch"". Various people tell their stories about past murders. Care is taken to make this film seem amateurish and unedited. The descriptions of deaths set the tone of fear. The three students appear to be lost. And very clueless. The rain falls, the students babble about their fears. Then they walk around to find their car. But Heather doesn't seem to know the way back. In the dark they hear strange noises. What can it be? How did the piles of rocks appear by their tent? What happened to the map? Personal conflicts appear under stress. [The raw language does not improve the story.]They arrive at a place where sticks are tied together and hang from the trees. Strange noises are heard in the dark. Are they animals or human? ""It's not quite reality."" The students chatter about their feelings; this pads out the film. Heather and Michael are scared in the dark night. Their trek continues. They are hungry and cold, and scared. A deserted and decaying house provides the ending. Were you scared by this pretentious project?

That girl was one whiny broad; I would like to give her a rap in the mouth.  PLOT: Three student filmmakers go looking for a witch who  kills kids (okay, what's the point?  Did they actually believe in the  witch?  If so, then why the hell?  If not, then why the hell?).  After a  little while, they start yelling f--- you at each other for 30 minutes.  They run out of food, yet their camera keeps running, because it's  obviously powered by a nuclear generator.  The camera is aimed at the  ground for most of the film.  This is because the Blair Witch is actually a  squirrel. After yelling f--- at each other for awhile, the three get tired  and decide to walk some more.  Oh, yeah, if they would've actually shut up  and walked for 10 minutes, they would have found a Total station just down  the road.  So our heroes trek on, casually using profanity for no apparent  reason.  One guy dies.  He yells for awhile, and the other two simply yell  back, &quot;Sean?  Where the f--- hell are you, you little  motherf---er?&quot;  Or something like that.  Then it gets dark again (it  does that a lot; usually there's a bird fluttering against the tent which  makes our heroes mess themselves).

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A32N7HHCJMT0YA	Adam Fisher	To be scared out of my mind, all I had to do was put myself in the three teens' shoes-being totally LOST, hearing those creepy human voices every night nearby, having hiked for hours and hours a day only to get trapped and lost deeper and deeper into the woods which is inhabited by some serious crazies. And trust me, you will feel like you are right there, getting deeper and deeper, hopelessly lost in the woods with them. There is one scene while they are camping at night that WILL definately freak you out. You'll be watching the last scene through  your fingers that are covering your horrified, freaked out face. And I don't think the theatre is the right atmosphere to watch this movie. This freaked-out movie MUST be watched ONLY late at night, between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. alone in the dark. I think this is the creepiest thing since Amityville Horror. The first 20 minutes or so, it kinda takes a while to get going, but once the teenagers are actually in the woods, DON'T LEAVE-WATCH!!! It starts slowly and then builds and builds and builds!! That last scene is so horrifying and chilling that you will keep looking away from the TV screen to double check that you're home and NOT actually lost in the cult infested woods with them in the middle of the night!!!!!	5.0	Creepy and very scary!!	2003-03-15	4	1	3
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2Y075MUNQELT4	Adam Macielinski	I have a large collection of DVDs.  I only ever sold one DVD - this one, because I hated it.  I found the premise about as boring as you could get.  The characters were annoying and grated on my nerves (particularly the girl).  The camerawork made me sick - just kept jumping around all the time.  This certainly is a horror film - a horror that such a thing can be made, and even made to sell.  Don't waste your money.  Rent, maybe, if only to satisfy your curiosity, but if you do rent, get another film as well because you'll probably want to switch this one off after about 15 minutes.  Please don't take my word for it, just look at all the second-hand copies being sold - you don't see anything like that for films of any quality.

It is, along with Sixth Sense and The Ring, the only horror movie that scared the sh*t outta me. No special effects? no 'monstrous appearances'? who needs that!? this movie is the proof that visual effects are not everything, that there should be more in a movie, especially in this devaluated genre. I mean, come on, most horror movies suck, and they end up being stupid, in some cases even annoyingly stupid. From what I hear, the marketing techniques used for the release of Blair Witch Project worked perfectly. Is that a reason to bash the movie itself? I don't think so... I don't really care how much money they made, or if they suggested it was the actual footage found or whatever, because even though I'd heard of it, even when it was released, I'd never watched before. I remember my sister saw it the day it was released and she thought it was a dumb movie, she told me how she'd wasted an hour and a half on such movie, etc. Well, I just finished watching it, and my imagination is still working with it! the scenes shot at night are disturbing as hell, and the end is as scary as it is confusing. I loved it, it is definitely worth a try.	5.0	What could be scarier than your own imagination?	2006-01-13	4	3	1

I had to run out of the theatre, well ok maybe it didn't scare me that much, must have been that shaky camera that made me sick but as I walked back in to see the climax,  I actually enjoyed this fake, strange little film. I wasn't aware the premise of the film wasn't real until weeks later but it did the trick for me. First of all, the ending had me shaking in my boots.

The idea seems to be OK, but I don't believe that anyone who likes horror movies rated BWP as superb.  The main problem of that movie is that you don't have  reasons to be frightened. Woods are not too deep, trees are not too high  and &quot;voodoo stuff&quot; is not too scary either. Students hear some  strange sounds at night but I didn't hear anything really weird. In fact,  it's really more frightening to walk around my countryside house at  night!So, if you like horror movies, avoid this one	1.0	Titanic is more scary than this one!	2000-05-13	6	4	2
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3KMMXLJFQENDZ	Alex A. Fintonis	This film is hilarious.  That might be a bit strong of a statement, but I really looked at this movie like a dark comedy.  As the film begins the creepiness starts to build, but once the three teens start to flip out and begin to scream at each other that's when comedy begins.  For one thing one character actually admits to throwing the only map they have in the river.  Why in the heck would someone do that?  I know when I'm somewhere I not too familiar with the last thing I do is throw away my map.Granted I can understand how the characters would loose it while being lost in the woods. Plus having unusual wicker/stick sculptures left in their camp would be a bit freaky.  However, it seemed to me like a cult of the so-called Blair Witch and not the spirit of the witch herself were terrorizing the teens.  I'm not sure if that was the director's attempt or not but it seemed like it to me.  Despite the fact that the film was shot on such a low budget the cinematography was decent.  The woods always make a good setting for horror films, because lets be honest anyone who is in the woods especially at night can get a little disoriented and nervous.This film however didn't frighten me much at all. I think mainly because the first time I saw it I already knew that the film was not real footage but with actors.  I could see that there was a definite creepiness factor in the film, but I was more entertained by the characters themselves and their dialogue.  The film had more of a dark comedy/thriller feel to it than horror.  It still had its entertaining moments and for the most part it was pretty creative, just not too original.	3.0	Does anyone have the map?	2006-07-09	5	2	3

Because  basically that what the film is about making you believe that something  terrible is about to happen and playing on YOUR fears and it is best  watched without be truly aware that no real scary scenes are aired and that  it all suspense. Once you remove that then the film struggles and then you  notice little things like that the characters are so annoying that you  don't really care if they live or die (Actually in my opinion The  Blair-Witch actually does us a favour). The impressive part of this DVD is  the extras with a whole documentary of the Blair Witch and a featurette  which makes this a DVD to buy (and hence the 4 stars)	4.0	Excellent Dvd, Average Film	2000-05-19	0	0	0

It had my interest initially, but it doesn't take long to realize it's less about whatever it is that's after these people, then it is about watching three completely stupid characters squabble. Perhaps because jiggling camera shots is reminiscent of snickering at someone's dad's old home movies, I felt that the panicked effect would have been as effectively maintained and the irritation factor lessened if the jiggling had been toned down. The gimmick of filming without a script is vaguely innovative, the acting isn't that terrible, it is atmospheric, and it's genuinely scary at times. It's unusual enough to be interesting, although I don't like having to justify dissatisfaction in a movie with the rationale that they were trying something different.

I had read an article about it in Entertainment Weekly, and I said to myself, ""I HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE."" Why? Because it sounded original; like nothing else that had ever been done before. I knew, of course, that the ""footage"" wasn't real, but I hear some people actually believed the whole thing was a true story. For those people, I'm sure 'Blair Witch' freaked them out. As for me, well it freaked me out too. At the time.Now, I hang my head in what I guess should be considered shame. 'Blair Witch' was graced with the same exact curse as 'Titanic': a movie that became so big, so popular, that it suddenly, for inexplicable reasons becomes uncool to like. I don't know why this is really. But now, it is embarassing to admit it. But I will anyway. I was a 'Blair Witch' freak. After seeing the film, I ran out and bought the book, and taped the fake documentary off the Sci-Fi Channel. I wanted to see it again and again. I absolutely loved it.I still really like it. I mean, even if you absolutely hate it, and say it wasn't at all scary, you have to admit one thing: this is one of the most original films ever. The whole movie is shot with two different hand-held cameras, by the actors themselves. Most of the dialogue you hear spoken by the 3 characters was actually ad-libbed (in fact, I think I read that there was actually no script for the movie, and that it was all up to the actors). Heather, Josh and Mike (which are the actors' real names and the characters' names) all did a great job, considering the conditions they were under (camping out in the cold, damp woods, filming themselves making up a script as they went along). And the Blair Witch herself? Well we never actually see her. That's the creepiest part about it. Is there really a Blair Witch haunting the woods, looking for some more people to kill? Or are all of the noises they hear at night just in the characters' imaginations? Hmm. We may never find out, really.'Blair Witch' spawned many, many parodies (amongst my favorites, the 'Wizard of Oz' one) which were well-deserved. Maybe it is actually a parody itself. Who knows. A lot of people thought it was boring, and maybe now I can see where they were coming from. But you have to give credit where credit is due. Thanks to filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, I will think twice before entering the woods. And I will definitely think twice about filming it."	4.0	Well, It Was Really Great at the Time...	2003-03-28	5	0	5

However, I went to the theater to be scared.  I mean, Rolling Stone had said, ""Scary As Hell!!""  And, it wasn't alone.  Bunches of reviews indicated this was something special.It wasn't.  This movie totally depended on people's fear of the woods and the dark.  I guess for people for whom the woods is scary, this movie probably was.  I'm not only not scared of the woods, even at night, I like it!  I like not being able to see street lights and hear cars and to listen to the sounds of crickets and owls and critters rooting around in the dark.  It's very relaxing.  So I just kept thinking, ""Jeez, these kids just need to go back to Boston or wherever.""  Sticks and stones aren't very scary either.  There are lots of them out there.This was just an updated ""Little Red Riding Hood,""  ""Goldielocks,"" or ""Hansel and Grettel.""  I wasn't very scared of those either as a kid.  There just aren't enough big, bad wolves out there to make them threatening.  And all of the witches I know I kinda like.  They're a bit strange sometimes but basically nice.  I sure don't know any that eat children or make them stand in the corner.

Given the number of people who want to video everything, it is a real equivalence.The story is simple - three young wannabe film makers head into the woods to make a documentary about a local legend, the Blair witch.  (Blair is previous name of a town.)  Then things start going wrong.  As we are told at the start, this movie was constructed from what they had filmed before they went missing.Whether you like this movie will depend, at least in part, on your desire for a movie to have a beginning, a middle and an end.  This story doesn't really come to a conclusion, it just finishes.  But what is important is that the film is about three people in a difficult situation, and looks at how they react and interact as the situation goes down hill.The chances are you won't be sitting on a fence with this movie - you'll either love it or hate it.

I wouldn't go into my room alone and slept with the light on. Now I am a wimp when it comes to scary movies, but this movie scared me so badddd. It is great if you have early teen kids that haven't heard about it and tell them it is real just to give them a good scare. If they get way scared I wouldn't do it because they will freak.

I like the fact that it didn't take a huge budget and gobs of cartoonish computer animation to make this a great film. Lets face it, up until the time most folks realized the video footage was NOT real, this movie made a serious buzz. I think what makes this so intense is when we are made to believe that what is going on in the movie actually happened, and could happen to anyone---this is real horror folks. It was a brilliant idea to give us the impression that this really happened to three college kids, via found footage of a trip into the woods gone wrong.Nay-sayers are just too used to the Hollywood computer-animated garbage we see too much of nowadays.	5.0	Loved it	2010-07-20	2	1	1

It's so obvious that she is doing it on purpose! As a viewer  you find yourself putting up with this nonsense because you think there is  a payoff somewhere.

I went into  this film in the theater not knowing what to expect, and because I knew  that it was an extremely low budget film made on hand held cameras, I was  not disappointed with what I saw. People who complain about this moving  being amateurish are missing the point - amateurs MADE this movie.  Considering the equipment they had available to them and the very little  amount of money they spent, they did an excellent job. I was rivetted to  the screen for the entire length of the film and anyone else with realistic  expectations would be also. If you are expecting all films to be  special-effects extravaganzas with explosions and aliens then yes, you will  be disappointed.

There were really only 3 characters in the whole movie, and the set was just the woods.  In fact, we never even saw the Blair Witch or any special effects at all.  If all movies were like this, it would get boring real fast, but because they're not, this is a one-of-a- kinder.  It is also impressive how resourceful the movie was, on such a tiny budget yet making so much money in the theaters.I kept waiting to see the witch face to face and what she would do to the kids.  But it is what we can't see that is the scariest.  The three get lost in the woods just when someone seems to be messing with their minds at night.  It gets scarier and one of them disappears in the night without a trace, all his things left behind.  They later hear him screaming in the night but don't find him until they discover an old beat up abandoned house.  Just then, they seem to disappear or drop dead or something, because we were viewing what they were viewing through the cameras they had rolling, which dropped to the floor.  Abrupt, yet good, and definitely scary ending.  So what is the Blair Witch, anyway?

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A326TH21VE2NPY	Andrew Kotwicki	After careful observation, I have come to the conclusion that &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; is the best film of the year!  It was the most original, most brilliant, and most frightening.  They also made history  with the now-famous &quot;apology&quot; scene.  What sickens me is the  accumulation of negative criticism this film took from morons who are only  scared by special effects and gore.  People who didn't like this movie need  to go to proctologists and find their heads!  What in the hell is there not  to like?  I loved every minute of this film!  Every frame was a work of  art!  I am also proud to say that the dizzy camerawork did not make me ill,  as many people have said.  Plus it was kept simple, and was more down to  earth than most of today's escapist, hollywood horror films(or should I  say, horror film wanabees).  The other thing that shows how moronic the  people who didn't like this film really are, is that people thought it was  real, and then hated it when they found out it wasn't.  I knew that it was  fake(meaning created by directors with actors) the first minute I heard  about it, and yet I didn't seem to care.  Just because it's meant to feel  real, doesn't mean it is real!  They say people who watch movies know the  difference between fantasy and reality.  &quot;The Blair Witch  Project&quot; proved that statement wrong.  And last but not least, was the  fact that people who hated it said it wasn't scary at all.  How stupid!  This film will scare you to the point where you heart is pounding so hard,  it's liable to explode from your chest!  It's not like those movies who try  to scare you by making you jump out of your seats.  It's a realistic,  gradual buildup of fear that reaches a peak of pure terror that never  resolves itself.  When I say this is the best film of the year, I don't  mean it's an Oscar caliber picture.  The Academy Awards don't nominate  films like that.  A less worthy film like &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is  more likely to have a shot at an award.  At first I was really upset by  what people said about how &quot;bad&quot; this film was, but now I don't  care anymore.  &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; is an incredible film,  shown to a world where idiots buy the tickets.  In terms of the  quality of the tape, it's great.  Film aficianados need not worry about  finding a letterboxed edition of this film, because it wasn't shot in  widescreen.  It also includes all three of the trailers, and newly  discovered footage(actually a deleted scene).  It's definitely worth the  price, and even if you don't buy videos, buy this one!  It's well worth  every good, hard earned American penny!  Hopefully, they(Artisan  Entertainment) will have the good sense to release &quot;The Blair Witch  Project&quot; in a box set, with loads of extras.  That would be nice to  own a collecter's edition of the year's greatest film!	5.0	The best film of 1999!	1999-10-22	1	0	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2I17T9XB6LSGW	Andrew McCaffrey	"Judging by the critical response to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, it appears that this is a film that is virtually impossible to feel ambivalent towards.  People seem to either love it or hate it, and to express their view with a fiery passion and a complete lack of understanding about how the other half could possible hold the opposite opinion to themselves.  Well, I place myself firmly in the ""loved it"" camp.  Actually, to be more specific, I place myself firmly in the ""absolutely scared stiff by it"" camp.  Twice I have watched this movie.  Both times I did so at night and with the lights off.  Both times I allowed myself to become completely drawn into the fantasy.  And both times I was utterly freaked out by the end of it.The plot of this film is too widely known and too skimpy for a summary to do any good.  Everyone knows that the movie consists of three young people going into the woods to make a documentary about a local witch.  Lots of potential newcomers probably know how the film will end before they even sit down.  But the success of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT lies in its execution rather than its foundations.  The fear and terror striking these young people comes across as completely believable.I was completely absorbed at all times by this film.  The characters are flawed people, and occasionally annoying, which might turn off some viewers, but to me it made them that much more realistic.  These people slowly realizing the predicament that they're in and becoming more and more freaked out by the strange and supernatural-tinged events is what made this movie work for me.I don't think there is any way of knowing how any individual will react to this film, but if the reviews are any guide, the reaction will be a strong one.  To anyone who hasn't seen this, I'd recommend going in with an open-mind and not allowing oneself to be distracted by any real-world occurrences.  If you do end up on the ""love it"" side of the fence, then you may just find yourself with a new favorite horror film.  If you end up on the ""hate it"" side, well, it's a short film (less than an hour and a half), so you didn't waste all that much time, and at least now you'll know what everyone was talking about."	5.0	Consider Me Terrified	2003-03-23	4	1	3

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A295YBJ2KROL8Q	Andrew Shih	This movie was shot by amateurs, but since what you are seeing is supposed to be the footage of a movie which was shot by amateurs, who better than an amateur to play an amateur?  Actually, this movie breaks new ground on a number of fronts, one of which is to involve the cameraperson in the movie.  And so if the camera is off center or sideways or shaking or even dropped, you can tell how the cameraperson is feeling and since this is a horror movie, the point is to show how very very scared everyone is, especially the person who is holding the camera.Another effective aspect of the movie besides the way it was shot is the way it was cast.  The characters/victims are not professional actors/actresses giving canned responses.  They are again amateurs, and the way in which they talk and act in the movie is very realistic.  The audience can identify with them.Finally, the situation that arises in this movie, that of losing the map and getting lost in the woods, is a situation which almost anyone can relate to.  Even if you haven't actually gotten lost before, the fear or the momentary nudge that maybe you don't know where you're going, or that you can't trust the person who is leading the way or who is entrusted with the map is certainly a psychological dynamic which we are no doubt familiar with.And then there are those sounds and shadows in the middle of the night in the woods when you are camping out, which you can't quite identify but which look or sound eerily reminscent of something which you have seen or heard before . . . .	5.0	Where's the map??	2002-08-12	1	1	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A13RYFCGR7AM7E	"Andrew Thompson ""a.k.a. Jake Kincaid, Jack of..."	"Let me start by saying that whilst I always try to keep my reviews spoiler free, in this case I may touch upon a couple of plot points that the six of you out there over the age of ten that haven't seen this might get something given away...so you are duly warned:)Onward...I really have trouble deducing why this little offering is so maligned...I mean, sure, it had some rough camera work and a couple of plot holes...even with that, it's somewhat (like a million light-years) above the standard low-budget horror film, and it had the audacity to have believable characters and a clever pre-release marketing campaign that alluded to the 'truth' of the story...How DARE they try to make us believe this is true and then turn out an almost devoid of blood or gore or even a glimpse of the 'monster' film?To my mind, genius.Having grown up in the southeastern United States, and having spent several years of my life in the military, I'm no stranger to being in the woods at night...from as far back as I can recall, my family has always camped (and by that I mean tents, backpacks, the ground as your bed and so forth...sleeping in an air-conditioned Winnebago with a 'fridge, microwave, toilet and a DVD player, while perhaps fun, is NOT camping, friends), hiked, and spent a LOT of time in forests.Given that, I can tell you in no uncertain terms that when the fire has ebbed to coals and the moon has made the branches above you into cobwebs of shadows, you hear some pretty freaky stuff...and I mean even if you HAVE spent a lot of time in the outdoors.This movie touched a nerve with me (and a lot of people I know) because it took us to a place in our own experiences where we wondered just what the hell was tramping around out there in the darkness while we sat vulnerable, far from help or home.  Add to that a well thought out, well-executed plan to get the theme of the film into our consciousness, and you have a recipe for just out-and-out terror that did not require big special effects, spurting blood, or hideous 'thing' in the woods to cause a considerable ""pucker-factor"".People complain about the camera work; yes, it's shaky...it's supposed to be amateur filmmakers...are there any of US out there who have impeccable camerawork in our OWN home videos?  In times of duress?Hmmm...don't see many hands....In my opinion (for what it's worth), I think the erratic movements added to the tension; we experience the frantic, panicked moments with the characters, building the dread and suspense.People complain about how the characters get so hopelessly lost...well, though it isn't implicitly expressed, I thought the impossibility of walking for hours and winding up in the same spot was the influence of the witch on their minds (which could also explain the whole ""map"" fiasco; although that is one point I DID find stupid) or their compass...I mean, if we're going to accept the concept at all, why not assume she can do that?  There ARE places on the earth you can go where compasses go haywire, and magnetic/geothermic undercurrents cause disorientation and confusion in humans...these woods are supposedly cursed and under supernatural sway, so I don't think that's too big a hurdle to jump.Lastly, a lot of people gripe that you don't actually 'see' anything...well, neither did the characters!  Just as with the 'hand-held' camera work, THIS is the beauty of it; we the viewers share/suffer the SAME experience, SAME terror, SAME despair that the characters themselves do. Let's be honest; if in the last ten minutes some haggard mannequin or CGI 'witch' had come bursting through the wall and eaten the camera, would that have REALLY been a better film?I honestly feel, as my title suggests, that expectations were too high, people figuring to see some James Cameron-ish take on the haunted woods story, and were left feeling cheated; in other cases, I think some people are just PO'ed that they bought into the 'truth' of this story and were so completely suckered...but regardless of either of these possibilities, I feel the film is very effective...very scary.My recommendation:  Turn off ALL the lights in your home...watch the ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" mockumentary (included) first, and really open your mind to the concept...THEN watch the film.If it doesn't creep you out, you're made of some pretty stern stuff indeed."	5.0	I think a lot of folks are hacked off that they got duped...but isn't that the beauty of a horror flick?	2010-10-12	8	5	3

I was disappointed after the first hour, but still decided to watch til the end. Finally, I could conclude that the movie is just a total waste of time (for me as an audience). It projects to me a low budget hodge-podge mix of video excerpts made by amateurs. I know that the intent of the movie is to similate a documentary taken by the three students - however, it doesn't have the impact on me as a viewer. The constant panning and shifting of camera angles just makes me dizzy. And there is little, if at all, any scenes or storyline that makes the viewer feel involved in the movie. I know that I would only be scared if and only if this is genuine documentary. Unless one is capable of operating on the precept that this is a genuine documentary, otherwise, I guess you would be equally disappointed.Nothing is revealing to me in this movie, and I deeply regret having wasted my time watching it.If you are looking for a thriller, horror or suspense movie, I would not recommend this.	1.0	Terribly disappointed!

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AAQOHC2YPMO5G	Angelo	This movie is very good, the people say that is bad, very bad, other is the most scary movie made ever. I dont agree with any of the two, the movie is scary: yes, but is all a psycologist terror, is a auto induced fear,  made for think that you are the protagonist, or to put yourself in the  situation of the guys, that could be easy done because the cameras used are  8mm, and the takes are in first person. the movie is bad: no, but not is  the best of the best in terror movies, Could be much better, if only was  produced by a great big studio like Universal, or Warner. But that is the  magic of the movie, the idea that this 200 million dollars movie, was made  wit only 22.000$, is incredible the effort put by this guys in the movie is  amazing, and that make you believe that you could made a movie too. Is an  incredible movie, that you need to have in your collection. Because is the  movie that will make a new era in movies. Believe me.The video is good  not perfect, but very good, the sound is much better than the video, but is  only surround 2.0, the extras are very good. for this movie of course.I  recomend this movie.	4.0	An incredible effort	2000-04-28	1	0	1

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A11RU07SQDXVLP	Anon	First here I am going to discuss why I loved this movie, then I am going to go over why some people did not like this movie (for those of you who haven't bought or seen it yet, so that I might aide you in deciding).Much like the Billy Rae Cyrus song, &quot;Achy Breaky Heart&quot; this  seems to be one of those things that you either love to death or hate with  a passion. While I hated the aformentioned Cyrus song, I loved this movie.  The plot was mildly creeping in the beginning and built up into something  so utterly terrifying that it set itself in my spine and gave me chills for  hours after watching it (and as an avid horror fan,I am immune to horror;it  is very rare something creeps me out in the least, and this terrified!) The  premise was original in itself: a movie done like the unedited footage of a  documentary (not of people making a documentary, but only footage that  would have been seen by their two cameras--one black and white and one  color. Many complain of the characterization, use of profanity, and  unstable camera shots: the characters were actually quite realistic as  college characters and any complaints are probably because the characters  weren't the larger-than-life pretentious people of most movies; the  profanity was part of the characterization and it's frequent increase was  an accurate way of showing the increasing horror of the characters; and the  wobbly camera shots were there because the cameramen had no tripods and  were filming much like you'd expect a film to look for a college project. I  saw one reviewer complain that it looked like a college students  product--that's not a complaint, that the ! POINT! of the movie.  I  believe the primary cause of disliking this movie is a result of a weak  suspention of belief or the viewers unwillingness to try to suspend  disbelief. If everything must make perfect sense for you. the way things  socalledly do in the &quot;real&quot; world, don't watch it (or just about  any horror movie for that matter). If you know you are going to be biased  against it because you go into the film knowing it is untrue though  presented as if it were, don't watch it. But I must say that not to watch  this movie or not to be able to suspend your disbelief will cause you to  miss out on one spectacular film.	5.0	Grand achievment in Cinema and Horror	2000-01-29	3	2	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2IQ5VBY9E5ACD	Anonymous	"The movie started off with interviews of folklore about the ""Blair Witch"", and so a woman and two guys set out in the woods to look for evidence of the Blair Witch. They find more than they want, but they can't find there way back to civilization. Imagine what would happen if you were with two other people in the woods, lost and hungry. What would you do?The movie has too many ""F"" words in it that take you away from suspense. I found myself rolling my eyes during every argument and quite frankly, I found it boring. However, when ever suspense picks up, I found myself entertained and somewhat scared as if I was with them.The biggest problem is the hand held camera. It was too shaky and every once and awhile I had to look away from the screen because it was too nauseating. Because the camera was so shaky, we never actually see the Blair Witch or any other thing for that matter.So, why watch this film if there is just a bunch of screaming and cursing and shaking and no viewing of the Blair Witch? Because there are scenes that make your heart pound and the feeling of seclusion can make the viewer feel helpless. I would recommend watching it for free if you can find a way, if you can't, don't pay for than 5 USD."	3.0	"Creative, but it lacks things to make it ""good"""	2010-07-11	2	0	2
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2UKC6QFG9L5GV	Anton Ilinski	"When I first heard about ""Blair Witch Project"" it already hit the screens worldwide and I knew about the advertising campaign that it was just a hype. When my friends invited me to the cinema I was skeptical: a movie shot on video? For 30 thousand? With just three rookie actors? C'mon...But when I watched it in theater (by the way one of the few films I saw in theater) I understood it deserved its credit, although I was not actually scared. But from that day on I was waiting till it comes out on video because I knew this kind of  movie is better watched home, alone, quietly, in the dark. And when I finally laid my hands on the DVD edition and watched it as I thought it had to be watched, it scared the crap out of me. ""Blair Witch Project"" is like a home-video and when you watch it in theater with crowds around you it loses its effect. But at home when you're in the dark alone its claustrophobia and unbearable suspence do their job. I recall some scenes when characters heard that laughter during the night or the final scene and they literally sent shivers down my spine and left me breathless. And video-camcorders deliver indeed! I never had such a strong feeling all that's happening is REAL. After such movies you begin thinking that maybe there's really something or somebody that dwells in remotest corners of our vast woods. For example, it's a well-known fact that we examined just about 20% of all oceans on Earth and we might just not know what lives in other 80%. The same thing about forests - who can tell for sure what's in there?Anyway if you saw ""Blair Witch Project"" in theater, bother to buy the DVD, because it's a whole different thing. A whole different feeling and a whole different scare.By the way it contains a very good documentary about the Blair Witch, and you really start wondering: and what if..."	5.0	A FILM TO WATCH AT HOME	2005-11-17	3	2	1

You don't see many movies like that around, well maybe they're making more now, but it's not the same. For those who criticize this movie to the deaths, think about this. Wherelse have you heard of such a genious advertisement like this?: Three missing kids who took a trip in the woods for research with a tape left behind (and actually have movie posters and a website on the ""missing students"", a journal, photos, bits of clothing and leftover items from the students). Whoelse had their actors ad-libbing many lines in the movie? Whoelese had a ""document"" ont he Discover Channel about the Blair Witch to further advertise their film and to further make yourself question whether or not this whole situation is real or a hoax? Whoelse had thousands, maybe millions believing or questioning if this really happened?? Whoelse spent such a small amount to make a movie and ended up with millions in the end? The thing that I love about it is, all this was done by an independent film crew. It really shows that indie films have it's credit for being original and CREATIVE. Something that tends to lack in Hollywood today.I went to an Independent movie theatre to see it and I thought it was good seeing it in the theatres..very realistic and I thought the concept of ""less is more"" was a very good choice. This movie, as you rpobably might know is about three college kids on a venture in the words to find out more information about the Blair Witch to see if she was real or a hoax. Now, I don't scare easily, and I wasn't very scared but I do admit I was a bit creeped thinking about it. You have two main groups where some say they were scared as all h3ll and then you have the other group that say they weren't scared one bit.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A9X9Y3ISJ5XON	a reviewer	"It is the dawn of a new era for horror fiction and movies alike and the arrival of ""The Blair Witch Project"" brings a refreshing  outlook to modern horror. The new concept in horror film design and direction used in this feature focusses on a TV-style reality show (i actually hate TV reality shows) to make it believable and truly scary to the viewer. As this is a relatively new technique in shooting a good horror film, much remains to be seen if this is really effective and if it does match the wit and imagination of the earlier classic horror movies. Only time will tell but the making of a horror film becomes incredibly difficult as previous and current ideas and original storylines get employed, outtakes used as stock footage and subsequently look as if it has been cloned. The Blair Witch is a new kind of creation using more subtle tactics rather than excessive blood and gore in delivering a harrowing experience to the viewer. In the film, the presence of 17th century eerie objects planted in the dense woodland depicting the practicing of witchcraft translates well onto the screen and the whole fear factor comes from the feeling of being lost in the wilderness and not knowing if there is someone or something lurking around the corner that will leap out from nowhere. There was a lot of potential for this film to be rated amongst the best and as being a truly classic horror, however the acting and the dialogue slightly brought the film downwards due to the incessant swearing from the three plonker characters in film and the running time is under 90 minutes not enough to be considered an epic. Their use of a hand-held camera constantly shaking may make you slightly film/motion sick and the use of black and white footage rather than full colour can make the difference between an effective film or one which is necessary in order to see the full hog of terror unleashed within the boundaries such as blood and possibly an actual witch.It is definitely a like it or loathe it type film depending on how you perceive horror as spine-tingling. If this film doesn't appeal try watching ""Halloween 3:Season of the Witch""-there maybe more chance in identifying the witch in this film than in Blair Witch.The DVD is a good transfer in 4:3 aspect ratio (as seen in U.K. region 2) with good documentary and extras to go along with it.

First they tell us that this 2 tapes which make the whole movie, were found a year after and were real and these 3 students were never been seeing again. So you wanna tell me that after some time they found another tapes by these students? that's just the proof for hollywood taking all of our money out of our pockets, and some people actually buy it...

Mike threw the map to the river because it didn't help? yeah, right... need I say more for the stupidy of this film? and I've read some reviews here which say that the ending was shocking.

But watching in DVD was better to see as bonus the documentary that was created for SciFi Channel. It was so realistic that it made me disbelieve that the movie was created and not an actual incident. Another interesting fact is the amount the makers spent - ~$20,000 and made millions of dollars - just be creating the hype.I realized one thing - either you will like it totally or you will hate it totally.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A272G1285GP5QO	Ary Luiz Dalazen Jr.	The Blair Witch Project scared people all around the world and brought a new type of horror to the screen: the fear of being lost, of being hunted down, practically dragging the entire audience in this relentless ride of  mounting tension. The basic idea is simple but original. Students decide to  make  a documentary about a haunted forest. Acording to the local's  inhabitants, there is something out into the woods. Heather, Josh and Mike  don't know what it is, but they are willing to discover. So they penetrate  into the woods with their cameras, and never return. Just their footage,  the images of their harrowing last days, is discovered.The first question  raised by the film's popularity is: why this low-budget, independent flick  turned out to be the year's most astonishing hit?what is so scary about it,  how can a movie that didn't cost more than twenty thousand dollars bring  primordial feelings like tension and distress closer to the audience?there  is just one answer: is what you don't see here that makes all the  difference. The Blair Witch Project is the kind of thriller that works  differently for each person in the audience, bringing your most primitive  fears to the top.You don't know what's going on, but by hearing the sounds,  by seeing some images, by hearing the scream and panic of the students you  can deduct that something very terrifying is happening, and that will put  you in touch with your most personal fear: of being lost, or maybe of being  buried alive, or being chased by a murderer or a maniac. The Blair Witch  Project is one of the most challenging movies I've ever seen, and it  deserves to be included among memorable masterpieces like The Exorcist and  Deliverance. Just one film, beyond The Blair Witch Project, made people  shake with the same intensity, Hellraiser, Clive Barker's  adaptation for  his own novel. There are two scenes that will always make me nervous:  Heather Donahue asking for forgiveness  in The Blair Witch Project, and a  woman holding a man inside her arms, kissing him and sucking his blood  through his mouth in Hellbound:Hellraiser 2. I highly recommend The Blair  Witch Project's  DVD by Amazon, you won't be sorry!also check it out  Hellraiser and Hellbound:Hellraiser 2 , they are all good buy!	4.0	It will make you stay away from the woods!	1999-12-04	0	0	0

The original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Psycho' and 'The Silence of the Lambs' to name 3 others that have redefined the horror genre. But this is very different. I first saw this this on the big screen and it scared the life out of me. I then saw it again and again on video and it gets better and better. The sign of a masterpiece.I agree with many of the positive comments on this film. The concept, acting and execution is all immaculate. The central premise is so deceptively simple that the filmmakers fully exploit the audiences lack of knowledge. This film excels supremely on so many levels. What are we watching? Who has compiled these videos? Is the Blair witch male or female? How can people get lost in modern America?, as Heather says in one of the many spot on comments that highlight the naturalistic acting on display.Ultimately, it is the ambiguity that is totally unsettling. Add to that the alternating between Video 8 and 16mm film recording, the bizarre sounds at night and the total feeling of ""being there"" through the handheld camera, and this film will freak you out. In addition, the setting of this in semi dense forest that seems innocent enough, but as anyone who has been in a forest like that knows, a voice from 500 m away can sems like 10 me away due to the topography and tree dispersion. The seemingly innocous shots througout the film, that turn sinister with a change in light and from colour to black and white.Finally the whole ending which has enough terror to occupy many nightmares, really highlights the filmmakers mastery of the medium. Unlike the three previously mentioned films, which have a relieving sense of finality in their final frames, ""The Blair Witch Project"" allows no such relief. See it and the more you really see, the scarier it is."	5.0	Scary, unsettling and very very smart	2005-05-30	15	9	6

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AHNDWVX0WCDXG	Barbara J. Webb	I had a hard time making a decision about this movie.  Up until the end it  looks as if there's a good chance that these people's college classmates  followed them into the woods and played pranks on them all the way through  the movie.  But yet there is always the element of fear of the unknown  present.  And we all know that your mind can imagine things that are more  frightening than anything in real life.  Or not.  The final scenes in the  old abandoned house though, are just simply terrifying.  And that's what  this movie is about.  The movie does everything it was intended to do.  The  film looks amateurish--and these were students from a college class.  The  camera work is enough to make you seasick--once again, amateur students  from a college class.  The acting is unimpressive--see above.  In other  words, this film does everything it is supposed to do and that's why it  deserves to be recognized.  Yes, there is something in the woods.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ	"Barry ""Barrybgb"""	What scares you?. What sends chills down your spine or the hair on the back of your neck to stand up?. There are many different answers here for many different people. There are certain things that just naturally generate fear. But the thing is, whatever is there scaring us might come from our own minds. Is something really there?. Is someone really in the dark corner in the basement?. Are we imagining it?. That's what this movie has really going for it. We have some noises and mysterious things in this film that help us, but mostly, the fear we get from this movie is what we think up in our heads. Nothing is really seen. It is what's not there, or what we don't see, that is the true terror of this film. The movie, shot in documentary style, is about three friends who head off into the woods with video camera to try and find the infamous Blair Witch. During their trip, they encounter ghostly happenings in the woods. Once our young campers are there, it only gets worse. Maps are lost, and the tension between the three rises. The movie can be highly annoying at times. The shaky camera will give anyone a migraine. The girl doesn't help matters any either. She is so loud and obnoxious you wished she would get it. The movie is scarier as an afterthought. Not necessarily while watching it. When it's over and you look back on it, it is  creepy. More so than when it's actually happening on screen. This brings us back to making it up ourselves. We aren't shown things and have no idea what exactly happened. We create it ourselves and that can be even more frightening than what is laid out before us up on the big screen. It does, however, have one hell of a classic ending tho. I do have to give credit to the filmmakers on this one. They should be respected for trying to do something a little different and risky. Five stars for that. This is a film that you either love it or hate it. There doesn't seem to be any halfway in that area. While it is not something I absolutely loved, or would view over and over again, it was quite an interesting trip into psychological terror. Like I said, you either love it or hate it.	3.0	Don't Go Into The Woods!!....	2001-10-23	0	0	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2KM7J2DNEG61C	B. Bowling	I now have a new standard for measuring bad movies since seeing the Blair Witch Project. After 6 months of hype, I saw the thing and couldn't believe how boring useless this film was. Later that week, a friend talked me into  seeing The Haunting, another really bad &quot;scary&quot; movie. I rated  The Haunting by saying that I would still rather see it 3 times than Blair  Witch 1 time. Now my scale for bad movies is the BWP Meter. The Bone  Collector, for example, was not SO bad. It just had some big plot holes and  characterization problems. I'd see it 5 times before I'd see BWP once;  therefore it's 5 on the BWP Meter.	1.0	Gives Me a New Appreciation for Bad Movies	1999-11-24	7	4	3

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	ASYM4A70K9OMU	beachbutterfly	"The Blair Witch Project isn't horrifying. It isn't terrifying... it isn't even remotely scary. I think one reviewer put it best ""the count of 'sesame street' is scarier."" And how true is that?Okay, I'll happily admit this: the acting is absolutely brilliant. Three actors were given all the equipment needed by the producers to film the movie and literally improvised the whole thing. I have to hand it to them: their acting skills are absolutely superb and by far exceed standards of movies budgeted at a mere $40,000. This being said, that was perhaps the only reason why I even bothered to give it three stars. The story on the other hand...I almost peed in my pants...laughing so hard.I'm going to be blantly honest. This movie did not scare me a bit. The producers relied mainly on shaky camera angles and good acting (which is often what most people do) in order to pull of this film. The plot, while somewhat realistic, showed that the creators had little...creativity. The story sounded something out of a pre-teen urban legend rather than a disturbing real-life news caption.The story centers on three college students who travel into the Virginia woods in order to further shed light on the Blair Witch Legend, while filming a documentary that highlighted their trip. After getting lost by some of the most extroadinarily stupidest circumstances (One of the travellers throws out the map just to further piss them off), our happy campers continually find themselves waking up every morning to the sight of stick dolls and strange rock formations assembled beside their tents (Oh my God, watch out! It's the attack of the stick dolls!).After continually losing it more than once (and losing one of the travellers), the final two approach a deserted house and find their supposedly fallen camper standing in the corner...until the lights go out.Like I said before, this movie isn't scary. I admit that I did enjoy watching it; it's got a good thing going with it's make-believe documentary but by no means scary. Watch it for the acting; not for the scare factor."	3.0	Your shaky camera angles don't scare me!	2005-01-14	6	2	4
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2WDSO1DQZ7J03	behet@stud.uni-frankfurt.de	&quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; is more an interesting experiment than a really scary movie. It tries to frighten its audience by minimizing the distance between the viewer and the characters in the movie. To achieve  that goal the creators of TBWP pretend to show us a documentary. What they  don't offer are any tricks to manipulate the viewer. This would have been  absolutely necessary since we all know that this is actually a fictional  film. After a while we are getting tired of seeing three students walking  through the woods doing stupid things. The directors could not not make me  identify with the characters and they also did not find a way to tell their  story visually, like Alfred Hitchcock used to do. He was able to create  suspense through his visuals alone, almost like in a silent film. He always  succeeded in making his protagonists interesting enough to make us  sympathize with them. TBWP is the kind of film that gets less interesting  with each viewing, the best proof that it is not a great film.	2.0	Unlikely to become a classic	1999-12-14	3	1	2
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2582KMXLK2P06	B. E Jackson	I have to be honest- I didn't like the Blair Witch Project.  First of all, a group of young people going around with a homemade video camera just isn't scary to me.  It comes off like a bunch of people pretending to be scared during a weekend of wild partying, and it's hard to take the storyline seriously.  The cast supposedly going around interviewing people about the activity in the woods didn't work for me either.There was NOTHING scary about those woods.  Those woods are identical to the woods right in front of my house.  Imagine a day with no wind blowing, it's perfectly calm, it's about 10 minutes after sunset, you're out there with a video camera walking through the fields and through the trees, and you hear something.  Know what it is?  It's not a ghost or a witch- it's a rabbit, pheasant, deer, squirrel, raccoon, groundhog or fox.I was talking about this five years ago with someone on a message board.  He said the Blair Witch Project was the scariest movie ever, and I told him that if he lived where I do, growing up surrounded by the same setting that takes place in the movie, he wouldn't be scared either.  It's true!  You wouldn't be scared either.I wonder if this movie was inadvertently responsible for turning the entire horror genre into a complete mockery.	1.0	crappy story and atmosphere, and overall waste of time	2009-10-10	11	2	9

Featuring annoying characters, an inexistent plot and a gaping hole at the end, this 90minute home-video details time spent alone in the woods and human reaction to &quot;spooky&quot; sounds and sights. This movie features a young women who is probably the most annoying character to ever grace the screen, who can only boss around her fellow campers for the first half, and becomes a sobbing, emotional mess for the second half.

A few years earlier, a better movie came along, but through some tragedy, isn't getting the kudos it really deserves.Blair Witch is rambling, the cameras are so shaky that some audience members would get nauseated during a viewing, and the scares, although bona fide creepy, come few and far between. If you want to see a superior movie with a very similar concept that is much better constructed, less shaky and ultimately more creepy, pick up a copy of THE LAST BROADCAST.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1OUEDUZ4AHVIZ	"Ben Stubbs ""Horror / Metal Enthusiast"""	"I really wanted to love ""The Blair Witch Project"" when I went to see it at the cinemas. I'd read the Internet hype after it came out in the U.S. back when not everyone realized it was fake. The reviews called it ""the scariest movie since the Exorcist!"" and stories of people screaming and crying in the cinemas really brought my expectations up to an unattainable height. I'd talked it up to myself as well as to friends and colleagues, telling them all that they had to go see it when it came out. But by the time it actually hit our shores (I'm an Aussie), everyone had been made aware that it was fake and all the magic of early reports had been replaced by negativity and mocking. But I lined up, paid my cash and went in to find out what it was all about.I must admit, that first sitting was the epitome of disappointment. The camera jumped all over the place and made me feel frustrated and a tad ill. The constant fighting of the characters got on my nerves more than a reality TV show. But the worst part of it was that I didn't find it at all to be scary. Here was this so-called holy grail of scary movies and people were actually laughing in the cinema rather than screaming. I walked out feeling completely let down after months of looking forward to the event.A couple of years later I decided to watch the movie on DVD. I picked a cold, dark night, turned all the lights out, took the phone off the hook and sat down on the couch. I'd made the decision that I was going to watch ""The Blair Witch Project"" the way the first viewers had seen it. Forgetting everything I'd ever heard about it, I would delve into it with a clean slate. I'm really glad I did! While I didn't completely freak out and lose my lunch in fear, I certainly found a new appreciation for it. In fact, if the viewer simply allows themselves to become involved in the situation on screen, it can become quite psychologically jarring. I really believe one of the reasons that so many hated the film, myself included, was due to both expectations and an inability to actually put themselves in the place of the actors. To actually experience the movie! It certainly didn't help that the audience I saw it with was laughing. If you can take that step, then ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a very effective and clever film. So the question is, is it OK to ask the audience to commit so much of themselves to a film for them to be able to have an emotional reaction (other than boredom). The more I think about it, the more I think the answer is yes. The problem has been created over an extended period of time, with more and more blockbuster movies that require nothing of the audience whatsoever. No thought, no belief, no experience...nothing! That being the case, when a movie such as this one comes around, it's understandable that people may just find it boring as they have lost the ability to actually ""experience"" it or in some cases, simply choose not to let themselves.No, I haven't done a complete turn around and gone from a Blair Witch basher to a Blair Witch lover. It's not a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination. The epileptic camera movements still make it hard to watch, the inability to hear what's going on in the forest and some of the bickering still gets on my nerves. But I must admit it all makes it far more realistic and it's all very intentional to get the desired effect. The acting is actually pretty damn good. The fact is that in all likeliness, normal people would fight and cry and scream and carry on exactly the same way these guys do. There are moments of absolute terror in their voices and sheer emotion on their faces which is a credit to the actors. I can't say there's anything I could suggest they should have done differently that would make it any more realistic than it is and for that reason alone I consider the movie to be a success. It is a movie to be experienced alone in the dark though. Nothing else would do it justice."	4.0	A unique study in terror that requires a little something from the viewer.	2006-09-18	8	6	2

I hadn't seen this movie in years, yet a silly nightmare made me think of it again.Blair Witch is like that.  I saw the movie after it opened and laughed at the end.  I didn't hate it; just thought it was rather silly...interesting, but not terrifying.  But the film had done its trick by taking hold of my mind...touching the psycholocal triggers of terror lying in wait.A few years ago I was hiking in a familiar woods with my husband.  It was a bright fall day...nothing at all sinister about it.  But we found ourselves lost for a bit...playing around and not being careful...oh, let's go this way; it's a short cut to the trail.  Well, we stomped around for an hour and found ourselves BACK WHERE WE'd STARTED.  That chill of terror ran down my back, like biting down on a bad tooth, hitting the raw nerve...Blair Witch.  Needless to say, we calmed down, figured out how to get safely back, but the terror was real for awhile.I recently re read Bill Bryson's funny and well written A WALK IN THE WOODS..about hiking the Appalachian Trail.  The chapter about the Maine woods is especially graphic...reminding me again of Blair Witch.America is full of wilderness...even in Maryland.  And the mind is full of imaginings and nameless terror.  Like Hansel and Gretel and the Brothers Grimm, we fear the woods, the unknown, the horror waiting around the next bend.	4.0	The haunting of Blair Witch	2005-08-10	3	1	2

AND OTHER SCARY STUFF!I have not seen this movie in a while, but every time I do I get completely creeped out.I have to confess, my experience with this film initially was almost perfect. So, that could be the reason for how I react to it so strongly. In the Summer of 1999 I was just getting geared up to move temporarily from Orlando FL to Seattle WA for my job. I saw the ""documentary"" on tv (I believe it was on the Sci Fi chanel). I thought the ""documentary"" seemed kind of hokey. But when I went to the internet to check it out a little bit I found just the original web site. It hinted at the movie, but mostly seemed to coraborate the story being based on fact. Well, you know if it is on the internet it must be real! So, off I toodled to Seattle. Well, to try to make a long story short, I got pretty engrossed in my work and never made it to see the movie and frankly did not think much more about it. Well, I guess because it was an indie film and the time of year, it came out on video right around Halloween.Okay, so picture this; the last thing I remember was this might be based on real events, I am up in the rainy, cold Northwest surrounded by strange forests (believe me the wierdness of the Northwest as it is portrayed in things like Twin Peaks and various bigfoot flicks is every bit as creepy as it seems in those movies) and it is a dark and rainy halloween night and I pop in this movie to watch. Holy crud, I am covered with goosebumps just thinking about that first time! Now I don't know if I want to go outside in the dark alone for a while. Needless to say, it scared the Bejeesus out of me.It reminded me of times when I have been camping and had things go wrong with equipment, like leaking tents, broken spleeping bag zippers and how frustrating those simple dilemnas were, much less the occasional moment or two of feeling like you might be lost. They were also good about letting the characters actually do some fairly smart things to try to figure out how to get to where they felt they needed to be. It made the realization that they were basically going in circles all the more frustrating and chilling. Then of course the final scene in the house, that just finished me off right there. I could not go to sleep for a really long time. I had to go around the house and turn the lights on and watch something upbeat and cheerful just to try to unwind. I was right there in that house with her by that point and I could just imagine the horror she felt. A near perfect horror movie experience. On top of that I got to laugh my rear end off when I heard it was all a total hoax. How perfect.

I do not recall anyone who was there at the time calling the movie 'boring', or 'silly'.  I don't think that the large number of negative reviews that I read about this movie now are representative of those who saw the movie when it came out in 1999.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A7NBCYVPM10U7	Bill Jones	[Please note: I would have given the video ** 1/2 stars if that were available.]&quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; is probably the creepiest  film I've seen since the remake of &quot;Invasion of the Body  Snatchers&quot;.  The movie is about three student filmmakers who wander  off in the Maryland woods while filming a documentary.  What we see is  cleverly presented as the footage that was found a year after their  disappearance.The beginning of that footage introduces us to the Blair  Witch legend.  We see Heather (the director, well played by Heather  Donahue) interviewing people from the town of Burkittsville (formerly  Blair).  They tell us how, years ago, the bodies of seven children were  found in the woods.  Legend has it that the woods are still haunted.  Most  folks seem to avoid the area, but not our filmmakers who are quickly seen  shooting away in the midst of it.  And even though Heather claims to know  exactly where they are, it's soon evident that they're lost.  &quot;We'll  all look back at this and laugh heartily, believe me,&quot; she says.  But  her partners Mike and Josh aren't buying it.  And Mike reminds her that  &quot;I agreed to a scouted out project.&quot;In the midst of all the in  fighting, the trio discovers a number of scary things - piles of rocks and  stick figures that could only be man-made.  They also hear sounds at night  in their tent that MIGHT be a deer, but sure sound more ominous.The  low-budget &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot; was a big hit at Sundance and I  really like how the movie shows Hollywood you don't need big special  effects to make a good horror film.  It's not necessarily about what you  show us, it's more about what's implied, what is, in fact, not shown.  The  movie's last shot is a good example of this.  I've been thinking about it  for a while now.  And the possibilities it suggest make the movie even more  terrifying.	2.0	Creepy film, even on video	2000-07-07	2	1	1

The idea of 3 college kids saying 'lets go make a movie about a witch legend' and then things turn in unforeseen ways sounds plausible. You follow their progress from naive bravado to chaotic madness, as the 'witch' is playing mind games with them. The swearing, that upsets some viewers seems natural for scared, tired & hungry people. If you took some urban slackers who didn't have clue one about survival, - (they didn't even bring some extra candy bars?) -, they would start behaving like these 3 do.My problem with the movie is I think these 'no conclusion reached' endings are a cop on the plot. Furthermore they act like such fools I lost all empathy for them and didn't care if they lived or died because I was so tired of hearing these jerks.

Now if I understand this correctly, the directors of  this movie had a limited budget for creating this poor excuse for a movie,  but then they all of a sudden have a ton a money for promoting the film? I  think anyone who purchased this movie should take the DVD or VHS tape, put  it back in its original packaging, shine it up real nice, turn it side  ways, and stick it.....never mind!	1.0	Dumb Witch Project	1999-12-12	4	1	3

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1YUA1ZMB2Q1XJ	Boy	"First off, do take heed of the top two reviews posted here: ""Give Credit Where Credit's Due""  and ""IGNORE THE STAR RATING HERE..."" - they are even-handed, articulate, and amusing.As for me?  I say with confidence that BWP obviously ranks among the all-time great Horror films.  You can check out my Amazon ""Listmania"" list, entitled TOP 24 HORROR FILMS, to get an idea of my tastes.  Anyways, I'm a life-long Horror geek, and BLAIR WITCH is top ten without a doubt.  But bear in mind that I'm talking about smart-scary films that actually succeed in creating a palpable feeling of anxiety in the viewer.  Gore's a bore and cheap thrills are just that.Now I was fortunate enough to actually see this sucker in the theatre, and it was the only time in my movie-going life that I found myself literally slack-jawed and gaping at the screen as the credits rolled.  My date was also a bit freaked out by the end, and absolutely convinced - as so many others were - that the film was a true story, or at least heavily based on one.  Such was the power of The Project when it first stormed US theatres.So disregard the inappropriately low star-rating and the horde of befuddled clue-frees who posted them.  Horror films only really work when experienced under the right set of circumstances.  Ideally you should be alone in a darkened room with the film playing on as large a screen as possible.  If you're going to watch with others, try for as few as possible, because even one vocal disbeliever can disrupt the spell for everyone.  And why waste time with a Horror film if you're not willing or able to at least TRY let yourself be seduced by it?  Open yourself to this one and you'll be forkin' AMAZED.5 stars for those who dare..."	5.0	#1 Horror Film of the '90s (in Spite of Amazon Customers' Wildly Misleading 3-Star Rating)	2014-02-14	14	14	0

Don't expect a normal movie though, because it  definitely is not normal. Towards the end of the movie, I was didn't think  any ending could possibly live up to what the rest of the movie had set  up.. But I was completely wrong. This movie's last few seconds make up the  most chilling ending I have ever seen. It is one of the few movies where  the ending is the climax. If you liked the feeling you got when you saw the  ending of Planet of the Apes, you'll love the end of the Blair Witch  Project even more.	5.0	If you want a review, READ THIS!	2000-08-08	3	2	1

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3H4TIVTTA5IBB	Brian A. Wolters	"The Blair Witch Project is a scary movie indeed. Personally, I have gone out looking for local ""scary"" legends and at times, spooked myself silly. The Blair Witch project gave me a chance to investigate another ""local legend"" from the comfort of a theater seat. There are some really good chills in this film and it starts out quite nicely, but it is all ruined by a lack of intelligent dialogue.The movie opens where our ""three brave heroes"" prepare for their trek into the woods to investigate the ""Blair Witch."" The interviews with the town locals are very interesting and believable. This builds up the mythos behind the legend. The interview with Jim King about Rustin Parr was extremely convincing and brought a since of realism to a film that we know to be fiction.Then they head into the woods. Everything starts out just fine; in fact, the cast even seems a little disappointed. In their second night in the woods, they start to hear sounds and mostly pass it off as deer. Then the next night and the nights to follow, more strange and insidious things happen.The best thing about The Blair Witch Project is that you never quite see anything scary. All of the scares come from the acting, sound and lighting. The cast does a good job, especially Heather Donahue. Despite her Razzie award, she is the strongest in the cast. The sounds in this film are quite chilling and the scene where they hear the kids laughing really brought goose bumps! And the final scene stuck in my mind for days!All of this excellent material is ruined by poor choice of words. Sure they were scared and most of the film was improvised, but the profanity reached a point of ridiculousness. It seems as if they used profanity as adverbs and adjectives rather than for pure emotional impact. This definitely was the most disappointing aspect for this film.The DVD is excellent! It is packed full of extra's including the Blair Witch special, deleted scenes and trailers. The ""special effects"" on the menus are also well done.All in all, I was scared and chilled by this film, but I cannot recommend this film because of the unnecessary profanity."	2.0	Profanity Ruins A Truly Scary Film	2001-05-02	8	2	6
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A6FLU4CR9WW5G	Brian Davis (fluffsterbrian@hotmail.com)	While many critics hailed this movie as refreshing and innovative, I had quite the opposite reaction. For me, low budget and independent do not have to be synonymous with complete lack of filmmaking technique, which is what I saw in  this grossly overrated film.  Examples of films done on a shoestring budget that  show dazzingly skillful and inventive technique include &quot;pi&quot;, Sam Raimi's  &quot;Evil Dead&quot;, and Michael Almerayda's vampire flick, &quot;Nadja&quot;.  &quot;Blair Witch&quot; on the other hand, looked like it could have been made by  any minimally competent group of college film students or cable access producers,  once given the original premise.	1.0	Surprisingly Overrated.	1999-10-08	0	0	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2IEW97KQB5G5	Brian G. Joy	"When I went to the theatre to see this film, I was very excited. The only things I had heard about the film (other than the story's basic premise) were, first, that you don't see anything and, second, that it was scary. These are two of the best ingredients in making a good horror film. However, I was incredibly disappointed with the results. Not only do you not see anything, you don't FEEL anything-other than boredom. The first time I checked my watch, I thought that it had been going for at least half an hour. However, much to my dismay, only ten minutes had elapsed. By the end of the film, I was only too glad that the characters were dead because I could finally go home.The responsibility of this film's failure doesn't lie with the premise itself, but with its execution. Rather than a descent into raw terror, this film felt like a bad (as if there's any other kind) ninety minute episode of...THE REAL WORLD, only worse-much worse. There isn't enough background information given about the Blair Witch to even know for what they are looking when they get lost in the woods, so instead of being a search gone wrong, it comes off as nothing more than the aimless wanderings of three city kids who haven't a clue about how to manoeuvre through the woods. As a result, the film has no focus to drive it forward other than the argumentative whinings of three self-obsessed college film students.Because there is very little given about what is supposed to make the Blair Witch such a frightening phenomenon, the tactics used to frighten the film students sounds like nothing more than silly pranks of teenagers from the next camp. No matter how lost a person is, piles of rocks and a group of large stick figures (one of which has become the main logo of the film) do not incite mind-altering fear. The nighttime assaults aren't any more impressive. They sound like nothing more than deer wandering near the campsite. Hardly the stuff of nightmares. Again, how does any of this stuff connect with the Blair Witch? Also, the three students' deaths are not related to the insufficient material on the witch herself but to other legends of the woods.One last main weakness of this film was the weakness of the dialogue. The dialogue was completely improvised, and it is sadly obvious. The only reason for the ""R"" rating is because of the prolific use of a favourite four-letter expletive and nothing else. I expected some explicit language because the characters are college students. However, I also expected a larger vocabulary BECAUSE THEY ARE COLLEGE STUDENTS. This redundant reliance on this word exposes the weakness of the players' ability to create fully fleshed out, three dimensional characters.The one good thing that I can say about this film is that they did an excellent parody of pretentious art students. This is the only reason the film got even one star. However, this five minutes of success cannot make up for the other 85 minutes of dismal failure. If you don't have anything better to do with a stormy evening, don't get this film. Instead, do something infinitely more frightening: stare at a blank wall."	1.0	A clever gimmick cannot save this pathetic mess	2000-06-05	0	0	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3HLRR2FL9E5DP	Brian	"This is one of those ""almost"" movies. Like some other films I have seen in the last several years, ""Blair Witch"" had a great concept that was thoroughly squandered by cheap execution. The production would have fared so much better had it been filmed as an actual movie. But, instead, we are forced to sit through an endless barrage of spliced together footage from a video camera that is really no better than watching the next-door neighbor's home movies.A great many of my friends recommended this to me upon it's initial release, heaping unprecedented amounts of praise at it as one of the most frightening and altogether brilliant movies they had ever seen. I really must beg to differ. I have seen literally hundreds of other horror and suspense thrillers in my thirty-four years of existence, and ""The Blair Witch Project"" doesn't hold a candle to any of them. How anybody can rank it as a worthy contender to ""The Exorcist"" and look themselves in a mirror without laughing staggers my imagination.The overall concept was fantastic, as I said. Hence my two-star rating. Aside from that, there really is nothing further I can honestly recommend to anybody about this film. The $40,000 budget speaks for itself. Rent, if you must.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A17BPHKWU54K5T	Brian Maki	When I heard some people and critics compare &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; to &quot;The Exorcist,&quot; my blood curdled in anticipation of full-body jolt of adrenaline and terror. When I actually saw the movie  (at a Drive-in Theatre), my thought was, &quot;You have got to be kidding  me!  THIS is what all the hype was about?&quot; My wife agreed with me  that &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; is the most over-rated piece of  cinematic blunder we have ever witnessed. Had no one listened to the  critics and saw this movie without any prior influence or expectation, it  would have descended into the dark abyss of movie making trash. But put  together a massive marketing effort bent on deceit with a cynical, naive  public hungry for conspiracies and tall tales involving witches and murder,  you have one recipe for box office success. Now as much as I was let down  by this movie, I enjoyed it for other reasons. The three stars I generously  award have nothing to do with the scare quotient, believe me!  Worth  seeing, but don't think this thing holds a candle to &quot;The  Exorcist,&quot; one of the most terrifying movies ever created.	3.0	Interesting But Definitely NOT SCARY!	1999-12-27	4	3	1

It was not a well thought out or filmed production. They go into the woods, lose the map, get lost  trying to get out, find an abandoned house go in get killed. Here is a hint  for everyone- if you go into the woods and there is a creek on your right  then it should be on your left if you are backtracking your steps, and if  you find the house you were warned about dont go in. Another down fall of  this movie is its determination to compete with porn films in the language  used during the whole film. There was no script- just a cussing  competition. It was filmed with a regular handheld video camera and very  rarely has a steady screen. It is filmed mostly in the dark with only a  flashlight for lighting. A really hyped up movie that fails to follow thru  with the promise of &quot;terrifying&quot; or &quot;suspenseful&quot;.	1.0	Home Video Garbage	2000-01-12	2	1	1

On the outside it advertises &quot;See the  snake headed boy&quot;, marvel as &quot;The ape women from borneo changes  shape in front of your eyes!&quot;. But.. when you pay your 50 cents to get  in you see a paper mache model of some supposed &quot;strange but  true&quot; discovery made in the darkest of Africa in the 1880's by Sir  Carmelo Ifoundit, and the ape women turns out to be some guy in an old 20's  type costume in old ladies pajamas &quot;dancing in the dark&quot;You  pay your money, you get your thrills!The movie is a wonderful homage to  P.T Barnum.

(I can't explain this  particular &quot;film device&quot; as I'm bound by Amazons policy not to  disclose the entire plot!)All seriousness aside, it did have some  &quot;spontaneous&quot; character development, and the premis for the film  was somewhat intresting, Friends get idea for a film, Friends go out in the  woods to film it, Friends run out of smokes (this turns into a major test  of thier Friendship),Friends get lost, Friends get cold and wet, Friends  get scared, Friends get ?????)Buts as far as being a &quot;lost in the  woods and scary things happen&quot; type of movie, The movie  &quot;Delverence&quot; was more much more frightening (Ned Betty!  squeal,squeal, now that's scary! who needs witches, just give me a  banjo!)Should you see it? why not, (I see them all!) after all, it's  only money. Just keep saying to yourself &quot;It's only a movie, It's only  a movie, It's only... 6 bucks&quot;And for those who have already seen  it, &quot;Go stand in the corner!&quot;Best RegardsP.S Maybe for a  hallowen costume we could all wear stocking caps and backpacks!

I've seen more captivating home movies than this. Three naive and maladjusted college kids get lost in  the woods. They lose their heads as much because they're lost as because of  the supposedly spooky shenanigans goin' on.  How original is it, to say  nothing of how UNscary it is, having a forest of human stick figures, a la  Burning Man, appear in a wooded clearing? Why should groups of rocks be  scary or significant? Why do muffled sounds in the forest night engender  fear rather than simple acknowledgment of nighttime forest reality? Who  knows, and who cares, after witnessing this great hype job!

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3HTX1NOTTWERP	Busy Body	I have seen The Blair Witch Project a total of two times now, and have been scared to death each time I watch it. I tell myself I shouldn't watch it, but I do because I like to scare myself, like most lovers of the horror genre do. Judging from reviews on here, people either love or hate this movie. I am in the love camp, because there are so many reasons to like this film. It's unlike anything that has ever been released before it and it stands out as unique and original. In a way I can understand why some people say this film did not frighten them one bit, but they are obviously the people who like their horror films with blood and guts shoved through their screens. I, on the other hand, am a horror fan who prefers the suspense and dramatic tension that is built up in a movie, as my imagination can run wild and create something as violent and horrific as it wants to. With The Blair Witch Project, you are free to make up your own mind about what is going on. There are no set rules. Things are evil and chaotic, and that's what's so good about it. Remember this is the film that cost a mere $22,000 to make and grossed more than $240,500,000 worldwide. That's a box office ratio of 1:10,931. Little did the filmmakers know that they would make $10,931 for every dollar they spent on the film. Ka-Ching indeed.In October 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch. A year later their footage was found. This film is supposed to be the actual footage of what was found a year later, but it obviously isn't because it's been made as The Blair Witch Project. However, the acting in this film is so incredible and realistic that you are drawn into their world and can't help but believe that it is truly real.The three filmmakers are Heather (Heather Donahue), Josh (Joshua Leonard) and Michael (Michael Williams). The film starts with all three travelling on their way to Burkittsville. When they arrive they interview several residents of the town and ask them what they think of the legend of the Blair Witch. The responses are varied. Their happy spirits and jolly personalities only set the shock factor higher for later on in the film. Later on after they have captured enough footage they park their car and set off into the woods, beside a cemetery. As time goes by, however, Josh and Michael begin to realise that they are lost. Heather is the leader of the pack as it was her idea to make this documentary, and she insists they are not lost. Through the day it seems just like a normal forest, but at night, things starts to get really creepy. They are miles from any civilisation, and the lack of any natural light is incredibly spooky.The way The Blair Witch Project is filmed in 100% documentary style is absolute genius. There are no special effects, no sound effects, no special lighting, just one camera that moves up and down a lot. Heather is the narrator for most of the film, and is desperate to make this adventure a success. While Josh and Michael insist they are lost, Heather says they are not. She is too wrapped up in catching everything on video that she doesn't pay any attention to where they are. The first ten minutes are highly enjoyable, and their trek into the woods is great. Once nightime falls, however, things really go bad. As the trio huddle in their tent at night, they hear strange noises outside. Crackings of twigs and smashing on stones outside scares them to death. As the viewer we can't see anything except the odd tree, so we don't know how far away the evil is. We don't know what it looks like, we don't know what it's doing. Everything is shrouded in mystery and ambiguity that we can't help but let out imaginations run wild of what could be going on, and that is the genius of the film.Josh gets lost one night, and Heather and Michael are livid wondering where he is. They believe he's run off, but we as the viewer know he has probably being snatched. Heather's final speech is a cinema classic, and the ending in the abandoned house is extremely disturbing. Listen to what a resident of the town says about what the Blair Witch did to children in the house, then watch what happens at the end of the film. It's extremely chilling. The man standing in the corner as Heather films him. Who is the man? Josh? Or Michael? Or someone totally different? Heather suddenly remembers what the resident said, and she knows what's going to happen to her as the camera falls to the floor and she screams.OVERALL GRADE: 10/10The only bad thing about The Blair Witch Project is loose-lips Heather and Josh. They say the F-word more times than you could count and it really starts to grate after a while. If you've been living under a rock since autumn 1999 and you haven't heard of The Blair Witch Project then I urge you to watch it. It stormed into England's Top 10 100 Greatest Scary Moments Ever last night on UK TV, and I have to agree. You will either love this film or hate it. I love it, because it's original, ground-breaking and a total masterpiece in gothic horror cinema. Anyone can spend millions of dollars making a Hollywood blockbuster and make it not scary in the slightest, but you can't deny that this is a very scary movie once you take away the monsterous hype.	5.0	If You Go Down To The Woods Today....	2003-10-27	8	5	3

But I really liked this.If you like Hollywood cookie-cutter horror movies, this is definitely NOT for  you.  It's a very unique, experimental movie, one which had elements from  my childhood nightmares (getting lost, being in a strange house,  etc.).Why it works, I think, is because so much is unseen or vague,  leaving much of what is going on to your own imagination, sort of like  Jaws, where the most intense scenes are those where the shark isn't even in  sight.  Hitchcock understood this concept, that less is more.Unfortunately, today's viewers (especially younger ones) are jaded by  the glut of gore and special effects in modern Hollywood horror movies,  which may explain the negative reviews (worst movie ever?  Not by a  long-shot).  Gore is almost non-existent in this movie...but be warned, I  believe the &quot;R&quot; rating comes from the use of the &quot;F&quot;  word, which becomes more and more prevalent as the three filmmakers get  more and more lost/scared/frustrated.I was a little disappointed at the  ending initially, but the movie stuck with me for weeks after (I also had  trouble falling asleep the night I saw it)....give it a shot.	4.0	Gave Me The Creeps	2000-01-07	53	46	7

Yes, it relies on suspense and the unkown to drive your fear. Yes, critics love it. Does that make it something you should buy? Nope.The characters are unbelievable, getting lost in the woods in Maryland? And next to a river no less? It is insane that someone could be that stupid. The suspense created through the filming is nice, and a good break from the teen-age horror flick, but it is ruined by the horrible acting, bad dialogue and ridiculous precept.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2E3F04ZK7FG66	calvinnme	"It seems many people dislike this film because they think the entirety of its reputation lay in the confusion/publicity campaign generated at the time of its release as to whether it was a real film found in the woods of Maryland that documented the disappearance of three college students or whether it was just a movie. What made this film scary in 1999 and scary now is what you don't see and what you think you hear as well as the growing paranoia and fright of the college kids lost in the woods over a period of days that find - as they run out of food and supplies - that they are just wandering in circles.The very last scene is particularly chilling, and if you already know how it ends it will kill some of the fright factor for you. However, this film just proved in 1999, as it still does, that you don't have to fill a horror film with wall-to-wall state-of-the-art CGI visual effects and shocking violence in order to be scary. I personally think the horror genre has been much worse off since Jason and his ilk first invaded the movies back in 1980 with graphic violence that is predictable and, quite frankly, boring. As much as I like this movie, the sequel, ""Book of Shadows"", is just awful. Its makers Hollywoodized the original concept and thus made it completely incoherent and unwatchable. Avoid it at all costs."	4.0	Much better than its reputation	2007-06-24	4	4	0

Perhaps you would rather have watched another  soulless, cheap-shock gorefest that Hollywood is typical of churning out,  than an original, chilling, inventive and very effective horror film? Just  because the film's directors tried (and succeeded) to break the mould of  modern horror and gave you something that left you shaking as you walked  out, rather than relief at the common `happy' ending, and didn't spend  millions on special effects and gore, doesn't make it a poor film. Nor does  it give you the right to scorn it. In fact, saying those things about the  film leave you looking rather stupid and uninventive.	5.0	This is in response to Rich Ensleys 'comment' of October 29t	1999-10-30	0	0	0

I was one of the lucky ones who got to see this wonderful film before it was decidedly established as a &quot;movie&quot; rather than a documentary.From the first few moments in, the film is pervaded by a dark atmosphere, the townspeople's descriptions, the eerie camerawork, Heather Donahue's lilting voice....The film is extremely scary, and revolutionary. No big budget special effects here, no computer animation, just some college kids out in the woods....The film works on many levels, and personally a little swearing in a film never bothered me very much. It merely adds to the realism.Everyone can appreciate this gem on some level, by the end, you will be left openmouthed in horror...	5.0	Don't hate it just because its popular.....	2001-02-21	5	4	1

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2YXMN40D7WTGP	casualsuede	The hype on this movie was incredible.  When this movie played at Cannes,  it was said that people were throwing up and running out of the theatre.  Artisan Pictures (who bought the rights to the movie) announced it was due  to the fact that it was sooooo scary. Having watched the film, I think  maybe because it was because the film was soooo shaky....Anyway, this  movie is very good in it's setup.  Three college kids, led by Heather, are  making a documentary for a class project.  They want to do a documentary on  the Blair Witch Curse and on a cold, sunny weekend,grab their stuff and  head to Blair, Maryland.  After getting background information, they decide  to head off into the woods and find the home of the Blair Witch.  They  begin to lose their way, and their sanity as they begin to hear  indescribable noises late at night and become paranoid, blaming each other  for the mess they have gotten themselves into.The movie concludes with  them finding an old abadoned house and ends with their demise when they  finally get to meet (speculated) the Blair Witch herself.  This of course  is not a spoiler, because the premise of the movie is that we see the  demise of the students based on the cans of film that were found in the  woods a year later.The cinema verite style of this movie is refreshing  and the grainy film stock is a departure from all those slick horror movies  that tend to show you everything ahead of time and leave you with no  imagination that have been released in the 1990's and 2000.  Most of the  fear WILL be based on your imagination and if you lack one, then this movie  will be downright boring.  Many people did not like the movie on this  premise alone.  However, since I have a very active imagination, my heart  beat did rise above it's usual 70 BPM on a few occasions.The  characters were all believable as film students and act very naturally.  I  don't know if this is because they ACTUALLY were amateurs and were just  being themselves or because they are GOOD actors.  Heather Donohue does a  very good job as the self-confident team leader who breaks down by the end  of the movie.The only complaint that I had was that the movie was  becoming a little repetitive by the 4th act and that the low budget of the  movie creates this &quot;home video&quot; quality that I will never fully  recommend anything more than 3 stars for.  However, for a cheap thrill that  out of the ordinary, try this one out.  For me, it was worth buying used,  but I don't know if I could spend the money to buy this new....Rating: C+	3.0	Controversial, not due to content but marketing....	2000-08-17	1	0	1

Well, it really dissapointed me a whole lot. I mean these three people go into the woods to make a documentary  video thing. They hear wierd stuff at night and they get scared.. But when  u see it- it isn't that scary at all!  The so called scary part only  lasts for like 20 seconds. The movie just hangs in the middle it doesn't  finish right. A question leaves in your head- Huh?  What the heck just  happened?  The camera didn't stay still and that bugged me the whole time  even though they say they did that to make it more realistic. but guess  what? It wasn't that realistic and the whole idea of going to the woods and  filming stuff was corny+ it didn't make any sense. I mean get real. Who  would be filming stuff when a person's missing!  Or the time when wierd  noises are coming up to you!  I would probably run for my life Without the  cameras and stuff. Who wouldn't? Overall, i would just like to say this  movie was toooooo over hyped!  I have been more impressed with  'Goosebumps'!  you should rent it from a video store and just watch it  once.

It is an ingenious idea, with fantastic human elements, and it should give any young film student hope for their projects to be widely received in the future.The reason the movie works, it because of what we CAN'T see. The twig men, creaking woods, and loud rock hits during the night are as effective as the gruesome SFX in The Exorcist. Two very scary movies, for completely different reasons.And about the cussing:GET OVER IT!! What would YOU say if you were hopelessly lost and pursued by an omniscient and omnipresent witch? Probably not ""Jimeny jillikers!"" The cursing adds realism, even if it's a tad overblown.And the viral campaign was awesome when the film was released. Fake websites, documentaries on TV, and missing persons posters? That's almost better than having the incident be real, because you can appreciate just how clever the whole charade is!Bottom line. The acting is impressive, especially for an unknown film, it is entertaining, and it is downright scary. And everyone complains that they weren't scared once they found out it wasn't real.

You can feel how isolated they are all the while knowing that no matter what kind of progress they make in their attempts to get ""unlost"", these campers aren't going to have a happy ending. It almost feels as if you're actually with them (maybe sitting on top of their camera) instead of the comfort of your chair and safe environment.

The plot is remarkably simple, and similiar (read King's The Girl Who Loved  Tom Gordon for an interesting variation), unwary travelers wander from the  beaten (aka SAFE) path and, one by one, fall victim to someTHING in the  dark shrouded woods.  The unseen and unknown are where the thrills come  from, and the shaky hand held camera work gives the viewer the  feeling/sensation of being an active participant in the unfolding events.

No seen violence or gore, just a chill inducing experience that sticks to the skin, for a long long time! The woods combined with the audio effects at night are some of the most disturbing things ever captured on film. This is a movie that relies entirely on mood and atmosphere alot like the good genre films of the seventies and eighties.

You have 3 annoying college kids on ""a project"" in the woods, and their enthusiasm quickly evaporates, in part, because they have to ""rough it""-----that means, they have no electricity or running water. So they bicker a lot, whine a lot, and yell f***-you a lot at each other. It's 2 guys and a girl, and the girl is supposed to be the leader of the project. She's the one who is the most annoying. And the guys make fun of her. Well, the group finds ""signs"" in the woods which scare the crap out of them, such as piles of rock and twigs. Gee, really scary. NOT! While watching this move, I nodded off....it was that silly and boring.The end was very confusing. If it was done that way as a lead-in to a sequel, well, Okay.

Nothing wrong with stars like that, but theres no way this film would have worked with them.3) Think about the Black & White effects. Only other B&W; film I can recall in recent years thats actually been distributed to most theaters was Schindler's List - and its a hit too. (In fact, SL is in the top 10 or 20 all time great films. Admittedly, BWP isn't in the Schindler's List class of course, but see what B&W; can do for a story ???)4) There was absolutely NO GORE. No blood...nothing. And still scary as he**.5) Its gotten over 1500 Amazon reviews. I've seen much more famous films with far less than that.I have to agree with several other reviewers who say that those trashing the film seem to have issues with the way the story was marketed (in fact, staged:). Yeah, a lot of us do feel that we were taken in by internet hype about a ""blair witch"", but c'mon...shouldn't grown people know deep down inside that ghosts and witches are ALWAYS made up or otherwise mere legend?

It does feel real because it is soooooo badly filmed that it could only happen in the amaeture hands. If the director insists on the unfocused scenes to make it  REAL then there  could have been a better plot and more sensible dialogue without sacrifice  its sense of reality.  By finish watching the film, it makes me feel like a  fool.  Surely lots of films make people feel like fools by the end, in an  amusing way. But this film is neither amusing nor scary.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AYCBRL8DNQR1R	Chris Benton	This has to be one of the most over-hyped, misleading, and underwhelming movies I've ever seen. I wish I had a time machine so that I could get those 87 minutes of my life back. I can say nothing good about this film.  There was no suspense, implied or otherwise, the &quot;unscripted&quot;  panic was too predictable, and the time spent just waiting for something to  happen did nothing to heighten the dread I was supposed to feel. But my  biggest complaint about this film is the horrible camera work. Before I get  flamed, I understand perfectly well that this film was supposed to be shot  as if it was by amateur filmmakers, and, therefore, was supposed to be edgy  and off-kilter. But I felt my gorge rise every time I dared to glance at  the screen. I left this movie with a splitting headache and an intense  desire to throw up. Many in the theater with me felt the same; in fact,  when the film was over, many people booed! (Well, those who could still  stand up.) I went into this film avoiding as much of the hype as possible,  expecting to be terrified on a psychological level. (That has to be better  than gratuitous special effects, right?) This film didn't deliver. It was a  great premise that was wasted on a dull 87 minutes of celluloid. I know I'm  not the only one who feels this way, so hopefully my post will give the  other Blair Witch haters out there the courage to tell the truth about this  tragedy of a film.	1.0	Boring, plodding, nausea-inducing crap	1999-09-07	2	1	1

But you have to understand that they were trying to make it look realistic.  It  wasn't scary, but it was fun to watch.  I had a couple of problems: (1)We  didn't see a witch.  Not even a glimpse of a foot or anything (2)The town  they lived in was never known as Blair (3)At first, it made me a little  upset that the creators tried to make us think it's real.  But now I see  the beauty of it.  This got such bad reviews from people because they don't  fully understand it.  Whether you like this movie or not, you have to  respect the creators for trying something new and unique.  I'm tempted to  get a copy of the DVD.

I disagree.  Would the ending of Empire Strikes Back have had the same impact  if the ending was already blurted out all over the plcae, and your friends  dropped subtle hints onto the actual story line of the movie?I saw this  movie in the theatre the day of its theatrical release, and I went in cold.  Not only by the end of the movie was I absolutely terrified of the woods,  I was so convinced of the acting given by the three actors, I thought  &quot;Man, if they are acting, they are going to win an oscar for  sure.&quot;The psuedo-documentary feel is really deepens the impact the  movie has with such small details as Heather asking a man's permission to  have his image placed on camera.I highly recommend that you view this  movie, but I highly recommend that let yourself form your own opinions.  It  is quite conceivable that many people didn't understand the tie-in with the  ending, and just wrote the movie off as cheesy, and then spread their  opinion to others, who has already judged the movie befoire seeing it.The Blair Witch Project definetly completes the kob it aspires too,  creating a pyschological feeling of terror and anxiety.	5.0	Take this up for a good scare	2000-05-26	1	0	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A34N82YHLUOVKN	Chris Q.T.	I thought the idea was fantastic, yet would have been scarier if it was ultimately about some freaked out killer instead of witches. (It's just more believable). Without a doubt the movie serves ample doses of the worst  fear of all...the anticipation of seeing something while seemingly lost in  the woods. I'm sure tons of people who dislike the movie constantly whined  throughout the movie &quot;Show us something! &quot;. But that's exactly  what made it good, the night scenes kept you on the edge without pushing  you over. Once you see a horror scene it brings with it a sense of finality  and the movie will lose the excitement more and more each time you see it.  This one plays on your own fears and manifests upon them. I couldn't help  but to put myself in with the group throughout the movie and think of what  i would do. (besides slapping Heather silly). If the conversations would  have been a little more realistic and the fear the characters showed more  tense and desperate, this would be a 5 star flick. But there wasn't enough  time to develop a relationship with the characters so I couldn't root for  them. This should have been a longer movie with more character development.  still a good flick though if you see it late at night with the sound jacked  up......	4.0	Great idea, good execution	2000-04-06	3	1	2

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A119ENICLFTCVG	Christopher A. Petro	So they release a great movie on DVD. They even take advantage of the format and throw in some extras. Lost footage, etc. They even put it in a  decent keep case, not a cardboard one. But then they put it in  &quot;Fullscreen (standard)&quot; format (a euphamism for removing half the  image). What a waste. They don't even give you the option of flipping the  disc over or using the second layer to get the entire picture.  This is  inconceivable to me, because you can release both on one dvd.  There are  very few dvd's released without a widescreen transfer, and many do not even  include one of these pitiful pan &amp; scan transfers. If I hadn't already  opened this (who would have thought a &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; might  be pan&amp;scan?) I would return it. I may still try. Everyone should make  sure that Artisan knows that people who buy dvd's do it because they want  to see the movie in as close to the original experience as possible, and  that means a faithful transfer.	1.0	What the hell was Artisan thinking?	1999-10-31	2	1	1

Those few that did see it were keeping their mouth shut to support the independent film makers or were afraid ot being linched if they said how much it sucked.  All in All this movie is one of the most impressive practical jokes ever played on the mass movie watching audiences.The little thing that sparked life was the ""rumor"" that this was actual footage and it was a real human to witch encounter.  Which later was known as 'you thought that was real'...HA HA we got you.  Knowing this was a script and planned movieI am one of those people who got sucked in to the hype and went to watch it with my wife.  We sat near the middle of the theater.The lousy sound made me go ""what"" for most of the movie.The horrible bouncy camera work gave me a severe headache and made my stomach sick.But what did it for me was the stupidity of the ""characters""  I knew this was NOT a documentary since no real person is stupid enough to go in to the woods with NO REAL MAP except for a hand drawn that one of the idiots throws away, NO WEAPON duh your chasing a witch, NO PHONE OR CB who you gonna call when you need help, NO GPS this is the modern age.I can not think of any movie that made me say to myself ""what are you doing idiot"" and ""don't go there stupid"" and the like. But being a EX-Boy Scout I was astounded with the lack of survival skills and poor preperation.What no one brought a GPS, but they brought plenty of film.What no one brought a 2-way radio, but their cameras have plenty of battery life.What you don't follow the sun or river to civilization but you follow blood soaked clues and stupid looking stick figures.What you don't bring a gun but you want to go say HI to a witch.When both my wife and I walked out we said...""what the hell was that"".  I personally stood outside for half an hour convincing people this movie was not real and was one of the worst pieces of filmatography I have ever seen.

In my opinion (which is correct of course:) The Blair Witch Project is the best horror flick to be made within the last two decades. The Sixth Sense, The Ring (American version), Finale Destination: These films are not scary. Entertaining maybe, but definitely not scary. The Blair Witch may not make you scream or jump out of your seat with fear, but it gets under your skin. It's one of those films that people should put themselves into and imagine what life would be like for them in a situation such as this. What the Blair Witch lacks in visuals is more then made up for in sheer originality. The Blair Witch Project is a creepy and disturbing film that is far greater then what most people give it credit for. A most excellent film indeed :).	5.0	The Blair Witch Project	2004-07-08	7	3	4

I was very dissapointed.  It had a lot of umm points that would seem to lead to a  climax then it would die down.  I expected to see a witch or at least a  figure of one in the movie, but I didnt see anything.  The movie didnt  really come to a real scary part until the end.  The end was kind of good  so it wasnt all bad.  After I took my girlfriend home, and drove back to my  place by myself thats when I started to really get scared.  I imagined  myself in their situation and it started to freak me out.  When I got home  and went downstairs to go to bed, I coudlnt help but play the last few  scenes back in my head, and that really scared me.

""The Blair Witch Project"" was among the three most talked about movies of that year, along with ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" and ""The Sixth Sense.""This movie was all the rage when it first came out. Many had no idea that this movie was actually a fictional story filmed so that it would look real. Some would say that when all the hype is taken away, this movie isn't good. I beg to differ.I pretty sure that when I went to the theater to see this film when it first came out that I already knew it wasn't real footage of three teens being stalked by the Blair Witch. So I was simply viewing the movie for what it was - a realistic depiction of a fictional story. It was done quite well. After viewing it on DVD, I still say it packs a punch, especially if you watch it late at night alone in the dark by yourself (with the sound turned up).This movie is unjustly maligned by a lot of people, and deserves more credit than it has received over the years. It seems like every movie done in a similar style, such as ""Diary of the Dead"" and ""Cloverfield,"" is referred to as being filmed ""Blair Witch style."" That has to count for something. ""The Blair Witch Project"" set the standard for making films with a ""hand-held camera"" style that tell fictional stories portrayed as non-fiction.This movie is scary when taken simply for what it is."	4.0	A Better movie than some make it out to be...	2009-03-14	2	2	0

Can you name one other horror movie that is all out and doesnt have any restrictions? This movie wasn't filmed on a set, it was filmed really in those woods, and these people are probably the best actors in a horror movie i have ever seen. What is so scary about this movie, is that the characters are themselves, and in most movies characters have to try and act to be scared, and usually you can tell they are scared, and usually do stupid things, but in this movie, everything is so realistic, and their abilities to be scared (acting) truly make you feel as though your expierencing this for yourselves.

A film that comes out that defys standards for a hit and rips them apart in the process. Also another inevitable thing would happen: the film would get so built up on hype and mass marketing that everyone will label the film overhyped and not worth it. This is a love it or hate it film.The film is &quot;apparently&quot; about 3 filmmakers: Heather, Josh and Michael as their documentering a local legend known as the Blair Witch. They start out in town asking locals and getting stories then they set out into the woods to see a cemetery. However, they start realizing they're getting more and more lost. Tempers and accusations fly around meanwhile there's strange noises at night.Keep in mind some things might get unbearable: Josh's sailor mouth(count how many &quot;f**k's he says) or Heather's screaming(she's mainly behind the camera so when she screams, she's directly near the microphone).That ending will always stay with you. One hand it will disappoint you: You're completely clueless about why he's standing in the corner or what makes the camera fall and what happens afterwards, yet it's disturbing at the same time: it leaves you with a sense that something did happen and that it happened and you were helpless and unable to do anything(kind of like watching a family member of something horrible done to them and you were unable to help.)It's certaintly worth taking a look and watching the special features where they went a long way to actually pass this off as fact(honestly, when you saw them on Leno and tv didn't you imagine somebody was going &quot;THEY FOUND THEM!&quot;	4.0	Nice little film but don't eat anything before	2003-08-19	2	0	2

You have to see the movies with your walls down,  if you keep your distance from what's happening as most horror fans do, you  may not be scared. I didn't think it bothered me until it was over and I  had to go home. That night I didn't sleep, not from fear, but from the  feeling of going through a traumatic experience and it kept going over and  over in my head. If you haven't seen it yet, don't let others effect you  seeing it. You will either love it or hate it but you have to see it to  make up your own mind.	5.0	first time a horror movie got to me	1999-09-29	0	0	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A6J7UPYUI96XO	"Cory T. Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic"""	Back in '99 I saw this film in the theater and hated it. I got more laughs out of it than anything, because of all they hype surrounding the film at the time, I was expecting something totally different.This movie IS something totally different. And I never came to appreciate it until several years later when I picked it up at a yard sale on VHS. The movies were on sale and I had to buy three to get the discount, so basically it was free. A few months later, my girlfriend saw it in a box and wanted to watch it, so I did. That was back in 2002, and I've since come to appreciate this film for what it is. A great story was created, and the premise and execution was raw and emotional, giving the film a little extra kick. Many directors have tried to make similar films to this one in the years that have passed, and none of them have been nearly succesful. This film taps into the fears we all have as children, and mixes it with an urban legend in unpredictable fashion.To this day, this is one of my favorite films, because it is unlike anything I've ever seen. And for those who have criticized the acting, they should note that the scene with Heather when she is saying goodbye into the camera and breaks down in tears, is not only well acted, but one of the most convincing performances by a female lead in a horror film.	5.0	A Great Faux-Documentary	2011-07-18	2	2	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2O7XXGIOYVR8R	cousinpaco	"I'll admit it: I'm a grown man, and ""the Blair Witch Project"" creeped me out.For days.Three acquaintences set out into the woods of rural Maryland to film a documentary about a local legend. Losing their way, they are forced to spend a few nights in the woods. The film from their cameras is the only thing police ever find of the trio.Most of the complaints I've heard about this movie focus on the amateurish camera-work--and I can't argue. The frame bounces and jiggles more than my high-school government video. However, since the characters featured in the film are supposed to be using hand-held video cameras to document their search for the fabled Blair Witch, it's a brilliant way to blur the line between their reality and ours. Take a Dramamine before watching, and you'll be fine.Besides, the creepiest stuff isn't what you SEE, it's what you HEAR. Sound is a vital component of this film, so be warned--you'll need more than standard television speakers to truly get the full effect.How scared you are by ""the Blair Witch Project"" depends on how afraid of camp-outs when you were a kid. It's the same kind of creeped out feeling you'd have if you took a picture of your buddies at a campfire, and the developed photo showed someone in the woods watching you.If you're like me, you'll want to buy a nite-lite after watching this one."	5.0	cousinpaco's top terror: #4	2002-10-08	4	3	1

I agree whole heartedly with another reviewer that most of the harsh opinions of the movie come from jaded viewers once they found out that it was fake & I also agree on how creepy that in itself truly is. To me though ""The Blair Witch Project"" is the most sucsessful morbid joke to be played on the morbid human psyche of a generation of movie goers eyeballs deep in endless questions of mortal uncertainty,war,religion,serial killers,computers & cell phones & naturally created by a few young morbid filmmakers from that very same generation. Horror movies have always been twisted reflections of real life horror(politically,socially ect) I mean look at the resurgence & demand for horror films since 9/11 compared to the lack of good horror films in the 1990's,I promise folks that's not a coincidence. I will never forget the eerie & down right chilling buzz that this movie had floating around it right before it came out aswell as while I was waiting inline among the first million to see it.In my opinion this film is a wrongfully disrespected gem that deserves a place up top the pedistol along side the greatest & most important american horror films such as Psycho,Texas Chainsaw Massacre,The Exorcist,Halloween,Alien ect. If your not a fully conditioned android yet & you still know how to suspend disbelief & you still watch scary movies for the fright factor,then aside from a handful of it's elder's as well as a few recent masterpieces you can't do much better than ""The Blair Witch Project""."	5.0	A Mistreated & Shamefully Disrespected Masterpiece !	2006-10-14	15	8	7

The suspense in this movie exhausted me and the ending is something my friends and I still  discuss. The movie is not your usual film, no blood, no guts and no creepy  mosters or people for you to focus on. The fear is all in your own head.  There has been too much fo the slasher horror films for some to fully  understand or enjoy this film. They are too used to the fear being  visualized for them instead if letting their own imagination take them  there. This movie is an excellent self induced fear-fest and if you are not  the kind of person to let go and let your subconcious scare you then you  will not like this film.

A nice good honest scare if you let yourself get into it a little and stop being so cynical.  Put yourself in the actor's shoes (are they actors?) and just enjoy the ride.  Nobody will fault you for it.  The media hype and advertising for this was brilliant back in the day.  They had us all hoping it was a real ""Project"" but also scared if it really was.  Something I find funny is how people here keep giving this movie bad reviews and a hard time.  People, you're taking things way too seriously and missing a great opportunity to have some fun!  Those of you who can remember back far enough to when this thing first came out, can you also remember asking yourself after you saw it, ""Was that real?""  Most of us said, ""No way"" (like my wife).  But there was always that little tickle in the back of my mind saying, ""What if it is?""  Especially since I now live about 30 minutes from the place it supposedly happened.  Am I dumb or naive for that?  I don't think so.  It's a bit like Fox Mulder's poster in the X-Files - ""I want to believe"".  The marketing and hype back in the day was great and truly set an early benchmark where we started seeing movies that wanted us to think they were real documentaries.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	"The Blair Witch Project is the most brilliantly creepy movie I have ever seen.  I can no longer say just how many times I've watched this film, but I become more and more impressed with its production with each viewing.  I can't really imagine how so many people can claim that this film didn't scare them in the least.  I am a long-time horror fan, inured long ago to almost everything the movie studios throw out there on the big screens with a ""frightening"" label.  The Blair Witch Project, I am delighted to say, creeped me out quite impressively.  It may well be that this is a different movie experience depending on the venue of its audience.  Those watching the film for the first time at home can turn off all their lights and watch the movie in the dark, but there is really no way to recreate or equal the powerful mood and atmosphere that came rushing in icy waves on to a theatre audience.  When I go to see horror movies, there is almost always some laughter to be heard from time to time, and usually I am the one doing the laughing.  Once Heather, Michael, and Josh got into the Maryland woods and the spooky meter began to rise, an eerie, almost unprecedented silence took over those of us sitting in the theatre.  There was no laughter; I heard no one sucking on a straw or chomping on popcorn; no adolescents whispered back and forth.  There was no longer an audience around me; I and the film were locked together in a mortal embrace, and as the suspense built up at the end I felt as if some force were pushing me farther and farther back into my seat.  When the movie ended, I don't remember anyone really talking about what they had just seen; I think we all just wanted to get the heck out of that darkened theatre.  That kind of experience, I must say, is what my horror dreams are made of.  Viewing the film at home just cannot recreate the movie experience.To me, The Blair Witch Project is simply brilliant in many, many ways.  First, of course, Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick used the Internet to build up a hype of unprecedented proportions for this film many months before its general release, creating a thriving fan base drawn deeply into the legend of the Blair Witch and the mysteriously doomed student film project, mucking up the waters of truth and fiction into a bloody froth that attracted horror sharks such as myself from far and wide.  Then there was the SciFi Channel documentary Curse of the Blair Witch that was released just prior to the film's release.  In this remarkably professional and believable documentary, the fictional story of the movie was given sturdy legs with which to scurry around the truth.  The actors used in the documentary were amazingly good, and the use of family photos, old historical documents and letters, newspaper articles, television news features, interviews with law enforcement, family and friends, etc., did a great job of masquerading fiction as reality.  Even those of us who knew going into the theatre that this was a work of pure fiction could allow ourselves to wonder if the story could still actually be true, and that suspension of disbelief did much to increase the power of what I saw on the big screen.Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams were simply brilliant.  Their displays of fright, rage, and hopelessness were stunningly believable; of course, some credit for the actors' performances must also go to the geniuses behind the film.  I would imagine that the dark woods would become quite unnerving after a few nights, even when you know that whoever or whatever is out there is just someone associated with the film production, and the fact that the characters were forced to endure sleep-deprived nights and grueling daytime hikes over the course of a full week had to do wear down the defenses of the actors and bring to the surface emotions and expressions that lie too deeply to be accessed simply on command.  I am still fascinated to read about the way in which things were managed in the filming.  The actors ad libbed almost everything they said and did, which is actually quite amazing.  At times, though, they had to redo things in order to please the filmmakers; the best example of this comes in the movie's final scene.  As I understand it, the scene in the movie is actually a second night's shoot of those events, as things did not go quite the way the filmmakers wanted on the first night.  To see that kind of emotion and fear portrayed by an exhausted Michael and Heather on a second night's take is just outstanding.This horror fan welcomed such a refreshingly new type of movie to the fold.  I like blood and gore as much as anyone, but true fright is best achieved by unspectacular yet highly personal events taking place in what looks very much like the real world as we know it.  Millions of dollars have never made an expensive, special effects-laden horror movie as creepy as this extremely low-budget masterpiece of mood, atmosphere, and unseen things that go bump in the night."	5.0	Absolutely brilliant and genuinely frightening	2003-08-02	27	22	5

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ	"Daniel S. ""Daniel"""	THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT deserves, in my opinion, the perfect 5 for several  reasons. First of all, it's a movie with an original screenplay full of  ideas, very well conceived and a lot more professionnal than what we have  to digest all year long. Secondly, I know that it's extremely difficult to  shoot a movie which must follow as a pattern a documentary filmed by  semiprofessionnal people. Thirdly, I was really impressed by the actors  involved in the project and I never had the impression to watch a  fiction.But, principally, I'm glad that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT reminds  us one or two truths about cinema and movies. One cannot judge a movie by  saying that the action is not plausible, that, in the case of THE BLAIR  WITCH PROJECT, the characters are not reacting in a normal manner, that  they should have followed the river downward, etc. If you want to see real  things, open your eyes and go get lost into the woods yourselves. Then, you  will encounter real things.Cinema is not about REALITY. Cinema is a  filter letting the IDEAS of a director or a producer become moving images.  The most important scene of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is the scene presenting  Josh while filming Heather and discovering that the camera changes reality  and acts as a filter. The camera is reassuring. At this moment, one can  hear the directors of the movie murmuring to our ears : what you are  watching is not reality , it's only OUR reality translated into images so  don't judge it by your standards of reality but by the impression THE BLAIR  WITCH PROJECT will make on your mind.I'm aware that my interpretation is  not particularly &quot;in&quot; in 2000, a cinematographic period  presenting very graphic movies, the more the movie is surgically precise,  the more the average moviegoer is happy. But what I'm sure of is that the  best directors of Movie History are certainly not Michal Bay, Steven  Spielberg or Wes Craven but rather Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, Orson Welles  or Werner Herzog, directors who tried to translate their dreams into  images.A DVD for my library.

Reilly	"Everybody knows the story of The Blair Witch Project: 3 student filmmakers go missing after heading into the woods to make a documentary about a local legend. I saw the movie a few times when it was originally released theatrically, and was blown away by it. I bought the DVD to see if it still held up, especially after the disastrous Book of Shadows debacle...I'm happy to say that, while I don't necessarily think it's a watershed of filmmaking, Blair Witch holds up as a great horror movie, something horror fans get precious little of. The constant bickering of the characters seems more noticable now that the newness is gone, and the acting doesn't seem quite as good. Also, as I've expanded my horror horizons, Blair witch doesn't seem quite so original, either. (See Ruggerio Deodato's late '70's jungle epic ""Cannibal Holocaust"" for a more gore-oriented spin on the same concept of vanished filmmakers, and ""The Last Broadcast"", which preceeded Blair Witch by a few years, and seems like another unacknowledged inspiration, and also has a more satisfying ending.) Blair Witch has lost none of it's creepiness, or it's power to disturb. For my money, the last shot is one of the creepiest in cinema history.The DVD comes with some nice extras, including the 45-minute ""Curse of the Blair Witch"", originally shown on the Sci-Fi channel, which is incredibly informative and well done; ""Newly-discovered footage""- A forgettable 5-minute scene; A timeline of Blair Witch sightings and events, Director Commentary, and a fairly easy-to-find Easter Egg: Highlight the stick man on the extras screen, and you'll be able to access trailers, TV spots, and a trailer for ""The Stand"".Overall, a great DVD.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3K3DEVYIOWX0Y	Daniel Zuccarelli	I know alot of people hated this movie. And I understand why. You see, this is not a mainstream movie. When it got all the press and started making tons of money I knew the backlash would come, because people that  shouldn't see the movie were going out to watch it. The public is used to  neat little movies wrapped up in cute little packages, and this movie  doesn't do that. It's raw, shaky, ad-libbed, not very cohesive, but it  works. You need to suspend disbelief and just put yourself in that  situation, what would you do? We slowly but surely watch these people  unravel as the movie goes on, talking less, getting tired, hungry, scared.  You can see it on their faces, and it's horrifying to watch. I have seen  alot of horror movies in my time, but this was the first one that made me  actually made me lose sleep. The day after I saw it, I was telling a friend  about it and got goosebumps just by thinking about the ending. The DVD  rocks because it has the best director commentary I've heard yet. These  guys were so down to earth and give you tons of great trivia about what was  going on during the shoot. And there's the Sci-Fi special making the blair  witch seem all the more real.  I only have one complaint, what's with the  border around the picture? It makes the movie look fake, a full screen, no  border shot would've given the movie the home video feel that it needed at  home, watch the extra scene on the dvd, it's full screen, you'll see what I  mean.

Practically every horror movie I've seen scared me. Not this one though. This movie was FUNNY. It was so stupid, it's an hour and a half of listening to Heather scream. They walk in the woods, they walk in the woods some more, they walk in the woods for a little more, then they blow up at each other, then they walk in the woods some more, and then the movie's over. I cleaned the dvd and watched the last scene again to make sure it hadn't skipped to the end or something! This movie does not belong on vhs or dvd, it belongs in the america's funniest home videos archive. It was not scary, not a single part was surprising. You usually watch horror movies in hopes that you will be SCARED and SUPRISED not BORED and SLEEPY. I probably wouldn't have been able to tell it someone put it on pause while I was watching it. The trailer for I know what you did last summer was scarier. And we all know trailers aren't scary. This movie was easily the most hilarious movie I've ever seen.

I was aware of its hype when I saw it. I can't say I was really scared, but I found it quite entertaining, especially the interviews in the beginning. The trio of filmmakers and the people they interviewed were very much like normal people, which gave this film an eerie feel of reality that made us care about them. I don't recommend seeing this on video, because it's so short some people might feel cheated. But I definitely recommend the DVD.

I'm sorry, but if you walked into a movie theater and had no clue in the world what this movie was about, you would  be scared out of your wits. It seems real enough, hence it would be real to  you. But, because of the hype surrounding it, people expected maybe... oh,  I dunno... aliens to send a 4-eyed witch to kill 3 kids who hold the  secrets to the wonders of the universe. Sorry, folks. You won't find that  here. What you will find is a creepy and well-thought out odyssey into  heart-pumping terror. As for the people who hate this film cause they  thought it was too &quot;cheap looking,&quot; just stop right now.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2SJU6MCH3HBEL	Danny	Pay the title of this review no mind; I am not a moron...Anyway, 99% of the world has heard of this surprise summer blockbuster. The other 1% live in caves up in the hills somewhere. For  those 1%, The Blair Witch Project is an independent film about three  filmmakers who go into the Black Hills Forest in Maryland to do a  documentary on the local legend, The Blair Witch. There, they lose the map,  their minds, and eventually, their lives. This is probably the scariest  film since the original Halloween. This was only an experimental  film. It was totally what i expected and then some. The actors are very  believable and kudos to Dan Myrnick and Eduardo Sanchez for their  involvement in pretty much everything this movie dishes out. Sure, it won't  win the Best Picture Award or anything, but it's impossible to deny that it  will soon become a classic (how many times have you seen Heather's  confession parodied on so many TV shows around the nation?), and will spawn  many clones. They're already making a sequel to it which kind of ruins its  originality and purpose. Bottom line: an enjoyable indie with some pretty  suspenseful moments and even more scares and chills. But according to some  of these people, you should rent it first before you even think about  buying it.	4.0	Da Blare Which Progekt!	2000-01-20	7	5	2

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2ZUFNYOHSW7NG	Darius Thomson	I was thrilled by the promotions for this film.  Big props for the admen.I thought the &quot;Curse of the Blair Witch&quot; documentary was great, and I'm glad they included it in its entirety here on the DVD... but  after seeing the film the second and third time, I have repeatedly come to  the conclusion that this movie was mediocre at best.The movie had its  moments.  Near the end with Heather confessing into the camera Realworld  style, that was good.  The interviews with the &quot;locals;&quot; very  good... but too much of the movie was wasted on juvenile displays of  overwrought method acting, and phony relational breakdowns between the  characters.  The ending was good in concept, and the only truly frightening  portion of the movie, but it was SO anticlimactic- given the fact that it  was so SHORT...  Horror is all about the mind.  The audience wasn't given  enough opportunity to construct a very frightening image of the Witch,  unless they were Really paying attention to the website, and watching the  &quot;Curse of the Blair Witch on TV.&quot;My call:  Blair Witch Project  ** Curse of the Blair Witch ****	2.0	Great concept, mediocre execution.	1999-10-22	0	0	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2HII4U9WQ0XUV	"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep"""	"Isn't it amazing how some of the most skin-crawlingly terrifying tales in the English language start out like this:""There once was an Old Woman who lived in a house by the Woods...""You probably read a little tale like that, or ten of `em, most likely when you were back in the 2nd grade.Spooked the bewhiskers out of you, didn't it? Because the little Old Woman goes hunting for a soupbone, only she doesn't go to the local Super Target, nosirree: she heads down the windy lane through the darksome woods and does a little spelunking in the ancient cemetery.You know, for her soup bone. To make her nightly chow.And that would be that, except it turns out that something nasty comes calling in the wee hours of the night, looking for its bone.With that tucked into our cape, let's consider ""The Blair Witch Project"", a stripped-down, bare-bones excursion into the grisly, nasty, unforgiving horror that lurks in the deepest, darkest thickets way out at the back of beyond.Turns out there was once an Old Woman named Elly Kedward, who lived in a hovel on the verge of the Woods. Only this particular Old Woman did far worse than finagle a few finger bones from the local boneyard for her noontime chow: she invited the little neighbor kids into the hovel because---well, they say, because she wanted their blood.Being that it was the Year of our Lord 1785, and the folks in nearby Blair, Maryland were of a distinctly different moral fiber from their latter-day descendants: more Doctor Cotton Mather, very little Dr. Phil---well, they banished Poor Old Elly from town, strapped into a cart, hauled off into her Woods, and left to die of exposure.Maybe they should have picked someplace other than the Woods, because evidently Goody Kedward was a big believer in not going softly into that good night. First something awful---a curse, rippling up out of the thickets---took away all the children of Blair, erasing the town entirely.In 1825, a search party out of Burkitsville---founded on the old site of Blair---canvas the woods in vain for a hapless little girl reputedly pulled into a creek close to the final dying place of the old Witch: they never find her, and for weeks thereafter the creek runs with tarry, oily bundles of sticks.Then in 1886, another search party goes looking for a missing boy, and never returns: they are later found bound in a pentagram on Coffin Rock, disembowelled.There's more, of course: always involving missing children, and madness, and bundles of sticks and twigs and stones, and those haunting, desolate Woods.Which is part of the attraction to the three student filmmakers---Heather, Mike, and Josh---who, in 1994, arrive with gear and questions to the modern-day hamlet of Burkitsville. It's like something out of an Edward Gorey tale, really: they depart from town for the Woods, and they enter the forests of the Black Hills.And they never come out.Now: ""Blair Witch"" purports to be nothing less than the unedited footage of the three missing students, found buried in the detritus beneath a colonial house undisturbed for a century. It is shot both in high-end digital video and, occasionally, 16MM,intended for the serious footage of the student film.What emerges is a deep and dark excursion from the levity of a weekend jaunt into the woods, into extreme terror. The most delicious thing about ""Blair Witch is the immediacy of the horror: Dan Myrick & Eduardo Sanchez may have felt the heavy hand of a micro-budget in keeping the filming lean, mean, and joined at the hip with the young protagonists, but the result is electric: you are a fellow passenger on a journey into the Strange and the Doomed: it's like looking over the shoulder of the Titanic's captain on the fatal day.The brilliance of ""Blair Witch"" is its primal simplicity: it offers an excursion into the woody territory of the King of the Horrors, old when Man's first progenitor hauled itself up from the waters: the Fear of the Unknown.Anyone who has hunted in the high mountains, or gone for a walk in some rustic forest, knows that Fear well: can attest to the point at which the Woods became dark, the atmosphere positively seethed with menace---when it became evident that the intruder was not only not welcome, but hated.The juicy, nasty gristle of ""Blair Witch"" is that crawling, ovewhelming sensation of having been moved from reporter to victim: being stalked, deep in the Woods, by something hungry, and Evil, and cold, and totally insane.Lovely? Not always. Dark and Deep? Forever.JSG"	5.0	The Woods are Lovely, dark and Deep	2005-12-18	8	6	2

As they set up camp in the woods of Maryland they soon find themselves lost but they're not alone.  It seems the Blairwitch isn't just a myth....it is reality.  Excellent performances from debut actors who actually have the same names - Heather Donaghue and Michael Williams to name but a few.  The crying and the noises (although we don't see the Blairwitch herself) is more than enough to chill anybody's nerve.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A14SO48SN83R3U	Darren	Great Marketing appears to have drawn the crowd to see this one. Blair Witch offers a creative cinematic perspective however this movie gets lost in a most boring sequence of camping events and one highly annoying female character. The acting is horrible and the plot nothing more than overreactive hysteria to a bunch of freaky nonsense and mind games. The ending is somewhat scary without alot of special effects..but not nearly as scary as it's hyped out to be. I have seen some very creative and scary films without the violence and splatter ... unfortunately, Blair Witch is not one of them.	1.0	Someone should drop a house on this witch	2000-09-30	18	12	6

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A34JAXR0W215IP	Das Book	"(NOTE: I first wrote this review in 2000, then rewrote it in 2007.)As others have noted, there's not much middle ground on this movie: you either like it or you hate it. And I'll be honest, there are good arguments to be made both ways.One of the most common complaints is that there's a lot of arguing; and make no mistake, that's absolutely true. Almost as soon as the trio sets foot in the woods, in fact, they're already bickering at each other, and it only gets worse as the movie progresses. Others complain that the Blair Witch--only the namesake of the bloody movie, after all--never actually appears on screen, and it's left up to the viewer to decide what really happens at the end. The mythology is fairly inscrutable, as well; it's never really explained in the film what those mysterious ""stick-men"" are supposed to represent, and the contents of the bundle of sticks that Heather discovers near the end are so blurred that they could be almost anything. (For the record, according to the feature-length commentary, they're human teeth. Because Heather's holding the camera so close to them, they appear larger than they really are, which has led to some fairly colorful speculations among fans.)But really, all of that adds to the beauty of the whole project. Any psychologist can tell you that fear, especially mortal fear, can manifest itself in countless ways, one of which is to lash out at the people around you; who among us can say that we'd behave any differently? I'll grant that it's stretching credibility that Mike would so callously throw away their only map and then admit to it as gleefully as he does, but otherwise, the trio's behavior is surprisingly accurate. And yes, the ending is ambiguous; but then again, so is the ending of ""2001,"" which is widely hailed as one of the finest films, science fiction or otherwise, ever made. Sometimes the best endings are the ones that aren't spoon-fed to us.But to truly appreciate what a work of genius this film is, it helps to remember the context in which it was released. This film was one of the first serious attempts by a filmmaker (or team of them, in this movie's case) to create a universe outside of the movie proper, a practice that's common today in the form of the alternate reality game. The Web site, although fairly sparse nowadays, was at the time instrumental in providing much of the film's backstory, particularly the history of the Blair Witch legend itself (it's worth mentioning, incidentally, that it's a testament to this movie's impact that the web site still exists at all); and the accompanying documentary, ""Curse of the Blair Witch""--which is included on the DVD--used professional actors in its cast, but was filmed in an extemporanous manner that made it utterly indistinguishable from a legitimate documentary. So successful were the filmmakers, in fact, that the legend of the Blair Witch is still occasionally taken as fact even today, eight years after the movie was first released. And they did it all on a budget of only $40,000; in Hollywood, that kind of money is treated like bus fare.  I will concede that, since the movie relies so heavily on supplementary materials like the web site and documentary, it remains to be seen if it still has the same impact in twenty years that it did eight years ago.  A truly great movie should be timeless, or as close to it as possible, which may well prove to be this movie's fatal flaw.As for the argument that we never see the witch, all I can say is that sometimes it's what your subconscious percieves that makes something scary, not what your eyes tell you. After all, your subconscious knows exactly what keeps you awake at night. If you've got an open mind and some time to kill, watch ""The Blair Witch Project."" Just don't do what I did and watch it right before bed.(The DVD itself is full of extras, as many early DVDs were; there's the aforementioned feature-length commentary, plus the ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" documentary, along with the obligatory collection of trailers. This was quite stunning for those of us who grew up on VHS and hadn't been exposed to the sorts of features that Laserdisc users had been enjoying for years!)"	5.0	It's hard to be ambivalent about this one!	2000-02-22	0	0	0

It's almost like when you scare the hell out of that kid when you are in 6th grade, and he might have been screaming wide-eyed with fright, only to tell you a couple minutes later ""Hey, You Didn't Scare Me"", just to repair his pride or ego. When I first saw ""Blair Witch"", it did scare me, and left me a little rattled at the end.....why? Because when I went to see it in the theater, there was still a strong buzz about the movie that it was either really an aborted documentary, or was a film based on true events...we were supposedly seeing the genuine article. Sure, I may have been duped by a clever marketing campaign that involved TV mocumentaries, internet gossip and radio buzz.....and looking back I think that was great. ""Blair Witch"" if nothing else, is a wonderful homage to William Castle, who back in the day of ""The Tingler"" would wire theater seats to shock select members of the audience to induce a well timed scream, or his film ""The House on Haunted Hill"", where skeletons would buzz the audience, or his movie ""Straight Jacket"" in which he offered the audience a chance to buy life insurance in case the film scared them to death. That is great stuff that put butts in the theater seats, and with the advances in technology, and modern communication, ""Blair Witch"" and it's marketing campaign did the same thing, only the updated version. It worked, the movie made a ton of dough and was the water-cooler talk around theoffice for weeks. Did I feel let down when I learned ""Blair Witch"" was just a movie? No. I applauded the idea behind the movie, and only wish more films would do the same. As far as the actual movie goes when I watch it on dvd....well it doesn't pack the same punch as when you might think these were actual events, but I still get a kick out of it. And it's obvious this film hit's a nerve with quite a few people, I mean at this time there are over 1700 reviews posted here at Amazon about this movie...most are ripping the film apart....but there just seems to be a hint of that 6th grader saying ""Yeah....you didn't scare me"" as they rush over to turn on the lights after the movie ends."	4.0	Give Credit Where Credit's Due	2005-03-29	198	171	27
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A36L1F0YECOAW8	David Grant	Taking us back to the days of 'The Uninvited'(1944) and 'The  Haunting'(1963), The Blair Witch Project is all about the unseen. We are  never told directly what the characters in the film are seeing. We are  never given a glimpse of the horror persuing them in the woods. Directors  Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez take the best approach to this type of  story, leaving the horror in the minds of it's viewers. The imagination is  so much more powerful than CGI or special make-up effects that a couple of  college kids screaming at something off-camera could keep you up for days  and days without sleep. As we all know, it isn't being alone in the dark  that frightens us as children... it's of NOT being alone in the dark. The  thoughts of what might be under our beds... or watching us from outside our  darkened windows... that's what scares us. That's what makes The Blair  Witch Project unique. It doesn't tell us to be scared of anything. It  allows us to project our own fears into it. That would also explain why  it's one of those 'love it / hate it' movies. Some people need something to  scream at. They lack imagination. Other people don't. The latter will get  the most out of this picture. The phenomenal acting (most of which was  ad-libbed) and dreary locales are major pluses. But it's the little  things... the bumps and scratches... the shadows... the sound of dead  leaves cracking in the darkness... That's what makes this film so powerful.  It will stay with you for days, months, even years. Brace yourself. You're  not getting out of this one untouched. You will be terrified.	5.0	A classic approach to 90's horror.	2000-08-07	8	4	4

However, the illusion was so well done that until things started getting  really nasty for Heather, Josh, and Mike, this film made me feel the way  everyone feels about that friend or relative who insists on dragging out  his home movies/videos every time you go to visit him -- that maybe you  don't want to go visit him after all.	3.0	Realistic -- to a fault	2000-01-04	1	1	0

You need to see the witch?  You're telling me if you go home and see your house trashed, you won't get  scared until you see the criminal?  I don't think so.  If you see the  criminal, you have some control as to where to go or what to do.  But not  knowing where the culprit is, it's anybody's guess.  This is how &quot;The  Blair Witch Project&quot; movie was strong, because you don't see the  witch.  Another great aspect is the realism of the film.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A39L5T2ZQZ52FN	David Michael Cohen	I give this film 2 stars because it has one great idea.  Unfortunately, it lost a lot in the execution.  For one thing, real documentarians do not film every petty disagreement, and watching argument after argument gets a little tedious.  Second, the characters are not sympathetic in the least.  They act stupidly (one throws away their map?  Why?  Good question) and do little besides swear at each other.  Some scenes, such as the much imitated &quot;God I'm so scared&quot; scene could have been effective  if we had been able to develop any sympathy for the characters. Finally, although being lost in the woods is a frightening situation, we are supposed the believe they are really afraid of some gothic horror menace.  Said horror is kept off screen, and when done well this can be very effective.  In this movie, it is done poorly, and thus it looks silly.  We have the characters freaking out over a pile of rocks and a tree with stick figures hanging on it.  I mean, come on, STICK FIGURES!  I can only attribute this movie's success to America's starvation for innovative entertainment.  This starvation has led the American public to eat dirt and call it classic cuisine.	2.0	What's so great about it?	2001-06-11	11	7	4

I accept that this is supposed to be their documentary footage but its hardly award  winning stuff.The film did not maintain the interest of the audience,  infact, I've never seen so many people walk out of a film.  The times that  they build the tension they lost it to long stretches of nothing but  Heather and Mike arguing.A very clever idea but not tight enough to  scare the majority of people.  I do however, identify well with the feeling  of being lost while tramping/hiking.	1.0	the footage should have stayed lost - or been cut a bit more	1999-11-04	0	0	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1FDW1SPYKB354	David Von Pein	"If some of the scenes in this landmark film didn't scare the heck out of you....then you're incapable of being scared! This is truly one of the most frightening motion pictures I've ever watched.We never see a witch, or a wild-eyed maniac with a chainsaw, or any ghost-like figures. These images that we never see, but THINK we might run into at any moment, are precisely what make this film so effectively chilling.The viewer begins to put himself into the shoes of the characters....and we begin to wonder, just like the frightened people in the movie -- What the heck is making those strange noises!? We never see what it is, and neither do the characters. But we do get some exceptionally eerie clues along the way. Clues that only increase our anxiety.So hang onto something and experience ""The Blair Witch Project""!  It's a highly memorable movie experience."	5.0	If Any Film Can Truly Scare You....This Is The One!	2001-09-09	2	1	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1MC6BFHWY6WC3	D. Blankenship	"This was and is, for me, a most fascinating film on several levels; the film itself being only one of the interesting points.  Take a close look at the reviews that have been posted here on Amazon...look at them closely.  We are quickly approaching a total of 2,000 reviews and if you check the spread you will instantly see that people are quite divided.  It is almost an even split between those who love this film and praise it in many ways, and on the other end, those who absolutely despise everything about this work.  I like that...just goes to illustrate the wonderful diversity in taste we humans are blessed with.  What if we all liked the same thing?  Boooring!If you bother to read through these almost 2,000 reviews, dating back to 1999, you will note that this difference in opinion has generated a number of ""flame wars"" amongst our reviewers here.  Whoa, talk about striking an emotional chord for a lot of movie viewers and buffs.  There simply are not that many films that seem to polarize like this film.  And again, personally I think that is a good thing.I first watched this film shortly after its release and I must confess to you that at that time I was on the side of those who were not overly impressed.  I remember my first reaction was ""What the.....""  Since that time I have watched this film five or six times, with the last viewing being last night.  I have changed my mind.  The reason for this number of viewings is not that I was all that enamored with the movie, but rather that I keep very late hours...very, very late, (Insomnia you know) and do a tremendous amount of channel surfing in the wee hours of the morning.  And that is where you will find this movie residing now...lost in the jumble of late night T.V.  I have to tell you that over the years this one has grown on me.The movie of course as we all know by now, broke some new ground, both in filming technique, and in marketing.  The story is simple.  Three young college kids head out into the spooky woods intent on making a documentary film concerning the Blair Witch.  The filming is done by hand held cameras.  There is little to no script and the entire movie looks as if it were indeed filmed by three college students with hand held cameras.  The students become lost, scared, hungry, cold and bewildered.  Strange things begin to happen. Emotionally the students begin fighting, bickering and the personal stress level of each increases. Why?  There are no special effects in this movie, little or no blood and gore and as with the lost students; the viewer is required to let his or her imagination take over with only slight guidance from the film.  If all goes well, this can be a terrifying movie.  If all does not go well...it can be a complete waste.Indulge me for a moment and let me explain why I seem to be able to identify with this particular movie.Years ago, over fifty of them to be precise, my then girlfriend, who eventually became my wife and still is, took a day trip deep into the Boston Mountains of Northern Arkansas.  I was very much into black and white photography at the time and we had heard rumors of an old house place in the middle of no-where and I wanted to photograph it.(I have a thing for old buildings, barns, houses, etc.  After much research and question asking, we had a pretty good idea where this old place was located.  After a very long drive, over extremely bad roads which at the end included wheel ruts down through the woods, we found the head of the path that supposedly led to this place.Leaving the car in the middle of the woods we took our rather primitive backpacks (Army surplus) and about a ton of photography gear, a couple of cheese sandwiches, a small amount of water, and headed out.  It took us over three hours going over very rough and difficult terrain (It was in August and extremely hot), much more rugged than that which was depicted in the movie, but we finally located the old house.  It was in the absolute middle of nowhere.  There where no roads, very primitive and old paths, and was located about 50 yards from an ancient creek bed. The house was most certainly well over 100 years old.Now his was long, long before this movie was produced, but this old home, while smaller, bore an eerie resemblance to the Blair Witch home which we would see in the future.  Of course we did not know that then.  Anyway, we went about the business of setting up to photograph the place, inside and out. I made f few obligatory passes at my friend but we were so hot and dirty by that time, the moves were more or less half-hearted on my part and nil on hers.I am not what you would call a strong believer in the supernatural...at best I am a skeptic; at worse, I admit that there are things beyond what I can explain.  But let me tell you that we both, my future wife and I, were extremely ill at ease...right from the get go.  There was something about that old house that was just ""wrong.""  This feeling built and built over the next couple of hours or so to the point where we suddenly and spontaneously decided to get as far away from the place as we could.  Oh my.Neither my girl friend nor I were or are unfamiliar with wilderness area.  We both did and do pretty much know what we are doing.  But let me tell you that within 30 min. we were completely lost!  I do not know how it happened, but lost we were...and it got worse; it got to the point of almost absolute panic.  The longer we struggled to find our way out, the more, and I do not exaggerate here, the more terrified we became.  We were absolutely convinced that ""something"" was watching us and ""something"" was following us.  I know that this was more than likely a product of young and over active imaginations; I know that now, but let me tell you that it was very real at that time.It was very much after dark when we finally found our car which was a matter of absolute pure luck.(Brilliant me did not bother to pack any sort of flashlight...something that was strongly pointed out to me at the time).  We did not scream or curse at each other during this ordeal like the three in the movie did, but I can tell you that there were plenty of sharp and sarcastic exchanges, particularly on my friend's part, during those hours.And the story did not end there!  I shot a total of 16 rolls of film during that shoot; they were good shots....I think.  When I developed the film, every roll, and I mean every roll was completely black!  I am pretty good with a camera, both artistically and technically...was then; am now.  I don't make mistakes like that and never have.  I will be very honest with you though, after all these years we have never, never, never been even the slightest bit tempted to go back and reshoot.Anyway, I know how those three would have felt had the story been true.I think that for the viewer to appreciate this movie they need to let their imaginations loose and just go with the flow and try to get into the spirit of the film.When all is said and done, the marketing of this film was a stroke of brilliance.  It cost around $40,000. to shoot and has made millions over the years and is still making money.  After reading these reviews it is still apparently entertaining a lot of people and a lot of people still think it is a horrid movie.  Again, this is good...I like the controversy. Ignore the hype...watch it and make up your own mind...more or less ignore all of these reviews; the good, the bad and the ugly.As I said, ignore the star rating on this review...it is almost meaningless.  I have read the negative reviews and the positive reviews and for the most part agree with them all...on some level. I will say though, that if you have not watched this film you should do so, if for no other reason than to find out what all the hoopla is about.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"	5.0	IGNORE THE STAR RATING HERE...IN THE CASE OF THIS FILM IT IS MEANINGLESS.	2011-07-24	57	51	6
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2QLK69ZFXBZUC	D. Carmody	This movie intentionally had absolutely horrible dialogue.  It was probably an experimental film.  The experiment either failed or succeeded depending on what the guidelines were.  If the guidelines were to create  much buzz and make millions upon millions of dollars then it was a success.  If the guidelines were to make an entertaining/scary movie experience then  they failed miserably.  This movie is the worst movie that I have ever  seen.  Not once was I frightened.  I was angry that I spent the 85 minutes  watching it.  The only good thing about this movie is that it is extremly  short.	1.0	Worst Movie Ever	2000-07-23	7	3	4

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2GLFKM6IBYRP7	Dean Sullivan	Wow, what a great idea! Ok, maybe its not exactly a film, but what is a film. To me as long as you enjoy it, and its about 90 minutes its sort of a movie. This film, was scary, but not in the same sense as classic horrors  like John Carpenter's Halloween (a classic), or the modern teen horror  flicks like Scream. This movie plays more with your mind, you don't see the  witch (is there a witch?), you don't see anyone die (do they get  killed,  or kill themselves?), all you see is what your mind wants you to see. This  is even more of a classic when you take into account the small budget it  cost, and the amount it took at the box office. The DVD has loads of  extras, including extra footage, and a documentory intitled 'The curse of  the Blair Witch'. A fiine film, which is very different.	4.0	A new breed of horror	2000-04-26	4	2	2

Blair Witch stuck with him for several days.  At the time, there was a hot debate as to whether Blair  Witch was a true story or a bunch of hype.  That might've been what tripped  me up.This movie was made creepy because those poor kids couldn't see their  nemesis.  But.  They heard things.  Saw the strange symbols surrounding  their tent the next morning.  Then the first victim had his gear stolen  shortly before he disappeared.This isn't a horror movie, but an extreme  psychological thriller.  The beginning is somewhat interesting, if not a  little boring.  The middle is good.  The ending will disturb you.  Enjoy.	5.0	A Creative Spinoff From the Typical	2000-07-14	3	1	2

I believe this film stands as one of the highest grossing movies in the last 20 years, but definitely crumbles in the wake of its effective hype.Anyone who's anyone knows the story. Three college students vanish into the Maryland woods while filming a documentary about a witch to prove or discredit the myth surrounding it. Their footage is uncovered. This is what you see...Marshmellows...documentary-style interviews...joking around...restlessness...anger...endless tirades about the missing map...a stick figure dangling from a tree...a  Gilligan's Island joke around a campfire...running...screaming...snot oozing from the nostrils of one of the main characters as she trembles and mutters her apologies...more running and screaming...THE END.I usually don't prefer to spoil essential plot elements or twists, but the problem with ""TBWP"" is that it doesn't have any. The sequel it eventually spawned is truly ten steps backward and worse than its predecessor, so I suppose you would have to cut this one a decent amount of slack, but despite the fact that it has little to no meat on its bones, the film is shot very well. It's a shame because Myrick and Sanchez could've utilized that potential with more oomph and given us some real scares instead of needless bickering about the map.I suggest you rent it first before buying it. I made the mistake of buying it on my first viewing and shook my head with disappointment. To sum it all up, this is one of those Saturday night get together flicks where the best hype is discredited by its product, but you might enjoy it as a rental and a rental alone."	3.0	"""I'm...so scared...""  *drip drip*"	2005-05-02	10	4	6

It would have been presumptuous of me to dismiss this as an over-hyped movie  with 75 minutes of typical whiney Gen-X indie film navel-gazing and 10  minutes of truly horrific suspense without even screening it first, but  that would be cheating. So now that I've watched it, I can tell you with  confidence that its basically an over-hyped movie with 75 minutes of  typical whiney Gen-X indie film navel-gazing with about 10 minutes of truly  horrific suspense. But those 10 minutes contain some of the most truly  unnerving moments in horror filmdom. The &quot;trick&quot; here is that the  viewer's &quot;scare&quot; factor depends on whatever personal baggage they  bring with them--a device that has served directors like Roman Polanski  very well in the past.	3.0	The &quot;We're RICH!&quot; Project	2000-07-21	3	2	1

The theatre was packed because so much unnecessary hype surrounded the movie. Many people were stupid enough to believe it was real story. Never underestimate the power of marketing. The theatre was packed and what we got for our seven dollars was two hours of twigs, stick figures made out of twigs, and some of the loudest screaming I've heard since watching a clip of a Backstreet Boys concert. Part of this movie are supposed to tense and scary, but I couldn't see what the hoopola was about. At nighttime, the characters hear some suspicious noise in the forest and they start getting scared.

I have to hand it to the people at Artisan films - they sure can create a buzz ! However they have fooled us all. This has to be the single most disappointing film experience of my life! Utter  unrelenting bilge! I fell asleep during the film, had to rewind my DVD, and  try again. I watched it alone, in a dark room, after midnight, and have  been more scared reading my bank statements. I gave it every chance, and it  was woeful! Why didn't these three pillocks carry a mobile phone and that  way we would all have been spared the waste of ninety minutes of our lives?  The only way this could scare anyone would be to watch the documentary  extra on the DVD-'The curse of the Blair Witch' and then try to convince  themselves it was true, remove a sizeable portion of their brain, suspend  thought, and then you might just be mildly nervous, and not comatose as I  was.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3FPBDKUZ55EG5	Dina_S	The Blair Witch Project is the kind of film that will not appeal to everyone. A very small budget (in comparison to the standard employed by Hollywood) was used to make this film and this is evident from the lack of special effects, the use of unknown actors to play the three main characters and the directorial style which could be described as simple but edgy, filmed in a bland black and white/sepia.The film is presented as an investigate documentary, the project of Heather, Josh and Mike, three college students out to investigate the infamous legend of the `Blair Witch'- a semi-mythical being who supposedly haunts the desolate Burkitsville (formerly Blair) woods. The story unravels through the eyes of this trio and the viewer is exposed to the primal fear and emotional desperation ...In my opinion, the film is made more, not less terrifying because of what the viewer doesn't see rather than what you do. Nothing is overt and you are forced to use your imagination, a concept rarely employed in modern cinema where the techniques of special effects and predictable storylines have drained viewers of their mental creativity. Those viewers who are used to getting their thrills on a plate will therefore dislike this film.The BWP could have been a disastrous and pretentious attempt at a new style of filmmaking. However, I believe it has attained a status and reaction that very few contemporary horror/thriller movies achieve by appealing to base instincts and emotions both of the actors and the viewers alike.	4.0	Simple effects produce the best thrills	2002-10-21	3	2	1

Even I can shoot  better with my HandyCam! What? That was their intention, to be shaky and  all? Then I like this &quot;movie&quot; even less! Anyway, the plot is very  loose, moves sooo slow, bores you to death (&quot;are we lost? maybe! no  we're not lost! oh yes we're lost!&quot;)! And what do the makers define as  scary?  I watched that in plain darkness, alone in my house, and I got  sleepy! Sure, some... thing is hunting them, they're finding strange...  piles of rocks and stuff, but that only scares them (we assume)!  There's  no frightening scene for the viewer!

While sequences during the night when  the sounds come out to play are supposed to be horrific, the running  through the woods and the violent shaking of the cameras make it an  unenjoyable moment. There's really nothing else to complain about, except  at times you wish they would just find the damn car and go home to eat  Mother's mashed potatoes. The one good aspect of the film is the way they  have managed to capture how one can go totally insane when lost in the  woods or in a large, uniform area. The performances from the three actors  in this area is definitely very superb, and manages to save the film from  total ruin. But overall, this is not worth all of the hype it received.  Good for one rent, but none thereafter.	2.0	The Do-It-Yourself-Disaster Project...	2000-04-26	2	2	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3ODVYRIERNB4O	D. Marvin	For those expecting a run-of-the-mill big budget horrorfest, look to the &quot;Scream&quot; series and stay away from the underground cult soon-to-be classic &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot;. What the BWP's  naysayers seem to think is that money was actually spent on this film and  that the actors were paid big bucks. Hell, the actors weren't even given  scripts! I'd like to think that most of these same Blair Witch haters, if  given a video cam and a basic plot, wouldn't be able to come up with  something as enchanting as &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;. Though it's  not entirely frightening, it's easy to laugh at many of the comments  made--and even easier to become engrossed in its eeriness in the film's  later stages. The ending itself is enough to warrant the viewing of the  movie in its entirety (and for those who didn't like the ending, that's  only typical of society's need for instant gratification). The film is VERY  watchable the first few times, but LOSES its effect in later viewings. And  for this reason, I think that although everyone should see it, only diehard  fans should PURCHASE it.	4.0	Give credit where credit is due...	1999-12-02	4	2	2

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A23XVF23C7BHP0	"D. M. Farmbrough ""Dave Farmbrough"""	I was very impressed with this film. One of the best aspects of this film for me was that it is only 1 hour 18 minutes long. It is refreshing not to have to sit through so much padding, and I must admit I only nodded off  once during the film. The arguments the three people keep  having are both  funny and realistic, reminding me of my own camping trips when I was 18  years old.The actors seem a bit older than that though,  seeming to be  in their late twenties rather than 18-21. I suppose they could be mature  students.The music is eerie and superb throughout, and when combined  with a decent sound effects track makes for as good a good demonstration of  surround sound as I have heard on a DVD. The good sound quality slightly  lets down the realism, as the sound guy in the film doesn't seem near  enough to capture a lot of what he purportedly picks up with his  equipment.The extras on the disk and the uniformity of design and  atmosphere show that someone has really taken trouble over the preparation  of this DVD. An essential purchase for those building up their  library.Dave	4.0	At last - a decently short feature film!	2000-02-25	0	0	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1XX5797TIZT5Q	D. Mok	The Blair Witch Project fails completely as a horror film -- those who said it was scary probably didn't have enough experience with horror -- and  all the marketing ploys to make it &quot;real&quot; fell short and ended up  sounding ridiculous (&quot;recently discovered footage&quot;?  Give me a  break -- there's no visual continuity with the rest of the movie; chances  are this was shot after the movie became a hit).But The Blair Witch  Project, to me, succeeded on another level -- one of the oldest tricks in  the book, catharsis.Nothing in the movie was genuinely scary -- the  totems, the little bloody something Heather finds, the noises.  Sometimes  spooky, yes, such as the well dressed abandoned house setting, but not  scary.  However, the dramatic tension was quite well done, and the actors  likeable.  When Josh jumps on Heather's &quot;moviemaking&quot;, it's a  pretty touching moment.  This movie also has some good comedic moments  livened up by the spontaneous tone.Whether you'll like The Blair Witch  Project, ultimately, depends on how much visual variety you seek.  There is  none in this movie -- endless handheld shots of trees and growth.  However,  the emotional side of it and the character identification (to me, the only  plane on which this movie's true efficacy rests) worked for me.One  interesting thought:  This script would make a dandy radio play.  The sound  does 90% of the work.	4.0	I'm one filmmaker who likes this movie.	1999-10-26	5	1	4
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1GARWPCAGEAV	"""doctortoxico"""	I hate this movie with a fiery passion like no other.  The movie is about a bunch of dorks who want to investigate some stupid legend about some old, hairy witch that is evil, but not as evil as the creators of this movie.  The whole movie you watch a bunch of total idiots whine about how they're lost and stuff and scream obscenities at each other.  It's like &quot;Beavis and Butthead go camping&quot;, only Beavis and Butthead outwit these fools by a longshot.  The movie is littered with bad special...whoops, I mean NO special effects and vomit inducing camera work (actually the movie itself is vomit inducing).  There isn't a remotely scary part throughout the whole thing.  This movie is a .... pressed onto a DVD and you should avoid it at all costs.  Even the extras suck, judging from the commentary, the directors are complete morons, and the 40 minute curse of blair witch makes you want to flush the dvd down the toilet only more.

Actually saw it in a packed theater and can remember when the lights came up, hearing a young guy with a bunch of his peers say, 'let's go see that new shark movie to cheer up'. Was thrilled to see what the writer's film school teacher dubbed, 'the lamest idea they'd ever heard', turn out to be the blockbuster that it became. I could see how it could have been a bomb, yet the right treatment and the great chemistry of it's three ill-fated stars along with the proper amount of savvy made it work.  I still get some degree of goose bumps when I view it. The only real negative was the horrible sequel the studio had the audacity to even bother making.

But in this flic they use the ""F"" word as they exhale breath.Lugosi can scare me with one glance,true and disturb my day,without saying one word.Does all the screaming in this movie remind one of how crummy the flic really is ? The screaming is like a laugh trac or a cue card saying ""they're screaming in this movie now so be afraid be very afraid""A good horror picture doesn't have to remind one to be scared.But i finally figured this bomb out from watching a Cheech and Chong movie,ever notice how everything is so much funnier when a person is high?They'll sit and giggle for hours over nothing,like the chemicals in the brains laughter center have miswired and synapse uncontrollably.Same thing here only this movie? goes for the fear center,with hysterical auto-suggestion screaming in terror(over nothing i might add).They could hardly tell viewers to go to the theatre high and who but a misguided teen would do it anyway.Instead of giggling themself silly,now they just scream and scream and to quote Romeo,""Come Mercutio,thou talkest  of nothing"".True Romeo, Mercutio does talk of nothing,but in so doing he says so much and more,this bomb is the deevolution of the classic horror flic.And it's just downright ""CORNY""!!By the way the reports of people throwing up during this ""flic?"" is due solely to poor camera pointing not the ""Blair Witch"",if i make you watch a home video and move the camera around constantly,sooner or later you will actually get ""motion sickness""-in a big theater time a hundred motion sickness because the guy filming the picture keeps moving the camera.don't belive me? try it at home with a home vhs and have your seasick pills ready for migraine no.2."	1.0	"attempt to make it artsy by ""black and white"" deep failure,just makes it more corny"	2006-12-16	10	4	6

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A38FVBBQ1YODJW	"""dragline_99"""	This movie gets one star because it's definately more frightening than &quot;The Muppets Take Manhatten.&quot;It was a big mistake watching this. I don't frighten easily. But now, everytime I step out of the house and see  a rock, I have flashbacks. Heaven forbid that I see some twigs, I break out  into a cold sweat. Whenever I go camping and hear the nocturnal birds  flutter their wings against the tent, I lose control of my bowels.There  were some decent points to the movie, it taught me some basic navigational,  survival, and common sense skills. For instance: If you ever feel that you  are lost, throw away your map and trust your instincts instead. Number two:  If you are lost wthout a map, never EVER follow a river to find your way  out of the woods, most rivers and streams flow in circles you know.  Survival tips: ALWAYS pack at least a week's supply of Camcorder batteries,  NEVER a cellular phone. (They take up too much space) Number two: If you  are running for your very life, always take the camcorder with you, you'll  at least have something to whack the noises upside the head with.Common  sense tip: If you are wandering around in the forest and see a bunch of  cute little stick figures laying about, gather them up and take them with  you! You can sell them at a craft fair or flea market!Summary: Great  educational film.Practical, everyday uses for the Video and DVD: DVD can be  used as a coaster, mini-frisbee, circular saw blade (with moderate  modifications,) cat plate, or underneath support for that slightly uneven  table leg. The Video: Can be used to tape all your favorite episodes of  &quot;Mister Roger's Neighborhood,&quot; may serve as a safety  &quot;chock&quot; under your car tire if your brakes ever give out, a  book-end, actual tape may be cut up and used as confetti in a parade, set  up on top of the hamster cage to prevent that pesky little bugger from  escaping, and last but not least, may be used to tape a real horror film  on. This is by no means a comprehensive list. I'm certain others can think  of dozens more uses for this versatile piece of art.Scariest movie since  the Exorcist? NOT!

The so-called movie supposedly consists of amateur film footage left behind by 3 students who disappear in the Maryland Woods. That's the excuse for the movie being so poorly filmed and consisting of random video shots of wandering around in circles in the woods. (Nature-lover that I am, I still found the trees filmed quite ugly. I suppose that was meant to add to the &#34;horror.&#34;)  It's not a horror film, just a horrible one. Utterly pointless, boring, and never the least bit scary. In the first few minutes the &#34;legend&#34; of the witches sounded dubious. After that, the rest of the film elicited only two emotions&#8212;boredom and then anger that I had wasted my time and money on it. Currently, Amazon's choice of a critical review is 3 stars. That's a joke, considering that currently the second most frequent rating is 1-star, and the least frequent 3-stars.

Its the girl's school project; the two guys agreed to help her for a couple of days. While shooting the film, they had to leave their car parked at the edge of a wooded area and walk into the woods carrying backpacks with tent, cameras and other necessities for a couple of days stay. On their return they got lost.I've seen a number of this sort of film, ""home movies"" of events experienced by 'ordinary people' filmed as they seem to be happening. They vary in quality but, some, like this one, pretty well hit the mark of authentic seeming home movies. Shot in this manner, while still a fresh idea, they (and this one), have an interest beyond that of the plot-line. A good deal of that interest rests on the ability of the actors to act entirely as if they were not acting. This cast did an excellent job in that respect.So I would commend the film to most viewers who are in the mood for a kind of hybrid fact-fancy movie. If what you are in the mood for is Clooney and some buddies lost in the woods, this movie will not work."	4.0	Interesting Pseudo-Realistic Film	2013-07-25	0	0	0

Wirdel	I am reviewing this very late...I know, but I never actually got around to buying and watching the film until about a tear ago.H.P. Lovecraft said that a macabre story sinks or swims depending on whether the writer can create a proper, believable atmosphere. BLAIR WITCH does. There isn't much character development except that Heather is an uptight, bossy type A personality and cannot admit her failings. Josh is a slacker until it's time to actually do something and Mike is a neurotic mess. So what? That sets up the interplay between the three and shows why they unravel, but its the dark, secluded woods and its strange noises and the strange, almost Paleolithic artifacts that enhance the movie. THIS IS NOT A HORROR movie. It's an eery, macabre thriller and it's well done.I have no gripe about the film. Heather is a bossy pain because she simply IS. The men in a sense rebel against her and it becomes a story of power and struggle to pull power away from someone who,is too egocentric to have it. The men fail and well...	5.0	I loved it.	2012-06-21	5	5	0

"Okay, so the movie was passable at best, and has not aged as well as say ""The Wizard of Oz,"" but that other movie is filled with happy munchkins and painted horses. THIS movie is dark, creepy, and does NOT have a happy ending (yaay!)To truly understand this movie you really have to step back to 1999 (c.e.) and hear the rumors of ""the Blair Witch"" from friends, the fledgling internet (which has only a few hundred thousand indexed websites anyone really visits, not the billions of pages with youtube and myspace now. In fact, this movie WAS youtube. You see, we all heard the whisperings of some dumb kids who got lost in the forest and got killed. Then the Discovery channel had a special on ""The Blair Witch"" the day before the movie came out. THAT was what cemented the marketing.The problem with the (fake) ""documentary"" was hat it was just a little too transparent. It made you want to believe (like you might want to believe in happy, friendly aliens) but it just seemed a bit cheesy and fake. Then there was the website. It was  an ""almost ran"" but the fact that they were selling Blair Witch merchandise BEFORE the movie opened almost killed the entire scam.So you sit down in your seat of a packed movie house and hear the nervous whispers of everyone else asking ""is this real?"" and then the movie starts - a real documentary. The rest is history. Shaky camera work that gives far too many people nausea, the sudden ending that shocks and angers people when hey realize they just got ""punked"" (before there was a ""Punked"" show). This is movie magic at a time when almost all competing movies were [...] formula - and let's not mention television. This movie shocked th public awake and almost - allllmost worked in a BIG way. If they had played their cards a bit closer to their vests and demanded the public believe, instead of hawking merchandise and fake documentaries for a few extra coins, they would have had a PT Barnum worth masterpiece scam on the public.Nonetheless, the movie cost nothing to make, sold for 2 million at Cannes I believe, and made TONS of money in the first two weeks before dropping off the radar and finally becoming a pariah. forget the sequel. The only value the sequel has is to show young filmmakers that YOU TOO can get funding for your second project sight-unseen, if your first project slaps the general public awake.And that is why this movie is priceless. Watching it on DVD you really lose a lot - kinda like watching the Woodtock (1969 - the REAL Woodstock) movie on DVD. If you weren't there, you really missed the whole point - sorry.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AA5XZVANDXGJE	"""dvdcollector18"""	I consider this to be one of the best horror movies that I own. The film is about three film makers going to film a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch. When hiking in the woods they get lost and then thats when the movie picks up pace. The ending of the film is really sudden and creepy. The reason I loved this film is becuase it was really scary, but they never really show anything. So it lets your imagination scare you, and it leaves you with an impression that you can not shake for a good while. This is really a unique movie expierience.The DVD Picture and Audio are really good considering what was used to film it. The film was never in a Widescreen format, so it is presented on the disc the was it was shown theatrically at a 4:3 aspect ratio. The disc does not have a Dolby Digital 5.1 Soundtrack but a Dolby Surround 2.0 Soundtrack which still is terrific to hear. The sound really has effect on you in Chapter 17 where they are running through the house trying to find Josh.The supplements are very nice on the DVD. First there are the regular Cast and Crew Bios and a couple of Trailers (teaser and theatrical). There is also &quot;The Legend Of the Blair Witch&quot;, where it is basically the timeline of when the events related to the Blair Witch occured. The best bonus is the special &quot;Curse of the Blair Witch&quot;, a documentary that takes place as if the events of the Blair Witch happened in real life. It basically explains all the events that occured regarding the witch that were mentioned in the movie with more detail and explanation. Watching this special really added effect to what had occured in the movie.A few DVD-ROM features are added to, but nothing really special: just some excerpts from the comic book, the Dossier and a copy of the Map from the movie.I based my 5 star review on the film, sound, video, and supplement quality of this DVD.	5.0	THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT DOLBY SURROUND 2.0 DVD REVIEW	2000-11-17	1	1	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2F7PEA3G37YDT	dylan21484nj	"If you've seen The Blair Witch Project, you probably fall in three categories - people who were scared stiff, people who didn't see what the big deal was, or people who got so motion sick that they had to stop watching. It's very much one of those divisive films, and I am proud to say that I loved this film and was left wide-eyed, gripping my seat tightly in the movie theater as the final credits rolled.The film, made for only $25,000 (though some have inflated that amount to $40,000) is presented in a ""found footage"" style, a truly novel approach as the film we're watching isn't being shown through some steady, static ""magic window"" looking in on the characters without their knowledge as nearly all films are presented. Later films like Cloverfield and Paranormal Activity also used the ""found footage"" approach, but this film was the precursor to them all, and every film that has used this style since has often been described as ""Blair Witch  in a Godzilla Movie"" or ""Blair Witch in a House.""Here, the cameras, the film stock being used, and the handheld ""shaky cam"" cinematography are all a part of the story. Presented as recovered film footage pieced together to present the journey of three student filmmakers making a documentary about a local legend who gradually find themselves becoming the legend's newest victims. This cinematic approach and the performances given by the ""student filmmakers"" (who were really a trio of young actors skilled in improvisation) was so effective and believable that many were lead to speculate that the film's events were real. But of course, they weren't. But Artisan Entertainment's marketing of the film harnessed that speculation through websites and message boards (being the first real film to utilize the then-fledgling internet as a legitimate promotional tool) and TV and radio ads that portrayed the film as true events. Moviegoers flocked to the theater to make up their own minds.What they got was the story of Heather, Josh, and Mike, who end up lost in the woods for over a week in late October of 1994 while filming a documentary about the Blair Witch, who some blame for numerous mysterious disappearances and deaths over the span of several centuries. Many days pass as the trio trek through the Maryland woods in their slow descent into fear, paranoia, and desperation. As they hike trying to find their way back to their car, frustrations being to mount as the map they brought proves useless, they run out of food, and the trio begin to turn on each other, bickering and arguing as their situation worsens.At one point, hope of escaping the woods truly becomes lost, as despite walking in the same direction for an entire day, they inexplicably end up back in the same place. It becomes clear that a supernatural force does not want them to leave, a force that leaves haunting, intricately made stick figures and rock piles for the trio to find during the day and terrorizes them by night with eerie sounds in the distance, leaving the trio (and the audience) to only imagine who or what stalks them just beyond the light of their campfire and just outside the view of their camera lenses. You too will peer into the darkness, looking for any kind of clue to what horrible creature is out there waiting for them. And as they are seemingly lead to a condemned house, your eyes are glued to the screen as their grim fate awaits inside.I can only guess why others don't find this film scary. Maybe people are so used to the typical approach of a static camera and smooth camera movements that the handheld approach takes them out of the film. Perhaps they are so used to films that show you a grotesque creature and buckets of blood and gore as a ""payoff"" that their imaginations never take over, and their hopes expectations for a typical payoff are left unsated since you never see the Blair Witch. Maybe they just see three kids roaming around in the woods with a couple of cameras that they can't see the creativity of being able to tell what is essentially a ghost story without the need for a big budget. Whatever the reason, it's truly their loss.The Blair Witch Project is a triumph of minimalist filmmaking, a film whose concept smartly takes advantage of the most basic elements needed to elicit fear, like the urban legend every small town has, the simplistic and natural fear of being in the woods at night in late October, and the fear of what lurks in the darkness just outside of your view."	5.0	Brilliant approach to a film, brilliant marketing campaign, brilliantly frightening	2012-05-16	2	2	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A154G4HBCNHBM0	E. Akamine	I wanted to like this movie. For $80,000, this was a bad production; especially since the noises they kept hearing at night (a rather major plot element) would have been SOOO much more effective if I could have actually  heard them at all clearly, a problem easily corrected in post-production by  the most novice of editors.Dramatic license (a 5-day camcorder battery),  obvious oversights (GPS anyone), and at times hammy over-acting bothered me  beyond the fact the movie  continually gave me flashbacks to my college  video production class.	1.0	MTV's 'The Real World'...

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A174ENPZVL9TWD	Eddie	I think alot of the bad reveiws for this movie come from the overhyped advertising, and the fact that it isn't a horror movie of the kind we've come to know today. I feel people went to see this movie expecting a lot of blood, and a lot of witch. That just isn't the case with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. It is a very creative and original movie that relies heavily on the things you can't see. It breaks down the Hollywood power budget that we see in modern &quot;horror&quot; movies. It takes us back to the time when the things you COULDN'T see scared you. It reminded us that isn't necessarily the witch that was frightening, but rather the crack of the twig behind you. And as the lights went out, and you hear everyone screaming for their lives you can't help but feel locked in this imaginary box in which you can't get out. It is a claustraphobic kind of fear.  If you are about to purchase this movie expecting gore, and teen tv stars, and a 75 million dollar blair witch CGI, then cancel the order or return the movie. If you want a trip back to the basics and a fear that will keep you gasping for air then by all means purchase THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.	5.0	Horror on a different level.	2000-09-24	3	1	2

Heather's final confession, so moving,  chilling, and horrifying on the big screen, goes straight into one's psyche  when watching it at home. the last film that made me scared to go up the  stairs alone was Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING (1965). BLAIR WITCH achieves  this level of horror and at times surpasses the level of THE HAUNTING. The  absence of special effects coupled with the canny use of sound and the  subjective camera translate perfectly to home video. This is a movie  destined to be a classic, and the video transfer is a must for the home  librart of any aficienado of quality scare movies.	5.0	more intense on the home screen than on the big screen	1999-10-25	0	0	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2L1TKGBAVT7ZF	"Edward D. Terhune ""Ed T."""	I really, really wanted to like this movie. The days of independent drive-in-type movies that were made with a minimal budget but lots of imagination are long gone. True, they were often a hit-and-miss proposition; some were great, some were awful, but they were uniformly fun to watch. Not so now. Hollywood has appropriated the horror movie. Such a movie now is a multi-million dollar extravaganza with slick special effects and a cookie-cutter plot. So, I was hooked by the ad campaign for this movie. It was presented as a triumph of the cinematic outsider using a mimimal budget and a lot of ingenuity to overcome the restrictions of an entrenched Hollywood that all too often caters to the lowest common denominator possible. Unfortunately, this film was a great disappointment to me. The shrill, amateurish acting I could have withstood. After all, a lot of landmark horror movies (&quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; is one that immediately comes to mind, or &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;) are not noted for the efficacy of its actors. This plot, however, is pretty non-existent. Basically, it consists of unpleasant people staggering lost through the woods and screaming at each other. Hopefully, one of the benefits of this film is that it will inspire other budding movie-makers to scrape together whatever resources they can and give it their best shot at translating their inner vision onto film. It is to be hoped that such films will be more inventive and entertaining and frightening than this.	2.0	Not What It Could Have Been	2004-04-29	7	4	3
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1C384NS531WXA	Edward Gordon Brown	I will just say this: To the many people who detracted this movie, you either do not appreciate a good movie when you see it, or you had a completely wrong idea of what The Blair Witch Project was about. I could  compare it even to a very well-known (and equally hated) book: William  Golding's &quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot;  That book deals with kids left on  their own on an island without parental/adult supervision of any kind.  Soon, they begin losing their civility and become more and more like  animals. The Blair Witch Project is an excellent film in the fact that it  goes gradually exposing the feelings and fears of the characters in a very  raw and brutal way. They are lost in the middle of the woods and there is  &quot;something&quot; out there stalking them, taking it's time...feeding  on their fear. Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez had a fantastic idea, and  this is one of the most original- as well as effective- films I have ever  seen. Certainly it will soon be a part of my video collection!	5.0	Post this review, please	1999-10-20	0	0	0

For a while, people went to see it and left without really knowing what they just saw, and passed along what  they thought was going on.  In the end, massive amounts of people went to  see the movie to find out the truth, and the truth is this: the blair witch  project is a fake documentary made by a group of improvising actors filming  themselves and led on by a group of directors lingering about but never  coming face-to-face with the characters.  The reason why the story confused  people is because there was no story, and if an explanation ever does come  out, it was written after the movie was filmed.  Basically the movie had no  plot, completely flat characters, no theme, no moral, no backround, no  conflict and no conclusion.  In fact the majority of the film is a group of  confused people wandering around in the woods with a camera and NOTHING  happening.  Althouth the concept was interesting on paper as an artistic  experiment, it was not a satisfactory film and in practice I would never  suggest purchasing this film.  Watch it if you are intrigued, but by the  third time you see it you'll be ready to shoot yourself!	1.0	The self-propelling black hole project: Lets get this right	2000-07-21	5	2	3

Well ladies and gentlemen,apparently this experiment was actually somehow done and The screenplay for this movie was the result. Basically, if have only 100 or fewer working brain cells, then this movie is definatly for you. Buy it immediatly. The plot is good the characters are funny, and it is truely scary.For those of us who can read at at least a 2nd grade level, and do simple math such as one plus one equals 2, dont bother with this .... The people who say that this movie is for intelligent and smart people, are the same people who spend millions of dollars on pet rocks. And then when they bought a pet rock, they bought another one, hoping that they might mate and that they would get rich too by selling baby pet rocks.And for the poeple that say that this is a movie that requires you to use your imagination, that is true. With that being said and based upon the 100+ million dollars that this movie recieved, It got me woundering how easy it is to get rich in this country. It got me thinking of a possible movie i could produce. And this is what I came up with....take a few of those glow in the dark sticks, and pay a few kids to hold them in their hands and jump on the bed in a completely dark room, screaming as if they are being killed or somethinig, and play some scary music over it. Bingo you got a hit. It would be a great movie for all those intellectuals who like to use their imaginations. Basically this movie exemplifies why it is so important to rent before you buy. However this movie does have one good note to it, it would be very good for insomniacs because this movie will lull you right to sleep quick.	1.0	This is it! It finally Happened!!

Everyone was so hyped to see it, including myself!  I went the first week it opened, with my boyfriend at that time...  We were all excited, and couldn't wait to be terrified by this awesomely scary movie...  And I remember walking out of the theater thinking ""WTF?  That wasn't scary.""  We both felt robbed of our money and our time...That said, I have since watched it at home and will say that it really does tend to be scary.  At the time when it was released onto VHS, I lived at home with my parents whose house was out in the country, with forest on two sides.  I got the VHS and watched it one night when I was home alone.  And finally, I felt a little of the terror that this movie was supposed to induce.  The forest, at night, is a scary place.  Especially when you're lost!  So, yeah, I can totally imagine freaking out if while lost I seemed to be traveling in circles all the while creepy stuff keeps happening around me!So there you have it: the creep factor is there for this movie, you just have to watch it in the right setting.  This movie manages to be scary without a lot of blood and gore, which is great in my opinion.  For what this movie is, I say it's well done.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4	Elisabeth	"Going into this movie, I suspected the Blair Witch legend would be similar to the Bloody Mary legend, and it was.  One woman in the film described the Blair Witch as a woman covered in hair...which is what I also heard about Bloody Mary.  However, another man claimed the person responsible for the neighborhood killings was a man who made his victims face the corner before killing them.  And then, throughout this film, it actually seemed like a group of people were the ones hunting people down.So who, ultimately, were responsible for the killings...a woman, a man, or a group of people?  If a man was responsible, then shouldn't the movie be titled ""Blair Warlock""?  Or if it's a group who's responsible, then shouldn't the movie be titled ""Blair Cult""?Because this movie has ""witch"" in the title, but also has these other suspects, too, it made this legend hard to follow.  Maybe the movie should've been titled, ""Blair Unknown Subject(s)"" instead.Another problem I had with the movie is that it's slow-moving in some parts and the whole map fiasco scene was so implausible, it almost ruined the film for me.  But thankfully, other aspects of the movie made up for it.What makes this movie so scary is not what you see, but what you don't see.  You don't see any gore (except for the ""present"" left by the tent), you don't see any special effects or even the witch herself.Instead, you see strange rock formations, eerie stick figures hanging from trees, and hear loud cries in the dead of night.Simple scare tactics, yes, but nonetheless are creepy because they're reminders that this trio isn't alone out there in the woods.Because this movie started out as a hoax as a real documentary, the aim is to appear as realistic as possible.  It succeeds in doing this by using unknown actors, unscripted dialogue, and unsteady camera filming.  The wobbly cam might bother some, but it didn't bother me...which is surprising given how easily nauseated I get.  I guess I was too captivated by the story to care.Watching this movie was fun because it reminded me of past camping trips where we'd sit around the campfire telling scary stories and someone would  inevitably  claim one of the stories was actually true.  This movie plays on the idea that maybe, just maybe, one of those stories  really is  true."	4.0	"Maybe it should've been titled ""Blair Unknown Subject(s)"""	2010-09-30	2	1	1

All told, I was a bit disappointed in the film. The technical aspects didn't bother me at all, but I expected a bit more creativity. Frankly, it's rather surprising that large numbers of people went to see this movie. There just isn't much to it. The setup is too brief and cursory - we don't really even meet the characters or learn much about the legend or see much of the townspeople. And since we're told in advance that no one will be returning, all that's really left is a documentary on how humans deteriorate mentally and emotionally under stress. Not that it isn't convincing, but had they given us a bit more to think about early on, there might be more motivation to keep watching (e.g. ""what did _X_ mean?"", or ""how will such-and-such turn out?""). And does anyone really believe they'd still be filming and carrying heavy gear once survival became an issue? But anyway, credit to the filmmakers for being original and giving us something different. Maybe next time out they could introduce some elements of plot, just to help the conceit along."	3.0	"eek.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3L31489BCB1D7	El Kabong	Sorry to quote Jesse, but I couldn't resist. This movie has garnered much divided opinion; both camps are right. It sucks AND it's great. First of all, immediately dismiss every opinion that whines 'where's the blood?'. Simpletons who need monsters and gore to officially enjoy a horror movie should park their cars on road shoulders and read back issues of FANGORIA while waiting for the next highway fatality to rubberneck. This is essentially a ghost story, and ghost stories frighten with mood and suggestion, not with slashed carotid arteries. But most of the naysayers have a point: after the overkill of the media hype, you DO walk away deeply disappointed after the first viewing. The narrative structure, such as it is, is clumsy and tedious. But part of that disappointment is due to the fact that horror movies are marketed to yahoos, and otherwise-rational viewers have become all too willing to think and act like yahoos when watching a horror movie in a theater. And who can blame 'em, after 20 years of dumbed-down, market-researched 'rollercoaster ride' horror that feeds the mob a steady, predictable diet of CGI, 'dream' sequences, unkillable brand-name psychos, and wisecracking teenage hardbodies. To release a serious, straightfaced, artistic horror movie nowadays is to ask audiences to think unsettling thoughts and FEEL something genuine: far easier to let the latex do the talking over a heavy-metal soundtrack and hope you can con enough kids into believing a 'director's cut' DVD of ELM STREET 12 is a statement for the ages worth owning. Now, while BLAIR WITCH is far from perfect, it does have one 'monster' that no fx wizard could ever approach...those damned woods. Anyone who's ever gotten lost on a camping trip, or even driven through the woods at night, knows exactly what I'm saying here. There's something deeply, frighteningly eldritch and pre-human about wooded areas. Nature isn't Bambi and Grizzly Adams...it's harsh, unforgiving, cruel, remorseless; the territory of elder Gods who predate our warm and fuzzy civilized notions of deities and divinities. To live out in those woods and survive extracts a price so terrible that our ancestors finally fled, formed societies, created cities....ain't NOTHING scarier than the wild. As the three kids in this movie venture deeper into the woods, I felt a deep intuitive foreboding forming in the most primitive jelly of my brain. They're doomed because they've learned to be afraid of people but they've forgotten to be afraid of Nature, and deeper they go into a place where the very terrain- the rocks, the trees, the dirt beneath their feet - is the predator stalking them. All the faux-hostility they've learned from rap music and schoolyard brawls can't help them now. If you saw this flick and left the theater underwhelmed, see it again, alone, late at night. You might think twice about preserving any rainforest anywhere. The 'movie' part of BLAIR WITCH may be weak tea, but those haunted woods are scarier than any weightlifter in a hockey mask.	4.0	Stay Out Da Bushes!	2001-10-27	10	8	2
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2BSN9IIQPALN4	Elle	Originally saw the movie in the theater and remember being scared for days. Perhaps, it was the cleaver marketing behind the movie and less internet access than today to read the IMBD and see that the actors are in fact actors.

I don't want to give away anything, but if you have never seen it I would watch it for the heck of it, but I can't understand how Roger Ebert gave it 5 stars and the following quote is from his website, &#34;The Blair Witch Project,&#34; an extraordinarily effective horror film, knows this and uses it.&#34; Uhhhh I don't understand how this is horror, but give it a try and see for yourself!	3.0	Not sure why I was so scared when it first came out	2014-05-05	0	0	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A17C46GMYHZHPE	"EmeraldAccord66 ""Rebecca"""	"I gave this wonderful scary little flick a 5 Star Rating because it's really got a lot of scary moments that if you put yourself in the actors shoes and pretended in your mind for one second ""what if that was me out there lost deep in the woods?"" then it would FREAK you out too just as the actors portrayed! For these kids who had never really done real acting before this was actually very very good. They did a wonderful job I thought and on a low budget and pay as well. Just to get my foot through the door into acting and Hollywood, I sure as heck would've played Heather in a heartbeat! I would've been so scared that my acting wouldn't have been acting but true terror put onto reel because it would've been REAL!!! :)Going by Amazon's rating system and comments it doesn't look so well but I think over all it did great considering it's a very low budget film and for the fact that it did what it was suppose to do - bring in the bucks and more for the people who made this little flick. People have been and still are very curious about the movie (fiction or non-fiction) that it still sells well even on DVD. If it was so bad then people wouldn't even waste their time purchasing the DVD or wouldn't have gone to see the movie in the first place.For me, when I read the synopsis about a movie or watch the trailer and it doesn't really interest me or I say eh? maybe, then I don't waste my time on it. So this movie did pretty well over all I think ever since it came out and still does it seems.Now what I'm wanting to know is, could someone PLEASE give me their opinion or if they absolutely know about the last scene of the movie I would greatly appreciate it because it sure doesn't make any sense at all to me how it ends with Heather running after Mike with her camera through the house only to trip on something apparently and drops her camera which lands on the dirt floor only to show Mike standing in the corner of the house and all you see is his back side and then it ends. Now that really sucks and isn't much of an ending if you ask me! For one thing, Mike was to have tripped and fallen himself before Heather gets to the room he's in and then she trips over something and the camera lands on the floor. So why to find him back up standing in the corner? Just standing there and that's it? That is really beyond lame. As a Director I would've def. ended it very spooky and leaving the audience to have something REALLY scary to think about where the ending could've been ended in several different ways but something that made sense and even to see maybe a shadow of a Witch in the corner where Mike was standing like beside him or somewhere in the room. But to end it the way they did just didn't make any sense at all. Would love someone's take on the ending too if they know it or have a good explanation to it PLEASE reply me here! Thanks! :)P.S. - Blair Witch II was just horrible. All mixed up and really didn't make any sense whatsoever. Could've truly done a much better job than that piece of crap of a movie. Hoping a really good Director in the near future will make a Blair Witch III but will pick up where the first one left off a few years later and take it from there and not show another follow up to the second one which were just B. W. followers getting doped up and acting foolish the whole way through. Unreal!!! :( A Blair Witch III now days if Directed the right way and really creepy and good almost like the first but MUCH better and with a better story line then it could even top the first one by far and sell by the billions at the box office as well as DVD/Blu-Ray.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AXFI7TAWD6H6X	Erica Anderson	I remember when I first saw &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; back in '99, I was absolutely blown away that a little low-budget movie such as &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; could be effectively scary but without the neverending violence and gore like in the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, &quot;Halloween&quot;, and &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; movies. The director's approach to filmmaking was refreshingly different. He didn't need to rely on the same predictable garbage that Hollywood churns out every single day. To a certain extent, I still feel that way. I think it is possible for filmmakers to make a scary movie but without the relentless barrage of blood and violence (in no particular order). Now whenever I throw in &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; into the ol' VCR, the movie just doesn't seem like what it was when I saw it in the movie theater. &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; is still good in the sense that it lacks the corny special effects and the overuse of violence to engage the viewer. When I do watch this movie, I get annoyed with the three actors. Heather gets on my last nerves with her snivelling whining. Josh and Eric yells too much. Heck! All three of them yell and scream too much for my poor ears to take. Profanity isn't an issue for me. It is the yelling that is way too much. I still love how the movie ends though as well as the black and white cinematography.	4.0	One of the more original horror movies	2003-10-30	9	6	3

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A13TNUUEZBP6SS	Eric E. Wegner	"After recently seeing the enjoyable but flawed ""paranormal activity"" I was inspired to revisit this movie.  I first saw it at 18 y/o, when it was still in very limited release (at the time I think it was only at one theater in Chicago).  I walked in knowing the general premise of the movie and knowing it wasn't ""real"", but the movie still provided me with probably the most impactful movie going experience i've ever had (at least on a visceral level).Never before or since had I had such an overwhelming sense of dread walking out of a theater, and the ending of the film was something that lingered with me for weeks later.Repeated viewings, however, didn't hold up as well.... I imagine due largely to the fact that there isn't an inherent entertainment factor to the movie (the dialougue is naturalistic, and as such isn't particularly clever or entertaining), and due to the fact that there was no way the movie could live back up to my initial viewing.But watching it again after roughly 5 years, I was reminded of what is/was so great about this movie.  As many others have already said, what we can't see is always more frightening than what we can, and that's what the entire movie is based on, but equally as frightening is the idea of the unknown... that is to say, to not know what to do, to not know what will happen to us next, and in that sense the film really excels.As we watch the three filmmakers wander through the woods, becoming more and more lost and running out of options, the viewer becomes more and more caught up because we don't know what is going to happen next.... the conclusion is never obvious or (IMO) foreshadowed in a conclusive way.  As movie watchers we become so used to conventions of genre that more often than not we know how a film will likely end as soon as it begins, and 99% of the time we know whats headed for the characters before the characters themselves know.  Blair Witch does not allow the viewer this comfort, which makes it all the more unsettling.As such, the ending comes as a shock, and the use of the house at the end, after over on hour of wandering through seemingly endless woods, is about as effective of a horror device as I've ever seen used.But be forewarned, in order to really get the most out of this movie, it needs to be watched intensely, that is to say in a dark room, without family/friends talking, without a computer in the background, without the phone on.  If you just half-watch the movie, you will get next to nothing out of the amazing last 20 min, and will likely end up among the many other one star reviews."	5.0	Modern Horror Classic	2009-10-29	4	3	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A384ID3VKB3POY	EricH (eh7thflcoe@aol.com)	First things first, for film students they did a terrible job operating that camera.  I don't own a camera, haven't filmed more than a few minutes  using someone else's and I can hold a camcorder steadier than that girl!!!  The look of the film was enough to show that it was amateur, the over  exaggeration of film &quot;control&quot; was a pointless additive.  Now we  come to point 2, they were COMPLETELY UNPREPARED!!!! I am an avid  outdoorsman, and, ya know, the last thing on my prep list when I go into  the back country is how to read a compass or better yet - the map!!! And  what a menu! Days in the wilderness - can't forget the marshmallows!! The  only one that exhibited any forethought is the guy who threw the map in the  river, he knew it was only weighing them down!!! (But, I guess they could  have used it to sop up that girls tears later in the film) Well, I guess I  am being a little harsh because I wanted to blow chunks before they even  headed into the woods.  The idea was good, but steadier camera shots would  have allowed those of us a little weaker in the equilibrium department to  get our stomachs under control.  It also would have allowed me to care more  about the characters - instead I felt I was in a worse predicament then  they were! Anyway, back to the point, the ending and beginning were the  strongest parts, the middle dragged because the dialogue was repetitive.  Although when . . Josh?. . disappeared and they heard him in the distance -  obviously feeling the effects of the female camera work - that was  disturbing and rather tense, that is until they decided to do the brilliant  thing and go running through the night after a &quot;witch&quot; who was  obviously in better control of the situation then they were, but that's a  whole other review altogether.  O.k., I've rambled on enough, but let me  say that it was an original idea and was good on content, but the filming  could have been a little better thought out and either the movie should  have been shorter or the dialogue a little better (the around the first  fire scene was pretty good - more of that would have been great).  Ok,  that's enough from me - &quot;A&quot; for effort, I look forward to seeing  some later works by our gallant group of Knights (Go UCF!).	2.0	AND THE STUPID SHALL DIE IN MARYLAND	1999-10-28	1	1	0

Half of the people who saw this movie were sure it was a real documentary.  I can't think of any other movie that had that kind of creative touch.  Scary?  You bet!  It was a classic pyschological thriller.  Almost no violence at all and you never get a glimpse of who/what is the Witch.  You simply had black and white and three kids in the woods.  Add some mysterious happenings and internal conflict - you have the mixings of a great movie.  The ending of this movie, to this day, still gives me chills.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2D8CUJPOSRPNA	Erik North	"Not since NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD in 1968 or HALLOWEEN in 1978 had a low budget horror film grabbed the entire nation in the way that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT did when it was unleashed in the summer of 1999. Made for only forty thousand dollars by a group of friends in Maryland, BLAIR WITCH, by way of media and Internet hype, grossed over one hundred million.As everyone has heard, the film is about this group of teens who venture into the Maryland woods to learn of a legendary witch, only to find themselves confronted with the possibility that the Blair Witch is not merely a legend but is in fact a reality. One has to give credit to directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez and their friends, including the ever-pushy Heather Donahue, for giving the audience something more than just the standard teen-scare flick. The witch is (wisely) never seen, except for a few markings and demonic-looking stick figures. There's hardly any gore either (praise be!), and even the Shaky-Cam movements are bearable because you know they could never afford even part of a Steadicam on their highly limited budget.That said, however, I am only giving this film three stars, because this film falls lamentably short on two very important points. The filmmakers put up a great premise that has traces of John Boorman's 1972 classic DELIVERANCE scattered throughout, but the dialogue is so profanity-ridden that it becomes tiresome after a while, diminishing the film's suspense-laden story. Secondly, the acting, even by student-film standards, leaves something to be desired. Even Donahue's ""I'm so scared"" scene (done with a flashlight) doesn't seem terribly realistic.Does THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT still live up to the hype? In terms of its premise, I'd say it MORE than does. But if its makers had been willing to spend more time on the dialogue to reinforce the premise and the energy that went into making it, we'd really be talking about a masterpiece. As it is, BLAIR WITCH is a letdown of sorts, but only partially so; it's not the masterpiece some claim it to be, but it's not exactly a disaster either."	3.0	Split Decision On This PROJECT	2003-05-09	3	1	2

The unexpected is in every shot of the film, ritual marks, frighten night sounds, isolated woods, the  panic of being lost, guilty feelings.  No one can see who is haunting this  group of youth persons.  Camping, in such conditions is really a nightmare.  If you saw Deliverance, 197?, a group of far mountain residents takes an  explorer group men as haunting animals.  In the Blair Witch Project these  three youngs are taking in such manner.  We can't see who use them as  sadistic victims, in the final scenes, in such scary situation, all she has  to do is scream, scream, scream...	4.0	A new version of Deliverance	2000-03-07	1	1	0

From when I originally saw it to this day I could never come up with a reason why some people thought this piece of trash was good. This movie was by no means scary, frightening or anything of the sort. It was only a couple of people screaming at a camera and throwing it at trees. This movie has no redeemable qualities that make a good film. Most of the movie is people yelling out F*ck at leaves while the camera is filming the ground. If what your looking for is good, intelligent Indy films then look elsewhere.INTERESTING FACT: This film was in the Guinness Book Of World Records for &quot;Top Budget:Box Office Ratio&quot; (for a mainstream feature film).

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A97Q71MM5N4NW	"Everett ""Future Raptured"""	"This has got to be by far the most scariest film I have ever seen in my entire life. You're not sure what to expect throughout the whole film. By the reviews it had gotten, I wasn't really sure what to expect. People I knew said it was not scary at all. Some other people said it was the freakiest thing on earth, and all the rest were pretty much mixed reviews from Amazon.com. I was open to anything at that point, and just wanted to be scared for a changed. I got more than I bargained for, by an independent film company, I was totally surprised that with a budget under 22,000 dollars, that they could make a movie so good, and so real, it was scary.The Blair Witch Project follows the story of three young college kids who just want to make a film based around the legend of a witch back in the 1700's that has carried on through the present time. Heather: the leader of this so-called movie crew, Josh: her partner and friend in the business, and Mike: their skeptical sound man are all ready and excited to explore the unknown. But then the three become undeniably lost in the woods just outside of Burkittsville looking for a cemetary. But there's more to the documentary than meets the eye, literally.Camping out the first few nights, eerie crackling sounds soon come from the distance beyond their campfires light. Heather anxiously wants to find out what it is, but Josh and Mike just want it to go away; wouldn't you? Voodoo dolls are unwantedly found by the unaware trio hanging all over a group of trees, and that same night, children's voices soon surround the area right outside their tent, and the three are attacked. And when Josh suddenly disappears the next day, Heather and Mike aren't even that confident that they can get out of the spiraling vortex the Blair Witch has them trapped in as the two slowly fall to pieces within their own sanity.I think the thing about the Blair Witch that made it the most scary and hard to get away from was the fact that you can hear all these sounds coming from the woods beyond them, yet the whole time, you never see a thing of it. The movie leaves your mind to do the imagining of what these three really are hearing, which is more scary than anyone can even think about. Is the blair witch really after them? Who were those children, and what did their ghosts look like after Rustin Parr murdered them?The special features on the DVD are pretty cool. You get the SciFi documentary on the Blair Witch ""The Curse of The Blair Witch"". It also has a commentary by the five main producers of the film which gives some pretty cool insight on how primitive everything really was when they made the film, and how everything they did made everything all the more scary beyond your TV screens sounds. And I know, the big complaint mostly on the movie is the fact that people are getting motion sickness. I'm probably one of the though ones that can take it probably because I've watched so many home movies, but it's understandable. For people who easily get motion sickness, steer clear of this movie. You'll be puking left and right.As far as the acting goes, these three unknown actors who go by their real names give such a real portrayal in the ways of their characters desperately trying to get out of the woods, it sends chills up your spine. Their acting almost takes you out of the movie, and into the story their telling all by themselves. Although I could've gone with the use of the ""F"" word so often, but hey, if you listen close, that's how people talk these days, even at my high school. Pretty sad if you asked me.But, I really liked the original idea of having footage found and using it as the surroundings to the movie. It's almost as if it's actually being showing right out of the characters eyes, rather than from your own view. You see what they see, and you hear what they hear. No more, no less. And when things even become intense, you feel what they feel. Immediate five stars to the most original, and the most frighteningly real movie of our time.

Just originality and a very involving and disturbing story that dominate the public and  silence them, as the movie proceeds and the expectation increases. Whatever  is said concerning The Blair Witch Project is not enough to describe the  experience of watching this movie. It is a psychological experience. You  have to feel the terrifying atmosphere of the woods near Burkittesville,  Maryland, and the despair and suffering of Heather, Mike and Josh, the  three student film makers who disappeared in there. All the movies, from  now on, are going to seem kind of artificial. The Blair Witch Project is  really scaring because it is scaryly real. It seems so real, so  spontaneous, that you forget the fact that it is just a movie.

The only thing more interesting is the website itself. I felt the fear, the terror, and the liquid magic of  the filmmakers. (I actually hated driving at night and heard strange  noises). No film has ever made me afraid since the Exocist (I was only 8!)  but Blair Witch made me a believer. It was slow at first but the film  stock, B&amp;W then color, even the variations in sound quality, made the  film a wonder. It was sort of a &quot;Scream&quot; without the $50 million  budget but with more harrowing results. The film class the directors  attended enjoyed a robust 150% increase in attendance the following  semester though I think the writers, the cast, and the directors deserve  the credit. &quot;I'm so scared&quot; (of my credit card bills this  Christmas)! The tent scene with the kiddie voices scared me to death!  ...and reminded me to stay in the studio unless I am on location with a lot  of staff, a few uzis, and some troops. -Felecia Constance Rowe, C.E.O.,  Teardrop Films	5.0	Brilliant! 50k becomes $100 Million - Take Notice Hollywood!	1999-12-01	0	0	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A26NLSTT75FMJM	"finulanu ""&#34;the mysterious&#34;"""	"To be honest, I have never cared much for horror movies, other than the few Hitchcock films I have seen. Especially not slashers. I really, REALLY hate slashers - thankfully, this is not one. Now I didn't see this when it came out (I was in elementary school), and as I got older, I had no interest in it. But I was recently at a gathering with a couple good friends, and this one creepy guy who thinks he's my friend but is very wrong. Now, among the many creepy things about this creepy guy is that he has a freakish obsession with horror movies (though there are many other things that scare me about him, we're getting off topic), and since our gathering was just after Halloween he decided he'd bring a few of his favorites along. This absolute waste is one of them.Everything about this film fails miserably. Even the famous ""apology"" sequence seems forced, because I can't draw any emotional connection with our three protagonists, who seem to do little more than wander around in the forest, screaming and swearing at each other. My idea of good dialog is not, ""F*** you! You're so useless! I can't believe you f***ing dragged us all the way out here for nothing!"" and so forth. My reaction to them is at best apathetic.The film does start off interesting, with various interviews of townspeople about their experiences with the Blair Witch - when you can hear them, that is. But that lasts ten minutes or so, and even then my interest is only modest. During the end, which is supposed to be a chilling experience, I am terminally bored. There are no scares at all here - one scene I found to be disgusting, but that's about it. The plot is sketchy at best; the characters aren't fleshed out at all; the spastic camera angles give the film an authentic documentary feel but rend it unwatchable; and the ending is predictable before the first scene ends. I know have one less reason to like the creeper who forced me to sit through this pile of excerment."	1.0	The worst movie I have ever seen	2007-11-02	12	6	6
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1HKMA30PHGUEV	"""flamingtree"""	I have come to the conclusion that with this movie there is no middle ground. Either you really liked this movie or you hated it.I saw this movie the first time at the theatre surrounded by teenagers(how did they  get in in the first place? Someone wasn't doing their job of checking ID's)  From the opening words I was hooked. This is the best scary movie in a LONG  time.After the movie was over,I listened in on what some these teens  were saying. The majority of them seemed to not like this movie for two  main reasons....You never see a &quot;boogeyman&quot; or what have you. And  they didn't get the ending.Part of the problem I think the majority of  people had with this movie was they needed to use their imagination to some  extent. Todays young people have always had everything set out for them.  They see the &quot;boogeyman&quot;. They see exactly what happens to the  people in other films,quite graphically usually. They aren't familiar with  unknown sources of evil,and their imagination has not been put to good use.  . Your imagination can provide you with far more horrific scenarios than  what can be put on film. As for the ending apparently they weren't paying  to close attention to what they were seeing and hearing.The terror is  there lurking ever so quietly just beneath the surface. The slipping sanity  of the victims. Strange noises,lack of sleep,slowly losing your grip on  reality,a place haunted by previous evil........It all makes for one  terrifying ride if you just let your imagination have full reign. What did  happen to Josh,Mike and Heather? Let your imagination go and you will be  terrified.If,like me,you loved this movie,check out Picnic At Hanging  Rock.	5.0	A thinking movie	2000-06-17	3	1	2

With so many of horror movies trying to scare you so much by showing you everything that makes you feel uncomfortable, I give credit to a movie that shows that it is what you don't see that makes your blood tingle and your fear rise.The documentary approach was great. It made the story seem real, unlike so many movies that rely on these overdone special effects and gimmicks to scare the audience. I think that when a person goes to see a scary movie, he or she needs to feel uncomfortable; this is what this movie did. Much of the panic that the audience feels is from the dialogue and helpless situation of the 3 people out in the woods. You get a first hand view of the problems, and the terror that maybe something is actually after them.I think that most moviegoers have been lulled into believing that special effects and blood is scary; this movie proves that a story does not have to ""wow"" you to make you feel scared. Any movie that can make you feel uncomfortable to walk alone at night for awhile is a scary movie that did its job.

The plot is by now very well known, however this moview is neither scary nor entertaining. It is impossible to feel what is on screen is actually  occurring (or did occur) hence making it jsut as impossible to be scared by  the movie. As a horror movie it failed me. The script and acting are so  bad, that watching BWP is worse than having to read a dreadful novel for  your high school english class....the first 20 minutes or so of the movie  are unbearable, worse than bad documentary.

Let me tell you now; I'm a very squeamish and easily frightened viewer(I practically had a heart attack when a certain little girl crawled out of a certain TV-you know which movie I mean!) but this film did not have me diving behind the sofa cushions. Not even a little bit. It starts out good; the tension is there alright, but because it is set 'film documentary' style there is no atmospheric music to set the scene, which means any tension or atmosphere has to come from the actors. Maybe I'm missing the point, but a bunch of teenagers running around in pitch black woods whispering the 'f' word over and over-and yes folks, a good five minutes is spent where you can't see a darn thing and can only hear the sound effects as the kids drop the video camera and screech terrified obscenities to eachother-doesn't really entertain me that much. Even then the volume had to be turned up ridiculously high just to hear what they were saying, then turned down again in disappointment as I realised I wasn't missing much. I found the scene where they emerge from their tents and practically have a hernia over some re-arranged twig formations more funny than ominous. Was anyone else willing the Blair Witch to pop out and say boo? Anything would have been less laughable than twig formations!! It is true that a good horror flick can entertain you not by what it shows, but by what it doesn't, but here is where the movie fails. Had the teens been stalked and chased down by an evil presence then it would have been frightening and entertaining, instead we have three college-age idiots lost in some woods and behaving like hysterical, well, college-age idiots. 'AHHH!! A re-arranged twig formation!!!' Please. Can you say 'low budget?' Give us viewers some credit! And I won't go into the disaster that was ending. Just as the movie builds up some tension and genuinely grips you to the screen, the credits roll. I had to go back to the title menu screen and repeat that scene just to make sure the DVD hadn't skipped. In the words of Comic Book Guy...'Worst Ending EVER'.Bless Heather Donahue, for she was meant for things far greater than this.Well, thankyou for taking the time to read my little review. I beg of you not to waste any more actually viewing this movie, if it weren't for the foul language it would barely make a PG certificate.

When I was told that it was a true story, when I was told that the documentary ""The curse of..."" was true, I was shocked. Shocked that a commercial product was made upon three unfortunate students ! When I learned that the whole thing was just a hoax, I felt some relief for the young fellows but I also laughed out loud. Before learning that a hoax it was, I had watched the end several times and couldn't find some logic in the behavior of the ""panicking"" threesome. One is left behind, one is running forward, Heather is keeping on screemig and doesn't seem to be holding the camera as she sounds too far away from it. But she sill wants to shoot, whatever happens, even if being hurt by an unseen attacker. You can't do nothing when panick gets hold of you. You can't think. You just drop anything you carry and run blindly in front of you. That didn't seem to happen.

I saw it in the theater after hearing good things about it, and let's just say my reaction of extreme disappointment is an understatement. The only thing that this movie left me with was motion sickness. Here's a quick rundown. Three people decide to take a trip into the woods to find the legendary Blair Witch. As they go about their daily duties, they eventually get lost. Their imaginations start to run wild, and they become convinced that the witch is after them. These are the things that scare them: piles of rocks, piles of leaves, and stick figures. Some people were scared by the fact that the characters just didn't know who was doing these things. You never see anything, or have any concrete proof other than legend and hearsay to actually believe there is a Blair Witch. You're just supposed to assume ""the witch"" is doing this. In conclusion, if rocks, leaves, and bad camera work give you the willies, you'll be scared for days!"	1.0	Don't Waste Your Time or Money	2002-12-12	3	1	2

I love it.  And here's why:1.) Atmosphere - the film does a great job of capturing a dark, dreary atmosphere that descends into unsettling night time scenes.  Also, shooting it in the woods removes the characters/victims from the ""normal"" world, making the suspension of disbelief easier.2.) Acting - you get the impression throughout that these people really know each other.  Also, you can clearly see the degeneration of their spirits, from the party attitudes at the beginning to the absolute despair Heather sbows in her ""final message"" to family and friends.3.) The ""less is more"" principle - movies that dump tons of gore and special effects on you are usually making up for bad acting, poor script, etc.  Blair Witch Project does a fantastic job of scaring the viewer without ever showing the menace that's stalking the characters.  See ""Joy Ride"" for another film that does this superbly; also ""The Haunting,"" the 1963 version.Good acting, atmosphere and chills - not bad for a movie made on a shoestring budget.

You know that's not how it was but yet...could it be?  There is no masked psycho in the Blair Witch nor an evil monster hidden in some swamp.  What is creepy about this film is the realism and the mounting suspense.  You are waiting for something to happen; something to crash out and say ""Boo!""  You don't know exactly what that something is but you eagerly view on.  The ending may not be graphical in the sense that blood and gore horror flicks are but it does make you think and best of all, lets you use your imagination and deduction.  Despite the fowl language and immature behavior, you can't help but feel a bit for the three main characters in this film.  What would you do in their situation?  It may not be everybody's cup of tea and yes the camera angles get dizzying but as a riveting suspense flick it delivers a full blast.  The documentary, ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" is also worth a viewing and is presented here as bonus material.  It perpetuates the story and while at times you simply want to scream and say ""none of this is real folks!""  It again draws you in a twisted way.

That's the best part of this film, since most viewers knew it  was just a mock-umentary of three kids searching for a witch in the  Maryland woods.  The fear is totally self-induced.  It's all in your mind  and in what you IMAGINE is out there.  It doesn't rely on slasher gimmicks  to frighten you.It also struck me as impressive that no music is used  and yet we still felt the terror build up throughout the film.Downsides:  the profanity is a bit overdone, (I mean, people curse, but  hardly THAT much!) and Heather's bossiness gets obnoxious after a while.  I'd say rent this once even if you saw it in the theatre, just so you can  answer any questions you had after the first viewing.Bottom line:  This is NOT the kind of horror flik you will play again and again.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2KSRJFZ2R9JK3	Fuwwyfootpaws	The Blair Witch Project is a really effective horror film and I find it is truly underrated. It is filmed in ''Found Footage'' style, and it is about three students who are doing a documentary about a local urban legend. They go around the town of Burkittsville interviewing random people about the ''Blair Witch'', a ghost who supposedly many years ago haunted a man named Rustin Parr and made him kill many kids from the town. He would make one kid face the wall and he would kill the other, because he didn't like the feeling of the other kid staring. The people also say that the woods near Burkittsville are apparently haunted and that the Blair Witch still haunts a cabin in the woods. After they interview many people, including a woman who supposedly saw the Blair Witch face to face, they go to their hotel room and they call it a day. The following day, they go to the woods and they film constantly. During the film, they get completely lost after one of the guys throws away the map. During the day, they find piles of rocks placed in front of their tent, they find voodoo dolls hanging everywhere in the trees. At night, they hear wood cracking, a little girl laughing and screaming, and their tent gets shaken by a spirit outside.They run and scream and argue a lot during the movie, and some people may get exhausted from it, but I didn't. I thought it was well made and well acted for an extremely low budget movie, and the scary scenes are really scary, surprisingly since we never really see anything.

Simply put, if you don't like to use your imagination, if you want  your entertainment vanilla-flavored, mass-market, and spoon-fed, its not  the film for you.

The acting, despite some people's  uninformed opinions, is first-rate.  These characters are people you  know--perhaps all these people who insist that the characters were too  whiny and argumentative to be realistic need to look in the mirror and be  honest about what they're like on a stressful day.

To mention one thing, it doesn't stumble into the pratfall to which most American genre flicks succumb &#8212; that of thinking a horror movie has to be a slasher flick.Blair Witch functions entirely on a psychological level, and while it may not be the scariest film out there, it is very intriguing - enough so that I rank it among Horror's greats.The acting in this film is all superb, and the Oscars, performing one of their classic idiocies, failed to nominate any of these fine young people for actor. The performances in Blair Witch are ultra-believable and realistic. Of course, that has a lot to do with the flying-by-the-seat-of-your-pants style of filmmaking that was used to do this movie. Much of the dialogue, etc., is improvised. These guys actually lived out in the woods for the duration of the shoot and the filmmakers left basic instructions and parameters for the actors each day, as well as their ration of food (which, by the end of the shoot, was reduced to a piece of fruit and a power bar per day). The actors did not know what was going to happen from day to day. Granted, this allows for a lot of real fear and tension, thus negating some of the need to conjure the emotions through acting, as would be the case on a normal movie set, but there was a lot more need for improv on this shoot and the actors performed admirably.I think the reason I didn't find this movie as frightening as some reviewers is BECAUSE of the reviews. Too much hype can ruin even a great film, which this is. If I had gone into this movie cold, the experience would have been much more intense. So I don't blame the movie - I blame the studio.Nonetheless, this is a powerful, intense and original film and watching the situation and characters decay as each day passes and they become more and more desparate is, at times, riveting.This is very much a character-driven movie, something else that sets it aside from most other horror movies (the sequel included, which felt like an interesting story populated by standard, cardboard slasher characters/victims).I understand why many viewers didn't like this film - simply because the average viewer really has no interest in the avant garde, which this film definitely is. But I encourage those viewers to consider Blair Witch objectively and not automatically dash it simply because it didn't live up to expectations. It went beyond expectations into a totally different world, the reason I like it.The documentary feel of the film also helped tremendously. In that way, this ranks as one of the most realistic horror films of all time, a definite contributor to its effectiveness. I'm very interested in pop sociology and pop culture, and I am very impressed (though also frustrated) by the filmmakers' accomplishment - creating such a massive, bona fide urban legend. Lest you argue that it isn't really a true urban legend ... well, I'll give you an example. I got into a discussion with an acquaintance of mine who was so taken in by the publicity approach that he thought that not only was the movie a chronicle of a real life disappearance - but he also thought some of the footage was real! I have another friend who &#8212; despite having visited the Burkittesville Web site that explains that the Blair Witch legend and town of Blair are not historic &#8212; still believes in the Blair Witch!In case you're wondering, that's the frustrating part about the filmmakers' creation. I get more aggravated than I should by people who don't realize that the legend was deliberately created.Also, I'd like to touch on the film's lack of a widescreen version, in answer to a previous review. The reason the DVD and video aren't widescreen is that the original film is not widescreen. Even in the theater, the picture was square due to the types of cameras used to shoot the movie.At any rate, The Blair Witch Project stands out in my mind one of the greats &#8212; a major milestone in the history of horror cinema. I  went ahead and only gave it four since my full enjoyment was a bit tempered by too much expectation and hype (something Hollywood does all the time, to the detriment of its product).	4.0	One of Horror's Greats	2001-08-31	5	1	4

Let me qualify that statement:  Jim Jones was a genius; the Enron scam was genius; and many others.I was prompted to go see this film because of a very engaging and ingenious Sci Fi Channel program (which I later realized was a one hour commercial for the film).  The one hour program was scary and interesting.  The film was anything but.The Blair Witch Project tells the ""true"" story of a group of twenty somethings who go investigate the legend of the Blair Witch in some remote part of Massachussetts or Maryland.  Using nothing but video cameras, the fimmakers intent was to give the film a raw and documentary feel to it and then go so far as to promote it as being a real film - the last film by this group of students - as they are supposedly killed by the Blair Witch.The video cameras used jump around so much that I became quite queasy watching the film.  The scripted dialogue (yes, it was actually scripted) is cheap and amateur.  The climax of the film is such a ridiculous thing that it is amazing that it did the business it did.  And, boy, did it do business.I can remember leaving the theater and overhearing a girl, sobbing her eyes out, talking about how horrible it must have been for those people to die like that, and how someone should do something so that no one ever has to die like that again.I laughed my head off at that.  And then I got angry.  I got angry that anyone could be so monumentally stupid as to believe the ridiculous story that had just been portrayed on screen.  But then I comforted myself that most people are that stupid and to this date there was no law against stupidity - even though there should be.Laughably bad and ridciulous!"	1.0	"Should have been called, ""Ha ha, we took your money!"""	2003-02-26	19	11	8

There is not one scene in here that is absolutely terrifying. The cameras are cheap and the picture is grainy...so what? This movie is fantastic! The atmosphere is amazingly chilling and dark. The acting is mostly all real. The cheap picture quality and shaky movements just increase the intensity. We see the blair witch through the character's eyes, and not from God's. We know just as much as they do. We follow them on their journey through the dark and haunted woods as they search for a local legend called the blair witch. We hear about her in interviews with the townspeople in the beginning. She gets built up in our minds and doesn't leave.I watched this movie alone at midnight, turned up pretty loud. It was althogether, a terrifying experience. When you look back on this film, you don't remember one scene in particular, you remember the whole thing. All these slightly scary things are happening that all add up to something very frightening.

But in all honesty even when it is at its scariest, it really is not all that terrifying.  The way the  cast and crew (which are the same people) went about making this film is  really quite brilliant.  The film a mock documentary that gets more  paranoid and more frightful every minute.  I was thrilled to at least see  such originality.  The sad thing is though that these same people that act  in these roles just do not cut it as actors.  I actually found it almost  humorous watching these three people stumble around in the woods, screaming  and cursing at each other.  It began to look very fake and very dumb fast.  I won't give away the end even though most probably already know it but I  will say it was one of the better parts of the film as predictable as it  is. Though the idea of the film is fantastic, it gets completely ruined in  the end.  These three definately have hope as filmmakers in the future but  they need to brush up their acting skills first.	2.0	A great horror film ruined by stupidity	2000-05-04	1	1	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A7Y6AVS576M03	gobirds2	THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was an interesting independent film that really had an innovative idea. However that idea fizzled after about 20 minutes into it for a few reasons. This was due mainly to the very obnoxious behavior of the would-be adventurers who set out on this supposed ghost hunt. These adolescents use four letter words in such a preponderance of pseudo intellectual ineptitude that I was hopping that they would all just vanish without a trace. They are the crudest, asinine and most repugnant characters I have seen in film for some time. Are we really supposed to care what happens to them? This is a film aimed at the teenage market. Are parents supposed to let their children be exposed to this offensive material? This film could have been presented without the use of the four lettered words, but I suppose the filmmakers would find that not politically correct. That was then. Looking back, I see some good film techniques that make it unique. It captured a certain look and it actually reminded me of Dudleytown, which is a ghost town in Cornwall, Connecticut. I was there three times when the public could walk through. To its credit, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJRCT did capture something that was definitely a bit unsettling walking through the forest that is now Dudleytown.	3.0	STILL GLAD THEY GOT THEIR COMEUPPANCE	2000-09-07	4	1	3
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2MK6FYM4MVPFD	Gojoe	The Blair Witch Profect has gone beyond being a cult film, or another fleeting trend emitting its pulsating &quot;ping&quot; on the radar screen of popular culture, it has become a bonafide cultural phenomenon. Why?  Partly, because the movie is brilliant, (trust me, its frightening), but  that alone does not sufficiently explain why masses of the population  rushed out to see this film  It has touched something much deeper inside  us, something primitive, ancient.For those of you intellectually stunted  people who insisted on rushing out and seeing &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;, or  (Ugh) &quot;Runaway Bride&quot;, instead of something of quality, I'll give  you a brief synopsis. Three 20-someting student film makers head deep into  the woods of Burketsville Maryland, formally Blair, to explore the legend  of the Blair Witch, a centuries old supernatural menace that town folklore  has blamed for a wide range of bloody, and mysterious atrocities. On the  second day of shooting they become lost in the woods, and on top of being  hungry, cold and frightened, they are terrorized in the dead of night by an  eerie, noisy, and unseen presence, that becomes more menacing with each  passing night. The film's directors, along with a trio of incredible young  actors have managed to take &quot;Cinema Verite&quot; to a new level with  this gem of a film, but I'm not reviewing it, so you'll have to go see it  yourself. I'm only attempting to explain the psyche that is driving the  phenomenon.First, the movie has re-introduced the witch in its original  form, a dark, evil aberration of nature that lives in the deep, thick of  the forest untouched by the hand of man. In medieval times, the deep  unexplored woods were believed to be a portal to hell, where Satan's  minions sprang forth from the fertile soil. Romanian folklore draws time  and time again on the concept of vampires, wolfmen, and other shape  changers, as creatures who emerged from the forest in the dead of night to  terrorize villagers, and the unfortunate tourist arriving late on his  journey. Without the means of modern science to explain crop failures and  drought, or the forensic tools to understand the socio-pathology of the  serial killer, supernatural folklore was accepted as sound reasoning to  explain away the horrors that plagued the short, and often harsh realities  of European life in the middle ages. These ideals were brought back in full  force during the American colonial period, where the puritans, despite the  fact that they built their new country on the foundation of escaping  religious persecution and ignorance, brought back the concept of the  inherent malevolence of the dark woods. Centuries have since past, and a  new age of science and reason has replaced the superstition that now only  finds a warm bed in re-runs of the X-files, and Hilary Clinton's evenings  with the ouija boar. But can years of evolution be swept away that  easily?My wife the biologist, when reading my rough draft for this  article, summed up what I'm trying to get at quiet nicely. She opines that  the reaction to Blair Witch is not much different than the need to re-enact  other primitive urges inherent in man. The impulse of man to hunt for sport  is really a re-enactment of the times when man's survival was dependent on  his ability to kill in order to provide nourishment for his family. His  fascination with violent sport, wrestling in particular, may still be a  remnant of a spark left in us from primitive ages when physical prowess  ensured the future survival of your lineage. It would later find other  incarnations in the gladiator's ring, and the Roman Olympiad.As the  necessity of these actions become obsolete, they still survive in the form  of ritual, which serves as vehicle to satiate these engrained urges. While  it would be a leap of logic to try and argue that the success of Blair  Witch owes itself to the need to pacify some bizarre impulse to be  frightened, it is undeniable that the movie has triggered something not  experienced before. The most frequent comment I hear about the movie, is  that viewer's find that the film stays with days after they went to see it.  They find themselves jumpy, and on edge. Some, like myself, experienced  strange nightmares the night after they went to see the movie, as if some  tiny switch, long dormant in the recesses of our brains was switched on  again. A primitive fear within us, resurfaced, because of the gritty  realism of a low budget movie. So does all this sound like the boring  thesis of a nerdy academic? Maybe, but tell me how a weekend of camping  sounds after you go see the film!	4.0	Joe and The Blair witch	2000-03-28	2	0	2

Three student film makers decide to delve deep into the Maryland forest to do a  documentary film on the legendary &quot;Blair Witch,&quot; who is supposed  to reside in these woods.  At first, there is laughter and good-natured  joking around as the students hike along, cross over streams, use the woods  as their &quot;bathroom,&quot; and pitch their tent for the night.  However, when the trio becomes hopelessly lost in the woods then discovers  some freaky symbolic rocks and sticks; plus begin hearing eerie noises at  night that create the sensation they are being &quot;hunted,&quot; the  formerly carefree atmosphere quickly turns to one of fear and panic!  If  you put yourself in the student's shoes, you can't help but feel their  terror.  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat, the entire time.  It's  truly an original.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	ASZGMRMYAW473	Grant Wise	In what is arguably the most hyped movie in recent years this really is a movie that you will either love or hate. It difficult to categorise this  actually as a movie, because it resembles so much a tv documentary that you  would watch on late night tv. The main reason this got so much attention  was the hype though - as for weeks we had it drummed into us that it WAS a  scary movie and it WAS a movie we HAD to see.I watched this movie the  night we were moving, in a nearly empty house, alone, and late at night -  as I basically wasn't expecting much from it, alot of people had told me it  was not scary, and basically annoying, it was seemed to become the 'cool'  resume of the movie from those who went to see it.Its true, it starts  slowly, with the 3 characters running around interviewing people, and  because of the hype, you sit there just wishing they would get on with it -  and get into the woods and start screaming their heads off. The main  irritation of this movie is the way it IS shot by a simple camcorder, and  therefore the picture quality is relatively poor, the shots are often not  totally on the bits you want to see, and obviously you have the shaking  camera. A move which was supposed to add to the tension and make you feel  like you were really there, it didn't do that for me, it just became an  irritant that I had to try and dismiss.The one stroke of masterpiece in  this is the periods of black, where you only hear voices. Granted, it meant  sitting there trying to entertain yourself visually by looking round the  room, but it created tention beyond belief, as you have no total idea what  is going on, and the unknown is what makes this movie truely  scary.Despite what everyone said, it IS a very scary movie - but only if  you get really into it - had I been down the cinema with a group of mates,  I'd have laughed at the silliness of it all, but being alone, I really got  caught up in it. Its hard to call the acting great, because they tryed to  pass it off as though it was a set of trials for the actors and they were  meant to be acting on instincts, although that seems to be rubbish, it is  by far the most unauthodox movie in terms of creation, this decade.The  plot is original, but follows a similar vein to many scary movies, but the  real attraction of this movie is that is it basically is very scary. Its by  far the scariest movie I've seen in many years - but I persoanlly don't  find people being slaughtered with huge knifes scary at all - a la Scream  et al.It basically a movie you will find good or bad, the main  attraction for me was that is was scary, although its not something you'd  watch for scriptual enjoyment. The ending is very abrupt and you have no  idea what has gone on - and that is in many ways a bad move - but the  restrictions they put themselves under by making it out to be a found tape,  meant they couldn't have an over view camera to show all - as you  despirately wish they had - by the end. It does however have to be highly  commended for actually doing what it's genre suggests - and IS horror,  something not seen for years. And for that reason alone - it is worth  seeing.Whether you laugh through it, or cower through it, you WILL  appreciate that this IS a highly original style movie, and it is worth  seeing - even if it is just to claim it wasn't as the hype suggested, but  at the end of the day if you prefer big budget movies - it is known for  costing $10,000, and it is VERY obvious.	4.0	Blair witch hype or horror?	2000-08-01	4	2	2

Of course, can a film shot on standard def video really benefit from a high def transfer.  As it turns out . . . not really.I didn't honestly expect this to offer an improvment in video or audio quality and it certainly does not but I'm a big fan of BLAIR WITCH so I made the trip to BestBuy (they have a two month exclusive on it) to get it early. It is an okay disc for $10 and there are a couple of things I like better about the bluray over the DVD. The odd 16mm projector windowbox that was used for the DVD transfer is gone giving us a standard 1.33:1 aspect ratio which is the way I remember it being during the theatrical showing. I thought the picture looked just a little bit better than the DVD with the color being slightly more saturated. I thought the audio sounded about the same as the DVD even though this bluray has a 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. It didn't offer that much improvment.The extra features are the same as the ones included on the DVD except the are rather poorly presented on this disc without a hard encode of pillar boxes so depending on your setup you may have to fiddle with the aspect ratio. The only new bonus feature consists of 4 alternate endings which are also poorly presented, forcing the viewer to watch more than a minute of the same footage on each alternate take before the ""new"" footage is shown. All the new endings really do is confirm that this film wasn't as ""improvised"" as the producer and director would lead you to believe on their commentary track.Lionsgate has added their usual warning screens, and forced bluray advertisements and trailers which must be manually skipped over. At least the disc is not BDLive enabled so the loading time is fairly quick.If you are a huge fan of BLAIR WITCH then you will want this for $10.

It either scared them or it didn't. Doesn't seem like there is an in between. Well my opinion is an in between opinion.The Blair Witch Project is a different movie to say the least. It's unique in that we never see the killer or demon that is supposedly causing all the mayhem and destruction. The movie about 3 young adults doing film research on the legend of the Blair Witch. The research takes them deep into the woods in the middle of nowhere. As they get closer to their goal they begin to hear voices and noises in the middle of the night. When things get too creepy they decide it's best to go home. At that point, however, they realize that the map showing them the way home has disappeared. That part of the movie was actually pretty funny. From there the movie takes off and has a decent ending, but I've seen better.The movie isn't really all that scary but if you let your mind wander, just let it slip into the movie, and make yourself believe that it is a real story and that was you in the woods lost with some unknown demon after you it could give you some chills. Hey it worked for me. The acting wasn't academy award worthy by any means but the actors give believable performances in portraying their characters.I do believe that The Blair Witch Project would've gotten better reviews if it weren't for all the hype and hoopla that surrounded the movie. Any movie would have a hard time living up to that. Check out The Blair Witch Project and see what you think.	3.0	Some Like it Some Don't	2002-06-20	1	0	1

It lurrs you in with being deceptively light in the beginning,  but you share the &quot;filmmakers&quot;-Heather, Mike and Josh in their  fear.  I also hit the website and discovered the history behind the blair  witch (well, if you call fiction history), and that enhanced the movie's  experience ten-fold.  I caught all the subtle nuances that the director  threw in that most the people watching didn't.  I particularly liked the  certs  (gotta hit the a&amp;e blair witch site for that explanation!).  It  was a low level scare up until the end, and I can still see the ending in  perfect detail, as if I was watching it at this moment.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A37DLVPKJZGSQF	Hannibal	No one could see The Blair Witch Project coming. First, it just looked like your ordinary horror movie. But, then, when you were sitting down and watching it, you realised this is not about some masked creep going round the town with a knife and slaughtering teens. No, this is much different. The Blair Witch Project reminds us that the creepiest things in movies are in fact the things we can't see. The things you can only imagine how terrifying they are. The film gives us this message in a very original way by showing 3 student filmmakers hike into the woods to discover the truth of the local Blair Witch legend in Burkitsville. We see their hand-held documentary and exactly what happens out there, and its enough to make you not sleep for a straight fortnight. This is a movie that you can look at from every different angle, and from every different one, its somehow reflected inside of you. It's weird, but it makes sense when you watch it. The Blair Witch Project comes highly recommended.	5.0	Highly original and freaky as hell.	2001-06-09	4	2	2

So I am content that I have not added any more money to the pockets  of all those who have made a fortune out of this utter waste of shelf  space!This movie is about three people out in the woods doing a  documentary about a local myth based on a supposed real story of children  who went missing a while ago, a legend is formed involving superstition and  witchcraft.  We follow these whinging, individuals through their journey  watching through the eyes of a camera filming sporadically their  misadventure of IMPLIED terror.  I struggled to watch this nauseating film  with characters that were so obnoxious that I cheered when they were never  found again!

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A16KRCLLTHSB5F	Henry Platte	This film deserves four stars on the merits of its production values alone. The level of realism is just incredible, in dialogue and delivery - of course, it was all improvised, but it takes talent to construct a realstic dialogue about something that isn't actually happening. If the filmmakers had somehow managed to pass Blair Witch off as an actual documentary, it would have been almost credible.Is it really scary, though? I admit, I was terrified while I was watching it, but mostly because I was _waiting_ for something terrifying to happen. The film does generate suspense, and then it never really follows through. When it was over, though, I didn't exactly feel dissapointed, I was just left wondering if there would have been any way to milk more horror out of this excellent premise. The presence of even one really grotesque image might have caused a few heart attacks - the thing in the bag and the handprints didn't exactly do it for me - but then again, it might have ruined the atmosphere. I can't say, but overall I don't think Blair Witch is the scariest movie ever made, only a very good one.	4.0	Is Blair Witch Scary?	2004-10-30	0	0	0

Anyone who thinks that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT does not deliver sufficient chills, knows very little about atmosphere and mood.  This film fills the viewer with dread and the same desperation the characters feel by the finale, which is really spooky.  The fact that the creators built a whole mythos just to put the whole thing on handheld cameras and have it witnessed firsthand by the ""filmmakers"" is truly original and extreemly cool.  What you don't see is really scarier than some lame make-up effects or CGI.  The viewer acctually has to use their own imagination which is rare in this day of 'we'll show everything now, because that's what people want.'  This erie tension builds slowly, however that makes it all the more tense, and the documentary style puts you in the middle of the woods with the doomed characters.  A truly clever and creepy movie to be savored at night, highly recommended.  Avoid BLAIR WITCH 2, it's nothing like this one."	5.0	Scary movie, really.	2003-02-01	2	0	2

A classic of new filmmaking, and a brave example of making a good movie for the sake of making a good movie.  The filmmakers love film, and understand storytelling better than most folks making similar films.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A11MEOGS457YCN	horrorflicker@hotmail.com	I found the Blair Witch Project quite scary, despite what other people have said.  The good thing about it is the fact that you can never see exactly what's scaring them (what exactly is in the package that Heather  finds outside the tent, is Josh alive or dead at the end, etc.?)  What I  don't understand is whether Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard and Mike Williams  actually know what's going on.  Are they acting, or are they really scared?  I know none of the scary parts are actually real, but do the gang think  they are?  Please E-mail me that answer on  horrorflicker@hotmail.comAnyway, the movie is something special.  The  directors have taken a risk at the film, which might not have worked, but  it did work, and they must have got loads of money from it's sucsess.  It  is one of only a few films that delivers genuine chills without classy  special effects and needless gore.As I've already mentioned, the ending  had me wondering.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2BSLCT7OPZ33E	"""horrorjunkie"""	Month before &quot;The Blar Witch Project&quot; hit Theaters Nationwide,Artisan Entertainment pulled out all the stops in their promotional Campaign and billed The Blair Witch Project as one of the  Scariest Movies ever.By adding on a fake Documentary about The Blair  Witch(which aired mostly on the Sci-Fi Channel)  and The Region where these  strange things where happening,Artisan Entertainment even covinced some  Airheads that the footage and events in the Movie are real(Believe it or  not,but i ran into some of these Airheads)Being caught up in all the Hype i  eagerly went to the theater expecting one of the best independent  Horrorflicks ever,but after an half hour or so into the Movie my  dissapointment grew bigger and bigger.Instead of watching a horror movie,i  became witness to the exploits of three foolish College students lost in  the woods. Their constant complaining,whinning,crying and screaming got on  my Nerves very quick,one of those lost fools even decides to throw away  their only Map,deeming it useless,go figure....Also the ending could have  been treated differently,instead of trying to explain why and what made the  three lost Fools dissapear,i believe it would have been more effective to  leave the audience in the Dark.All in all,not a bad premise for a Movie but  poor execution and hats off to Artisan Entertainment for a great  Advertising Campaign.My Tip,watch the Mock Documentary &quot;Curse of the  Blair Witch&quot;,it's far more entertaining then the actual Movie  itself!	1.0	The Great Blair Witch Hype Project	2000-06-08	6	1	5
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3FUBUJAIGM87T	"HorrorMan ""HM"""	"The movie ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a one of a kind film that is completely based on the premise that ""sometimes what we don't see is what really scares us the most,"" and in many ways, this is quite true.  Indeed, this movie shows us very little blood, no gore and the audience never gets a view of the villain, but in a way, this really works because it keeps the audience in suspense and builds tension in the audience for the entire movie and, as a result, the audience's imagination runs wild.""The Blair Witch Project"" is actually done like a home movie in that there are three teenagers doing a documentary on the legend of the ""Blair Witch"" deep in the woods of Maryland.  The movie starts with a lot of interviews as a good documentary should and the audience gets a taste of what the teenagers are looking for or trying to discover.  The interviews produce some very interesting and scary stories and some horrifying death stories involving the disembowelment of some hunters.  Heather, Josh and Mike are the three teens or twentysomethings (hard to tell their age) in search of the truth behind this legend...is it truth or myth?  Well, in this movie, they are about to find out.The entire movie follows Heather for the most part as she walks and sometimes runs through the woods with her video camera catching the reaction, mood and fear of the group as they discover that the Blair Witch is a real witch and not just a ghost story.  The movie screen shakes as a video camera would on the run on an uneven and treacherous surface as the woods/forest can be.  The teenagers capture evidence of strange pieces of art involving rocks and sticks and the audience is left to assume that this is evidence of witchcraft in the making.It becomes obvious that the three teens or early 20-somethings are being toyed with by someone or some thing, but as the movie progresses and the audience sees these witchcraft-like works of art (which I found very effective), it becomes more apparent that the Blair witch is for real and these kids are in serious trouble.The group constantly fights amongst themselves as they try to find a way out of the woods, yet they go nowhere but in circles as the Blair witch manipulates the direction of the group and toys with them while hunting them in a terrifying fashion.  By way of criticism, the movie does hit a lull, as basically, the movie can only go so far with this whole idea of the documentary and really not revealing anything about the witch at all, much less does the audience see the witch.There is a sense of horror though as we follow these kids through their terror in the woods and as Josh turns up missing and Heather finds a present from the witch in a bundle of sticks.  So, the film is quite creepy, but it could have been even better if it had allowed the audience to get a look at this horrifying creature or witch, but that's just the point with this film, isnt' it?  The creators of this movie do not want you to see the witch because any conventional or made-up depiction of the witch could deflate the horror in the movie and make the movie look ridiculous.  In fact, the movie does a good job of making the audience wonder if there really is a witch or just some psychopathic serial killer in the woods.At any rate, the movie provides an eerie feeling to the audience which climaxes with the disappearance of Josh and the subsequent search for Josh that leads Heather and Mike to the lair of an obvious child murderer and perhaps a monster beyond their and the audience's wildest imaginations.  Indeed, an imagination is absolutely critical to enjoying this movie as the director is basically attempting to create suspense in this movie for the audience to the extent that the audience's imagination runs wild with conclusions and mental depictions of what the witch would look like that would be scarier than anything that the creators of this flick could put in front of the audience.  Indeed, to actual present a manifestation of the witch to the audience would be to limit or minimize the scary aspect of the imagination and the unknown which is what the creators of ""The Blair Witch Project"" rely upon to instill horror in the audience.  Therefore, the audience never actually sees the villain.  Hence, this is the charm of ""The Blair Witch Project"".I would be remiss if I did not warn that this movie is not for everyone and the viewer should not overexpect, but I proudly own this DVD as I think it's a good and original horror flick.  However, I also believe in the premise that this movie is based on, and that is that ""sometimes what we don't see is what scares us most"".  That said, I would like to point out that you can only go so far with this concept the way this concept is implemented in this movie, and that in order to create the perfect horror movie or a horror movie classic, you have to pick and choose moments in the film to show some things while not showing other things to really bring the horror home to the audience using a mixture of the abstract nature of the imaginations of the audience and the substantive and tangible horror of the film itself to create a very eerie and downright scary atmosphere which is essential to the creation of a great horror movie.In short, I really liked this movie, but, unlike many people, I never really looked at it as attempting to con someone or being conned to be believe that something like this is true or false, although many people hate this movie for that very reason.  I think the situation about the kids getting lost, getting angry with one another, being scared and the prospect of something evil being present in the woods hunting these kids is enough to create some degree of horror in and of itself.  I also thought the witch art was creative and effective at producing a fear of the unknown, a fear of evil if you will.  Another aspect that I really liked about this movie and which was very effective at creating horror was the setting and situation of the movie and the realistic and documentary-type feel which produced an atmosheric type of horror, which as I eluded to above, required the viewer to use his/her imagination.All things considered, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a VERY HIGH 3 STARS PLUS horror film that is quite good but not quite great enough to reach FOUR STARS status on my grading scale and not quite an all-time classic by any stretch of the oh so important ""imagination"", but as many other reviewers have stated, ""give credit where credit is due"" because this is a scary movie and the beauty of it is essentially this: gore is not scary in and of itself but the atmosphere/setting, situation and storyline ARE scary and that is what makes ""The Blair Witch"" product so good.  Unfortunately, there is not enough substance to ""The Blair Witch Project"" to make it great cinematic horror, but this movie is still very refreshing and very effective from a pure horror movie fan's perspective.  This movie really makes use of the ole adage: what we don't see is what scares us most, and I really like that as too much is being revealed to the audience and this sometimes dilutes the horror that the film can generate.  However, with that being said, this movie could have been an all-time classic with a little more substance and concrete depictions of horror."	3.0	3.99 STARS: Sometimes what we don't see is what scares us most.	2005-03-03	4	2	2

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1SGIQO12RBFGU	"I. Clough ""Schmeeze"""	Blair Witch - why should you be scared?  This is a film that all true nightmares are made of.  I wasn't scared in a way that say 'Halloween' would frighten me.  That was a very visual film with genuine, frightening  moments, but it requires no imagination.  The chills are laid out on a  plate for you.  Fair enough - there's nothing wrong with that.  If you like  that sort of horror movie then the 'Blair Witch' is probably not for you.  The minute the 'Blair Witch' started I was reminded of the days that myself  and friends used to camp out in the woods (bear in mind I am from the UK  and not the US).  I have no idea of what the US camping experience is like.  In the UK, we used to go camping in the woods with specific purpose of  scaring the living pants out of each other.  We would do our utmost to  freak each other out, which took very little effort.  The feeling of  walking through the woods with little or no light was enough to to put the  chills into you.  This film brings back exactly that very  same feeling to  me.  It made me feel claustrophobic.  That in itself is an attention  grabber and automatically left a bad taste in my mouth.  Very much in the  way 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre' did.  Secondly, even though you know the  characters are acting, they appear to convey a certain genuine feeling  which reminded me exactly of what it was like to be stuck in the woods  alone, with only the people around you to rely on - which quite frankly is  not much comfort.  The feeling that no matter how much you scream, no-one  will hear you and if they could, they probably wouldn't care anyway.  I  don't have much more to say at this time.  Suffice to say, i've literally  only just finished watching it, and although I don't at this moment feel  scared, i'm slightly freaked out as I know I won't have a comfortable  nights sleep tonight, purely because it brings back haunting memories from  my early teenage years.  I would suggest watching this film with friends in  a party atmosphere.  It will give you something to debate and probably  won't affect you in a way it would if you watched it alone.  I am 29 years  old.	5.0	Why you should be scared....	2000-01-19	0	0	0

The bad reviews are written by people who's minds are conditioned to extreme gore, & a certain format & type of modern horror.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2YXGASP5UCTGQ	Ilze Bars	What an excruciating waste of time!  I waited 90 minutes for something to frighten me.  Then I realized that the most frightening thing about this film was the hype and all of the accolades heaped upon the  writers/directors.  You know a film is in trouble when within the first 35  minutes or so you are hoping that all of the main characters come to some  gruesome end AND as soon as possible!  Besides wasting time watching this  film, the only thing I regret is that I have to give it at least one star  in this review.  Zero stars is not an option. Do yourself a favor and buy a  Hitchcock video.  ANY Hitchcock video.  You will thank me later!	1.0	The Blair Witch Fiasco	2000-07-30	6	4	2

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A319SKSB556033	"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews"""	This film has been harshly judged. It is a low-budget film school experimentation and I am going to review it with that in mind. Artisan  really did hype this film up a lot and people judged it like they would any  other movie.We all know the plot. 3 campers get lost in the woods while  making a documentary about the force that eventually kills them. With the  minimal of money the makers, of this over-exposed movie, create a good deal  of tension and raw excitement. Of course there are a few logic errors but  I'm kind-hearted enough to see past that.Although this film is shown on  a 1.85:1 screen in the cinema the entire movie in is 1.33:1 because it is  all shot on video. The photography may be jumpy but it didn't make me  seasick like it did to some people. It is a little strange to film  everything that is going on but if they didn't there would be no movie.If Jaws made you feel afraid to go in the water The Blair Witch project  will make afraid to go wandering in the woods.One last thing...it's not a  true story.The DVD is in Dolby surround and is in fullscreen.	4.0	Judge it on its own merits, not on the hype	2000-07-29	2	2	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A13V2MTMAV9K2	"""jackvaldez"""	It's amazing how BWP has actually split people evenly into the pro/&quot;I love it&quot; to the con/&quot;What the hell is this?&quot; crowds.  I for one loved this film for it's &quot;chill&quot; factor.  I've been watching horror films (Hammer, etc.) and reading horror books and comics (King,  Barker, etc) since I can remember, and I still think that BWP is by far the  scariest piece of fiction ever made largely due to it's realism and the way  it prompts viewers to &quot;visualize&quot; the implied terror in Heather  and crew's film.For maximum effect (especially for those who  &quot;just didn't get it&quot; including a number of my friends with whom I  have been heartily debating this for quite some time now), I'd suggest  buying this DVD (it's really worth it especially given the fact that it's  loaded with special features such as the  fake documentary et al coupled  with its low price relative to higher priced DVDs whose only so-called  special features are interactive menus - as  well as one or two theatrical trailers) and watching  &quot;Curse of the Blair Witch&quot; first before viewing the feature film.  Then, as a recap, try getting a copy of the BWP Dossier which more or less  goes a step further in providing an epilogue of sorts to the film with a  post-investigation &quot;seance&quot; of sorts conducted by Buck Buchanan  and party at the site (Rustin Parr's house), with spine-tingling results!  At best, you'd really, really get scared and at worst, you'd probably find  the whole thing still unintelligible but still you can't deny and keep from  being impressed at the overall effort and creativity exhibited by the maker  of BWP in propagating the whole mythology.	5.0	See the film, see the documentary and read the book!	1999-12-21	0	0	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A10E0IZ8TY5XRR	Jaelin B.	... however, I feel that it fell short of the image that the film's terrific marketing portrayed.  The movie started out really strong... the ending was *very* impressive.  Unfortunately, everything in the middle left  a lot to be desired.  A lot of it just didn't seem believable.  Also, I  think it would have worked out a lot better had the actors been able to  improvise three words without one of them being a particular expletive.  Let's face it... if I used the word &quot;Pineapple&quot; in this review,  as many times as they used that interjection in that film, the word  &quot;Pineapple&quot; would probably annoy you quite a bit.  As horror  movies go, this one was definitely a refreshing change from the  computer-animation and special effect-saturated &quot;horror&quot; films  that have been released in the past few years.  Although it didn't really  scare me, it did register about a 7 on the 1-10 creepiness scale.  It might  make me think twice about camping in the middle of supposedly haunted woods  without any communication devices (perhaps a cell phone would have really  saved those kids a lot of grief?).  Certainly worth checking out, but glad  I didn't pay to see it in a theater. Five stars to whoever did the  marketing, though.	3.0	Unique... great concept...	2000-07-16	2	1	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1GWGB6L1E4TTT	jaginomoto	I am one of those that grew up with the SCI-Fi now SYFY channel.  Now when this movie was about to premiere, exactly one week before the SyFy Channel promoted the documentary on the Blair Witch.  At no point however, were you able to &#34;google&#34; it and find out what or how much of it was real, the web was only 5 years into it and not as full of info as there is now.The documentary, &#34;Curse of the Blair Witch&#34; was also released as a DVD, but should really be watched prior to the movie in order to understand the full backstory.  Also at no point in the documentary does it say that it is fake or concidentally relate to real peope.Now with the documentary in the back of my mind, we caught the matinee show, which premiered at 2pm on a Thursday I think, theater was packed and there were long lines waiting to get in as this did not open in the major theatres only in the small art house or independent movie theatres.We watched it from beginning to end with not single comment from the audience.What made this movie believable aside from the documentary was that the movie company stated that they found the footage and there were never any real actors, or rather known actors, promoting the movie.The movie then was the first of its kind to be shot in hand help cam corder first person, live action, think of what we see now with Paranormal Activity Movies or VHS, but the movie company tells you it is real.After the final scene everyone in the movie theater exited as quiet as can be, almost in shock at what we had been witness to.  Had we seen a real life paranormal occurrence?Why weren't the police, the FBI, the Warren's involved in this case?Truth came out the following week after records were being set at the box office that the movie was not real and that the people (actors) were very much alive.  Man!Not since HG Wells' War of the World has a (movie) company put that much creativity into a storyline.The kicker of it all is that you had to watch the documentary, otherwise, you have no myth to build your belief upon what you are seeing, there are not connections as to who or what may be in the dark, what areas in the woods you may be desecrating.Watch the documentary first then watch the film.  At this point you may be desensitized to the genre but your be much more informed.Cheers.	4.0	Needed to be there.	2014-03-09	1	1	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AZ8K0NSCMPKSX	James Cox	Scream? I Know what you did Last Summer? Were they supposed to be scary? Those are more like comedies. But &quot;The Blair Witch Project is different. It is up to you to decide what the noise in the woods is. When you let your imagine fly, it is much scarier than when you are simply being chased by some guy in a ghost mask. People who didn't like this movie just didn't actually think about the situation. Some also think that it would be no big deal being lost in the woods. The movie was filmed near winter, and it makes the woods the absolute best place for a horror movie. Nature looks dead and just plain dreary in this movie. Believe me, you would not want to be there. The acting is not bad, mainly because most of it is not acting. They improvised most of their lines, and it made the movie more realistic. Like I said before, when you must use you imagination, it is a lot scarier. You don't know where the noise is, how far into the woods it is, or what it is. All you see at night is a small layer of trees and just blackness. If you were there you can not say that you would not be scared. If you want to see this movie, you have to take the time and actually listen to appreciate it. Watch it at 2:00 A.M. with all the lights off, and use good headphones with the sound cranked up.	5.0	The Scariest Movie in a long, long time	2000-10-13	7	5	2

It was this and  the fact that I was with a friend that stopped me from walking out. As for  scary, nope, not for me, you want scary? Try something else for scary (not  scream though, thats more like a comedy.) Maybe its just not my type of  movie, but I just hated it.

Anyways, I remember seeing this at the theatre and just laughing at the jokes and the  mediocre acting.  I did like the ending a lot.  I can't deny that the  ending is brilliant and really brings the whole movie together.  But I  thought it moved slow and wasn't scary enough.  That's because I was with  friends.  We took the thing a little too lightly.  When I watched it on  DVD, alone, at midnight, I got a whole new experience.  I had to stop it at  the part where they lost Joshua (the hippy guy).  It just became to freaky.  To this day, I cannot finish the movie.  I worry that it might keep me up  all night.  It really bothers me.  My house is surrounded by woods so I'm  sure that makes a difference.  You people can't sit there and tell me that  you'd walk out into the woods alone right after seeing that.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	ARM52YJWYRE2B	Jason Gerstein	OK, the BLair Witch phenom is best characterized by two words, &quot;good marketing&quot;. All the credit should go to the advertising companies on this one. The movie itself was about the equivalent of a home video made by  my 9 year old brother on a family camping trip. For the most part it's just  wobbly camera work(which isn't that bad) and an occasional person banging  on the outside of the tent. I was more scared in Boy Scout camp. The only  redeeming part of this movie was the very end, and by this we're talking  the last 3 minutes or so. The acting was bad, the &quot;scary&quot; stuff  was so cheesy, and the plot was pretty weak(&quot;oh we're still lost.  let's go this way&quot;). The idea and concept of it though wasn't half bad  and I think that if they'd had a decent budget it could have been good, but  coming down to it in the end it's just a movie that's 98% people wandering  through the woods and 1.5% people looking at twigs hanging on trees, and  .5% semi-scary. Give me a Scream anyday for the scare factor. The only way  I could see people enjoying the movie is if they thought it was real, and  that these people had actually died and this was actually their footage,  but I think the people that believe that should be shot because they're  obviously idiots. Too many people are claiming to like this movie because  it's the &quot;in&quot; thing to do. Watch it on your own and I can  guarentee you'll be rushing out to see anything else that even resembles a  decent movie. Godzilla, Batman and Robin, The Avengers, and The Postman are  just a small sampling of movies that demolished this one(to give you an  idea of how bad this actually was). For the DVD specifically it did come  with some nice added features though.	1.0	The DVD extras were the best part. The movie was terrible.	1999-10-19	0	0	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3AXYN330VYRM7	Jason	I absolutly loved this movie! Many people criticize this movie because you never see what is hunting the people in this film. THATS THE WHOLE POINT!  When you go see a horror movie and you see some monster, you can  say to yourself,&quot;Thats just special effects.&quot; In this movie there  are no special effects, and yet the actors make you believe that something  is out there, and that it's after them. The camera work and the sometimes  bad picture quality make the realism of the movie even more effective.  This movie plays on childhood fears. Like the monster under the bed. You've  never seen it, but you know it's there, and thats what makes you hide under  the covers. The Blair Witch Project has the same effect.  SO, if your in  the mood for a really good scare, not just cheep thrills and gore, rent The  Blair Witch Project. If you don't find this movie at least creepy, then you  have no imagination and I pity you.	5.0	Truly Scary	2000-02-27	5	3	2
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1DAACM69LH60U	Jason Jones	This movie was good in some ways and bad in others.  Many people do not like this movie because of its ending and/or bad acting.  Well, most of this movie was made with no script and I belive this made it more  realistic.  Though, many of the scenes were over done.  The people in the  movie seem to &quot;freak&quot; out way too much at certain parts.  Also,  the profanity is way too excessive... there had to be at least 150+  f-words in the eighty minute movie.  Overall, the movie is worth seeing if  you like the horror genre, but others may want to shy away from this movie.	3.0	Interesting	1999-12-03	1	0	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3UGLMD1GKIZGR	"Jason Robey ""horakhti"""	"Forget the entire backlash spawned by the hype, forget all the ""it wasn't scary"" nonsense spouted by unimaginative people who don't get it, The Blair Witch Project is a great, very effective horror movie. It should probably have been released with a disclaimer: imagination is required. If you don't have one, you will find it tedious, annoying and boring. If you do, be prepared for a roller coaster.In conventional horror movies, you're constantly being shown glimpses of the villain, or monster, or evil presence, and usually by the end the evil has been revealed. The Blair Witch Project doesn't work that way. Instead, it works off the idea that the mysterious noise off in the woods is scarier than what is actually making the noise. Each night, as the characters fall asleep, the noises get closer, eerier, more menacing. You sense an evil presence closing in on them, but it's never identified. Try as they might, the characters can't find their way out of the woods. Each night, the inevitable darkness descends, and they wait, like forlorn prey, knowing that they will be targets once again for whatever wickedness stalks them in the night.The idea to shoot the film entirely with handheld cameras carried by the actors themselves is what makes this movie work. You see and experience everything from their perspective. When they get lost, you feel their anxiety, when darkness approaches, you experience their hopelessness, when they get frightened, and your body physically reacts as if the horror is in the room with you. If this movie were shot any other way, it would not be anywhere near as effective.Many negative things have been said about Heather Donahue, but I thought she did an outstanding job. She played her character perfectly. She showed more depth and emotion in this role than the vast majority of actresses out there today. She played it real too, and she wasn't afraid to be vulnerable, to appear bitchy, to have snot running down her nose, to scream her ass off when frightened beyond belief. This Heather-bashing needs to be put to rest. In many ways, she is the film. Her companions were great, because they really reflect the audience's reactions to her and the situation. Mike was a trip. His expressions and little quips provide much-needed comic relief early in the film.You really have to admire what these people did on a budget of only $35-$40,000. I've said it before, it's easy to throw millions of dollars at a project, but it takes real talent, creativity and intelligence to come up with an economical way of making it work. The fact that these people made what is arguably one of the most original and scariest horror movies of the last 20 years on a fraction of a fraction of what Hollywood spends on most movies is just amazing. The Blair Witch Project is deserving of whatever praise it gets."	4.0	Relentless Horror for Imaginative Minds	2004-02-07	14	8	6
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1NAGYEOC6ZEHW	Jason Schwab	This movie is SO SCARY, but don't worry.  There are no torn up bodies, stabbings, beatings, or impalements.  The fear factor is all in your mind's interpretation of what you see.  In many scenes, our three heros are at a lit tent surrounded by darkness.  This lets our imaginations run wild.  What can be out there?  We'll never know.  The movie starts off by making us feel like we're gonna watch a routine walk in the woods, but that couldn't be farther from the truth.  Their walking route takes them around in circles, the hike seems to take forever, they loose the map, they hear strange sounds each night, they find little packages left outside their tent made of sticks and rocks, and these things push them all to the edge.  The conclusion is horrifying, because we as viewers almost feel as they do, completely disoriented.  When we don't know what we're doing, and a witch is after us, we loose our grip.  Combine that with an interesting plot twist, and you'll walk away completely shaken.  ...	5.0	Scary, Funny, Horrifying...	2001-07-28	5	2	3
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AMAUNA0COWM9	Jason Williams	"First off...I find it amusing that so many people(mostly under the age of 25) actually believe that this movie was somehow based upon a true story. I hate to be the one to burst the bubble (not really), but not one shred of this movie has any real life parallels. Yep, it was all cooked up by the cast/crew. Just visit any number of urban legend sites on the web to verify this. Its not even based upon a local folklore legend (it was also fabricated)a facet that, if existed I believe would have made the movie a lot better.Now to the review. First off this movie, when I saw it in the theatre, made me dizzy. So much that I almost wanted to throw up. The DVD version is less traumatic. The main problem I have here is with the plot. You basically have two plot lines running simulatneously in this movie. Which one you adhere to depends upon your ability to suspend reality and to what degree. The first I will call the logical plot and it basically boils down to three stupid ... going out on a weekend hiking trip to shoot a documentary on a local ghost legend - sans any remote skills in map/compass reading or wilderness survival. The three run afoul of a rather sizable satanic cult and are picked off one by one in ritualistic fashion.The second one is the metaphysical plot line and has the basic  elements of the afforementioned plot but the antagonist is the ""Blair Witch"" a flat, inconcievable ""spirit being"" that sadistically toys with the three goofballs killing them one by one until its macabre pleasures are satisfied(when their all dead).This movie had tremendous potential, but failed on numerous fronts. First off I had no sympathy for any of the victims. I keep trying to imagine myself in the movie as a cast member when I watch this. Let me tell you that I, for one, would have helped the cult/witch out a bit when I discovered that the one screwball cast member threw away the map. At that point I would have kicked him in the nuts, bashed his head in with a rock, and left him for fodder. Also, the film would have been cut short and probably never been ""produced"" because at the point when the taller guy was pleading with the stupid girl to please stop recording their traumatic emotional dramas, hey - no negotiations. I would have wrestled the camcorder away from her and slammed it against the nearest tree.And whats with not being able to read a simple topo map with a compass? Its not that hard.1. First establish your position on the map(something they had numerous opportunity to do earlier on in the film).2. Find north with the compass, place the map on the ground with the North arrow oriented in the same direction as the compass's N arrow then ""draw"" a line from the center of the compass to where you want to go.3. Hold that bearing until you get there.Hey, I know that this was the Clinton presidency and all but I'd bet that any of the characters would have openly welcomed a ""bigot-homophobe"" Boy Scout - any of whom I know could have gotten them out of this situation in a matter of hours.I was raised in the outdoors and I know that I would have an obvious advantage over these three if placed in a similar situation, but come on, at some point in the film I was almost cheering for them to get killed because I was so disgusted with their lack of any kind of logical assessment or decisionmaking.The movie is unconvincing in that it does not provide a ""bridge"" between the two plot lines - you either follow one or the other, but are not drawn into both as it should be. An example of this would be some unexplainable ""freak' of reality such as when the cast inadvertently ends up back at the stream where they were previously ( I wont get in to how streams don't travel in circles and if you follow them(downslope)they travel towards and merge with larger streams - most of which people eventually build something by)and they are say - on the WRONG side of the stream! A friend of mine argued that this WAS the case in the film but after I watched it again - nope theyre on the side their supposed to be on - wishful thinking on his part I guess.In summation,  the fact is that there is nothing in this film that is not in some way explainable and the ""Blair Witch"" seems to be a metaphor created by the characters to describe events happening to them that are being perpetrated by unremarkable ""real world"" beings (demented people). That in itself is scary but the allusion to the supernatural is simultaneously unbelievable and distracting."	2.0	Not what it was cracked up to be	2003-07-20	3	2	1

I couldn't sleep that night, and also could not wait to get home after the movie and get on-line and tell anybody that would listen how amazing this movie was. It takes alot for me to give any movie 5 stars, but this was a no-brainer, scary and intense as hell.Alot of people complained about the film quality, saying it was too ""jumpy"", in fact, there were reports that some movie-watchers had to leave teh theater because they thought they might throw-up.........wimps, what a bunch of B.S., the cheap camera work here works, and just adds to the unsettling creepyness this movie brings you.You all know the plot, so I won't bore you with the details.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A259BN9T3MAMRC	Jay	"I enjoyed this film when it was released in the theaters, and was spooked by it even though I'd learned it was not a true story.  I later bought the VHS version, and watch it once a year in the autumn in the dark.The poor reviews of the movie on this site follow the same pattern, for the most part:  everyone who hated it expected to SEE the actual deaths or bloodshed or the witch herself.  The whole point is that the Blair Witch and what happened to the three students is supposed to be a MYSTERY.  If the film had shown some monster jumping out and devouring these people, it would have been just like other horror movies, most of which are crap, and there would have been no mystery to it.  The ""authorities"" could have said, oh, some old lady killed these kids.  Not knowing what happened is the whole point.  I understand how some people didn't like it or weren't scared, but if you could just embrace the concept--that we're not supposed to know this was a work of fiction--then you can let your imagination run wild and allow yourself to be scared.  Some of these reviews are so hostile (and some of them incoherent babbling with horrible grammar), I can only assume that the film was not violent enough for these reviewers' tastes.  And that's sad.  Some of the best parts of ""Jaws"" were when you didn't see the head of the shark, but only saw the fin and/or heard the cello music.  It was at those times that what you didn't see was what scared you the most.I understand that the film isn't for everyone, but I think many of these reviewers just didn't get it."	5.0	Excellent concept	2005-10-10	7	5	2

I think I kind of ruined it for her  because I kept laughing. Not because the acting was bad, it wasn't. Just  the whole thing was amusing. I suppose if I was in the woods and heard a  sound at 3am, I would think it was a bear and not go running after it, but  hey thats just me. I thought the ending was great, but I agree with a  previous reviewer that it was finally starting to make me feel a little  uneasy, and I was really getting into it when BAM! credits.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3M8305NLPXDSL	Jeff	Simply put, I'll never be convinced that they did not steal the entire premise of this movie from the Last Broadcast. That being said, the first time I saw the Blair Witch I admit I was caught up in the entire concept. Now I see it as a horribly flawed movie made by people who certainly don't know how to tell a story. The greatest flaw in the entire movie is simply that the movie can't exist if they turn the camera off. Unfortunatly, its hard to convince the average viewer that someone would continue filming after being stalked in the woods and losing one of your counterparts. In that situation I would have also followed the direction of the planes that you can hear flying over head through out the movie. I wouldn't buy the dvd.	1.0	It's not creative genius	2000-12-23	2	0	2

Some unseen, looming threat follows them... what is it?? A spector with with ghosts of children in tow? A cult? Some ""rednecks"" wanting to scare them?Where the film starts to lose me is the conclusion. (Spoiler)... the fleshy remnant of Josh left at the tent... not really needed. The end... with the two meeting a bizarre end in the old  ""Paar"" house...  it just feels like a ""cheat.""I  believe it would be scarier to even have one camper rescued and interviewed in some psychiatric hospital. To have all three die is just too much for me.Overall, this is a brilliant, low budget film. The ""mockumentary"" hype they built around the movie is the most briliant move of all.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3KY68OTSNHM3G	Jeffrey T. Munson	"On a chilly fall morning, three ametur filmmakers (Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard, and Michael Williams) set off in search of the Blair Witch.  The legend states that a supernatural force is haunting the woods surrounding the town of Burkittsville, Maryland.  The filmmakers believe that its the spirit of the witch.  After gathering their gear and doing some interviews with local residents, they set off into the woods to find the witch.  What happens next can only be described as several days of sheer terror.  Strange occurrances start taking place at night.  Small piles of rocks are piled outside of the tent, but no one knows where they came from. Meanwhile, Mike reveals that he threw the group's map of the woods into the creek.  Frustration and panic sets in as the group realizes they are now hopelessly lost.  Morale in the group deteriorates, hunger sets in, and fights among the group start.  At night, terror fills the darkness in the form of voices and other creepy noises.  By day, the group tries vainly to escape from their self-inflicted prison.  Ultimately, they find out that they are no longer filming a spirit, but their own struggle to survive.This is a genuinely scary movie.  It is not typical blood and gore, but psychological terror.  One critic who reviewed this movie called it ""Scary as Hell""; I agree.  Watch and see for yourself.  If you like good psychological horror, then The Blair Witch is one you won't want to miss."	4.0	Creepy and Scary	2002-09-24	1	1	0

When I went to see it in the theater, I was terrified of walking back to my car, even though my brother and one his friends were with me. That night, I not only had to keep a light on, I played the radio non-stop, because if it was too quiet, I started thinking about this movie too much, and scared myself all over again.Why did this movie scare me so much? Even today, after a few more viewings, I can't say for sure. It feels like the audience is making the journey through the woods with the characters, and after becoming familiar with them, one of them disappears suddenly, and the other two...well, who knows? And that is probably they key here: the more active your imagination, the more frightened you will ultimately be.The final sequence, of Heather chasing Mike downstairs to the basement, is the most terrifying thing I've ever seen...and I've watched a lot of horror movies. Repeat viewings of the film find me watching the last few minutes over a few times; it's so dreadful, you can't look away even though you're watching through your fingers.Opinion is sharply divided on ""Blair Witch,"" it seems: you either love it or hate it. However you feel about this movie, you do end up talking about it, and isn't leaving a lasting impression one of the goals of almost any film? In that sense, ""Blair Witch"" has certainly succeeded."	5.0	Prepare to be freaked out	2003-01-07	2	1	1

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A238LQE629J4NV	J. Kenney	This was recommended so highly to me by my younger brother, and there were so many references to it (even Target has a Blair Witch commercial now!) that I figured I had to see it just to find out what all the fuss was  about.  Before I went, I checked out the Blair Witch web site, and was very  impressed with it.  It traces the history of the witch, gives footage from  &quot;newscasts&quot; on the missing kids, and had me looking forward to a  very scary movie.  Unfortunately, the film itself is not as good as its  website. I left the movie convinced that it was made as the result of a  drunken bet at film school (&quot;No man, I'll bet you I can make people  pay me to get them ticked off AND nauseous.&quot;) Honestly, I was so sick  to my stomach during the movie that I thought I'd eaten some bad moo shu  pork, and that was just from the camera-work.  I had read that the movie  had to be re-edited to make Heather (one of the three film students) less  shrill and more likeable; I left wondering what in the world they could  have left on the editing room floor.  But it wasn't just Heather who was  annoying - all three of the main characters were self-important and much  more interested in yelling at each other than working together to get out  of the woods. All of this would be bad enough, but the movie depends on  piles of rocks and stick figures suspended from trees to do the scaring  (all I could think about was the line from Ghostbusters - &quot;You're  right, Ray - no human would stack books like this&quot;) none of which was  the least bit frightening.  Overall, I would only recommend this movie if  you just drank bathroom cleaner and need to induce vomiting.  If you want  to get a good scare (and much better acting and production values), check  out The Sixth Sense.	1.0	Avoid, Avoid, Avoid!	1999-12-08	6	4	2

This film occupies a prominent place on my list of the ten worst movies ever made.  The only thing remotely scary about it was that so many people were actually deluded into thinking it was worth the price of admission.  Lemme see now... three totally obnoxious, foul-mouth college kids traipse off into deepest Maryland (I'm cracking up just typing this) looking for signs of some kind of local witch.  They manage to lose themselves in the woods by a river, yet (did it ever occur to these bozos that if they followed the river they were sure to come to a populated area?) and are never seen again.  Don't we wish. They actually came back and made a sequel to this mishmash!  On a scale of one to five I'd give this mess a minus-ten, but the review rules say I have to give it at least one star, so I will grudgingly shell out one.

So  simplistic,it's brilliant.I was cynical about this movie for obvious  reasons,but after all the hype dies down,i have to admit that this is a  truly chilling movie that gave me nightmares.From the opening scene that  tells you it's found footage you will be seeing,to the final frame,i was  anxious and uneasy.This is guerrila filmaking at it's best,and i hope there  are more films of this sort in the future.Highly recommended if you don't  need stunning visuals,sfx,creepy music,blood and guts,and the final  showdown with the unknown evil to entertain you.A personal favorite,and  what i consider an instant classic.	5.0	A film that reflects the performers attitude at the time.	2000-08-10	2	1	1

The story seemed promising, but I soon began to become aggravated with the characters. They were so annoying that I many times wished I could punch them through the screen. I didn't really find any of the movie to be scary, or even interesting even when things were supposed to be getting more suspenseful.

Since I had purchased the soundtrack before the movie came out (GREAT 90s alt.) I knew it wasn't a for real thing- (they ""dissapeared"" in 1994, yet the ""mixed-tape"" found in Josh's car had music on it from 1995-1999 WTFThe Blair Witch Project: Josh's Blair Witch Mix [Enhanced CD]).To be to the point- this movie is a great psychological horror movie.  It plays on the monsters in your mind, instead of the transparent gore-fest that many horror movies tend to be.

Either that, or they saw it in the theaters surrounded by a bunch of screaming [people]. I personally find this movie to be the scariest I have ever seen and beyond that an awesome film with good acting and a great story. To this day I have only watched this movie three times despite the fact that I own it and love it. In fact I can still remember vividly the first time I sat and watched the movie, it was three o' clock in the morning, completely dark, completely silent, and that's the type of atmosphere needed to fully enjoy this masterpiece of horror cinema. I think that most people didn't have that atmosphere when watching it and for that reason it gets a bad rap. For those of you out there who didn't see this movie in the theaters and haven't watched it with your buddies at a party or something, you are very lucky to not have a great and very frightening movie ruined.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A11F0ECHMYDWIN	"joedriver252 ""joedriver252"""	"In a halloween episode of ""The Simpsons"", Lisa is reading Poe's ""The Raven"" to Bart.  When she gets to the part where the poet opens his door to find ""...darkness there, and nothing more...""  Bart chimes in ""You know what's scarier than nothing?...ANYTHING!!"".  My point? I wish the creators of ""The Blair Witch Project"" were Simpsons fans.  I understand the idea that ""less is more"" can work well in horror films.  Hitchcock was a master of the concept, and even mediocre monster films don't show the creature for at least the first half of the movie.  But a corollary (sp?) to ""less is more"", could be ""nothing is still nothing"", and that's just about what ""The Blair Witch Project"" offers.  To be more accurate, it's hard to care whether there is somthing out there or not after 70 minutes of 3 people walking in circles swearing at each other.  There are some nighttime scenes that approach being mildly creepy, but then the sun comes up, and the foul-mouthed wanderings begin again, with no promise of any attack by a blair witch, serial killer, or hungry cougar to end the pointless trek.  In addition to these problems, one has to remember a throwaway line of dialogue from early in the film to understand the ending, if one even cares by then.  I'm hesitant to give negative reviews, and I do give the creators of the film credit for an orginal idea, and for trying something different, but in my opinion, ""The Blair Witch Project"" just doesn't deliver the thrills and chills promised."	2.0	Doesn't Deliver the promised chills (Possible Spoilers)	2005-03-19	5	3	2

Since this movies release there has been a number of ""Found Footage Films"" out there such as Paranormal Activity and Cloverfield. Now these films aren't exact copies of The Blair Witch but they I really don't think they would have existed, at least not in the same form if this movie had never been made and marketed the way it was.The film is about three college students making a documentary film about the blair witch myth in the small town of Burkittsville Maryland. While filming though strange things begin to happen and they realize that the myth and the danger is quite real.I honestly believe that this is one the best horror films ever made because it is believable and with the marketing, which at the time of release was stating that it was a true story and this was the actual footage that was found, made it that more believable.There is a lot of negative reviews for this film it seems because people just don't understand that the filmmakers were trying something new and it really worked but just wasn't what people expect out of a movie because they were used to the beautifully shot action packed films that Hollywood seems to have an endless supply of. People seem to fear any original idea and because they don't fully understand it they put it down and discourage others from seeing it.There are certain films that I think everyone should see and The Blair Witch Project is definitely one of them."	5.0	This movie was way ahead of it's time	2011-07-21	2	2	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2HE9N3307VY3P	JoeyValentino	"People give The Blair Witch Project a hard time for supposedly not being scary, and in some cases, even boring. These people need to pay closer attention to what's actually happening on screen rather then ""watch"" the film. If you've been living under a rock since 1999, The Blair Witch Project is about 3 filmmakers who are making a documentary about The Blair Witch, a woman who supposedly haunts the town of Burketsville, Maryland. Along the way, they get lost in the woods, and we witness strange events that start to happen.Since this is the Blu-Ray version of the film, I will review specifically this version.-Picture: I'm sure a lot of people are curious about this, as you can only do so much with converting footage from a camcorder to HD. The picture is not widescreen. Rather, it is 4:3 with black bars on both sides of the picture (so it is not stretched). Though this is probably the best the movie has ever looked, it's still a dissapointment, but at the same time, it's understandable given the source material.-Sound: If you have a nice surround sound set up, this is not a movie you would want to show off to your friends. The sound is not terrible, mind you (again, given the source material), but I think we could do better then DTS 2.0 stereo.-Extras: There's actually a decent amount of extras. 4 alternate endings, deleted scenes, a 44 minute mockumentary that I beleive aired on the SciFi channel, a short 3 and a half minute Legacy of The Blair Witch short which details the history of Burketsville from the 1700's up to October 16, 1997, and of course Audo Commentary from the film's producers, which actually turns out to be pretty informative.Overall, if you own this on DVD, I wouldn't see a reason to pick this up, unless you absolutely must. The extras are neat, and, depending where you buy it, a $10 price tag isn't bad. I just wish they would release a Special Edition of the movie with the stuff the film's producers said they cut out. Maybe when the real sequel comes out, we'll get such a thing."	4.0	11 years later, still creepy as hell.	2010-08-31	13	11	2

This movie was hyped as the greatest scare flick in years, but it did not  live up to its hype.The way this movie was shot is not new (see &quot;84  Charlie MoPic,&quot; &quot;Cannibal Holocaust,&quot; and the UPN docudrama  about a Minnesota family captured by aliens from about two years ago).  Like the UPN program, it struck me as odd that these three people, who are  lost in the woods and in what appears to be grave danger, had the presence  of mind to film and videotape everything.  Even combat photographers will  stop filming if they are in mortal danger.  When they went into the house  at the end, a camera would have been the last thing I would have  brought.The movie spent too much time showing the three  &quot;students&quot; walking around in the woods and screaming the f-word  more times than a gangsta rap CD.  I was tempted to fast-forward through  most of it.The ending (or lack of one) left a lot to be desired.  I have  one theory.  It was Josh.  The Blair Witch possessed Josh, made him call  Mike and Heather into the house, and he did them in.  What he did with them  and what happened to him is another matter.In all, it was a good  premise, but could have been better written and produced.

All I found was a story with incredible potential, completetly ruined by  characters who lack: 1)intelligence (follow the stream, stupid!) 2)real  human characteristics in moments of extreme fear (who keeps filming when  being hunted down by a witch?) 3)a vocabulary (swearing in almost every  sentence) 4)strength (what a bunch of little whiners they are!)Do not  buy this movie, unless you need to see for yourself how bad a movie can be  and still get a good review, just because it has a reputation of being  produced by people not part of the &quot;Hollywood Establishment&quot;.	1.0	poorly thought out - a very bad movie	2000-02-05	9	6	3

That doesn't mean it is any good. I bought it because I enjoy suspenseful movies, believed the hype, and I can now say I have learned by the experience!  It is SO slow, SO tedious and the dialog demonstrates the value of having a good script-writer by its banality.  It does create a certain tension, but my recommendation is rent this when you have REALLY reached the bottom of the barrel.

It was made for next to nothing and still manages to be the type of horror movie that we haven't seen for many, many years.  For those people who want Freddie Kruger and  Aliens type special effects, it's bound to be a disappointment - that's the  whole point!  It's not an in your face horror movie - Freddie and Aliens  were just plain silly. This movie is terrifying precisely because the  horror is so underplayed - the final two seconds will stay with me forever.  It is a thriller/horror in the tradition of &quot;Psycho&quot; and  &quot;Full Circle&quot; (&quot;The Haunting of Julia&quot; in the USA);  particularly effective because it DOESN'T rely on special effects, a huge  budget and big name actors.Seems to me an awful lot of people have  missed the point completely with this one.	4.0	Think about it!	2000-02-11	6	2	4

That's all I'll ask.Anyway, I started this in the evening while the film was nice and light-hearted and as the film progressed into it's dark, horiffic nature it got dark outside my house which kind of freaked me out.  Anyway, it was really entertaining, very well executed, and pretty creepy.  The whole idea is really cool I think.  I'm surprised people actually thought it was real, but oh well.

What is missing, however, is the fact that you have to pay attention to all of the subtle hints and dialog setups in the beginning to fully appreciate  the mastery of this film.  Like any true horror film, it uses all of the  basic elements that naturally inspire fear in all of us.  I had more  full-body goosebumps and shivers during this movie than any other  &quot;horror&quot; movie I have ever seen.  I still have goosebumps when I  think about many of the scenes.  At the beginning of the movie, I thought  that I'd like to visit those beautiful woods that the characters set out  in.  After the movie, I was seriously considering cutting down the three  trees in my backyard!  If you buy this movie, make sure that you are not  interupted in the beginning or you'll miss some key dialog that sets up the  rest of the movie.	5.0	True horror begins in the mind.	1999-12-03	9	6	3

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A22BPC7LRSGSYQ	Joker	"This ""movie"" is a ""documentary"" about the so-called Blair witch legend.  It was marketed and hyped up as a true story, that three teenagers went into the woods in search of the Blair witch in October 1994 and never returned.  Then their camcorder footage was found a year later.The whole idea behind this movie was to scare its audience with the concept of making the audience get frightened of things they don't see.  It's called psychological horror.  Other horror movies of the past have accomplished this goal.  The Haunting (1963) is a perfect example.  The Haunting was a professionally made movie with a musical score, the whole nine yards.  In contrast, The Blair Witch Project was filmed with a camcorder and a shakey one at that.  There is no music in the film.  It's raw.  It has a skeletal budget.  It has the sounds of the day and the sounds of the night and the sounds of profane teenagers.  It's basically a ""reality"" film about some teens who are lost in the woods in search of a legendary witch that supposedly lives there.  The fact that they're looking for a witch and lost at the same time makes them increasingly frightened and frustrated as the movie progresses.The main problem I have with this film is that the footage is so shakey and amateur-ish.  This movie is unwatchable.  It'll make you dizzy and give you a headache.  It's fine to use a camcorder.  I thought it was a unique way to film a documentary ""movie"".  But at least make the footage watchable.  I can understand the camera shaking at times when the kids are running away from something that's scaring them, but to have shakey footage when they're just sitting around and talking or when planning their trip is really inexcusable.  If I want to watch really bad and I mean REALLY bad and shakey camcorder footage, I can watch any one of the countless lame and shakey videos that people I know have made throughout the years.  I don't know what's so hard about keeping a steady camera.  This film would have been better if the camerawork was better.  Instead of feeling scared, I found myself being distracted by the terrible camerawork and feeling dizzy with a headache, also.  The bad camerawork robbed me of any scared feeling I was supposed to have when watching this film.I think that if everyone who saw this film in 1999 would have known from the beginning that this film's story was not true, it wouldn't have drawn the crowds that it did.  There was a brilliant marketing campaign for this film and it worked.  Normally I'd give this film 1 star, but I'm adding an additional star for its unique approach and the fact that the marketing ploy made the makers of this film $ millions.  Again, it would be a better film had the camerawork been better."	2.0	There's nothing worse than shakey camcorder footage	2010-03-17	5	2	3

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A33CLVW2K7SL1P	Jonathan Appleseed	"I had an interesting and fairly unique experience with this film. Bear with me through a little background explanation so that you'll understand.I'm hard of hearing, with no hearing in my right ear at all, and only 25% in my left. If you've ever seen someone in the theaters wearing headsets, that's someone like me. I wear headsets because although I have a hearing aid that works very well in normal situations, it doesn't help in movies. The headsets are specialized to assist with the comprehension of dialogue. Without them, I would be absolutely lost. The number of films I misunderstood, or had new meaning added once I watched them on video with closed captioning (Angel Heart is one) are legion. The Blair Witch Project falls into that category.In the theater, I had a very difficult time understanding the dialogue in the ""interviews"". The sound quality throughout the movie is generally poor, and that's intentional, as it's supposed to be a very cheap documentary. This means that I missed out on some pretty important explanations of the serial killer of children and the Blair Witch herself, and didn't realize that they were separate entities. Also, once things started going south (no pun intended) in the woods, I hadn't the slightest idea what was going on. I didn't hear any twigs snapping at night outside their tent, cackling, and I certainly didn't hear any children's voices as the tent was being pummeled, the scene which led Heather to run away from the tent and after something that she saw. So when the final scene arrived, this magnificent denouement that the Amazon description speaks of, I was completely lost. I left the theater thinking that this was the stupidest piece of garbage I had ever seen.Months later, when it came out on video, I decided to give it another shot thinking that perhaps I had missed something. And when I got the closed captions going, I found out that I did. I learned that there was 1) the Blair Witch, and 2) the serial killer of children. I heard snapping at night outside the tent and realized that there were children's voices haunting them at night - all of the things I missed in the film due partly to my hearing problem, but mostly to the poor sound quality. This time, even though I knew the ending, the denouement terrified me. I'm not easily frightened, and when I turned the lights off that night, there was a good ten minutes of discomfort before I finally fell asleep. That feeling stayed with me for several weeks.Of course I immediately rented The Curse of the Blair Witch. Most people I talk to that hated the movie (and they are numerous) felt so because they didn't really understand what was going on, and the ending, therefore, meant nothing to them. In The Curse of the Blair Witch, we learn much more about the actual witch and the serial killer, who claimed to have been haunted by the witch, and blamed her haunting of him for his murders. At first I thought this additional information was ""cool"", but as I thought on it I realized that many people I had discussed the film with didn't like it because they didn't understand the ending. ""Mike's in the corner? Big deal! What does that have to do with the Blair Witch?"" Well, as we learn, it has everything to do with it. And this information should have been in the film, not in a mockumentary. Leaving out this information changes the movie from 5 stars to 4.Never cheat your audience."	4.0	Slightly cheated	2004-09-12	6	2	4
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AXYEW4EJR2BIA	"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com"""	"The Blair Witch Project is a found-footage horror movie about a group of filmmakers that enter the woods to document the haunting legend of the Blair Witch. The Blair Witch Project is a film that will scare you if you let your imagination run wild...I really enjoyed the intro where they speak to the locals about the Blair Witch; the tales are creepy and effective, and they feel authentic. Now, the group enter the woods and eventually get lost. This is the scariest part of the film for me; imagine getting lost in the woods that are supposed to be haunted and having your mind play tricks on you; it's truly a chilling concept. You don't actually see anything in this film, but you hear the screams of the actors. This is where it may be a problem; if your not immersed into the film, you may not be able to effectively use your imagination. The film doesn't have much tension, either, so it may not immerse you at all. Another flaw in my opinion was Heather; her character is the illogical one that causes this whole situation by going into the woods pretending to know where they were you going, and she constantly tries to joke around which kills the mood/atmosphere especially when she wasn't really funny. If they balanced her dialogue (espescially her fooling around) and decisions, this would've been a lot better. Other illogical decisions would be (slight spoiler) purposely throwing the map into a river. The ending was redeeming for her character, Heather, and for the movie in general, though. The acting was all fine, including Heather's. Not much happens in this 1hr 20min film though.Overall, the ""lost in the woods"" concept is scary, and the ending was great, but not much happens to really scare you throughout.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1V80WQV2L32QJ	Jon Atwood	The main problem with the Blair Witch Project is that the whole movie is spent building up to something, and then nothing happens. It's a shame, too, because I thought that the road to the climax was, for the most part,  built up skilfully, if not very scary. The ending makes us feel like there  was more to the story, making us want to see an extended version, which, of  course, is not given to us. There were other flaws to this movie, but it  was this poorly thought ending that slid my rating down the most.  More so,  I wasn't very convinced at the ending. We see them get knocked on the head.  that could have been anyone. It could have beena hill billy trying to make  mischife, or something. We should see something profound happen to them, so  we know that it is the work of the blair witch. All this movie needs to  make it a masterful thriller is if the ending were better contrived.  The  rising action in this film had its goods and bads. First the goods. This  movie succedes at keeping the audience watching, wanting to know what will  happen. Also, I liked how  it kept building up with a bit of evidence that  there is in fact something out there, watching them. First with the tents  rattling, then with a pile of rocks being formed outside their tents, and  finally, with the stick figures that are made into witches. At that point,  I was completely aware of the witches existence, and because of that,  having the witch herself appear is unnessecary, which creates even more  suspense.  Now to the flaws. There were a couple of parts that could have  and would have been solved emidiatly if something irrational hadn't  happened. For example, when they were trying to find there way back, one of  the guys procedes to throw the map awy, claiming it wasn't doing them any  good. So I guess he thought they would be better off without the map,  without anything to help guide them I bet if he keeps the map, they can  find their way back to their car, and the movie ends there.  The other time  is when they are in their tents at night, and something, presumably the  blair witch, chases them, and they get away. How can you get away like that  when a supernatural creature is chasing you? Why didn't the blair witch  just kill them then, thus ending the movie? Of course, they have to find  some way to continue the movie, but a truely great movie would have found a  way to overcome that believably. This one doesn't.  These problems not with  standing, I have to give credit to the acting in the Blair Witch Project.  The three teens preforming as the victims acted very well, combining fear  and hoplessnes with anger and frustration, knowing they are just decending  deeper into the graspe of the blair witch, having no idea how to get out of  it. If I were in that situation in real life, I naturally would have felt  and acted the same.  Because of all the hype that it has gotten, I won't be  suprised if the Blair Witch Project gets nominated for best picture. I  happen to think it isn't quite a good enough movie to step on such a high  platform.	2.0	Good, but a bit overrated	2000-01-22	2	1	1

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AN55VVQSWHGCA	Jon Bjorling	The Blair Witch Project is a reminder that Indepentant film is far superior to main stream film.  This is a film with no scripts, not real actors, and no cheap props.  Three college students are lost in the woods  shooting a documentary about the Blair Witch.  Everything that we can see  comes from the lense of their two cameras.  We never see anything exept  that.  And that is the beauty of the film, it' simplicity.  This is a film  that works so well, and can never be duplicated successfully.  The best  part of this film is that the reactions the actors display are real.  This  film is impovisation, like I said, NO SCRIPTS.  The actors are really in  the woods, and are being terrorized by the director and his crew.  The DVD  features are excellent.  The commentary is excellent, as is the documentary  that is included.  This is an excellent film that sadly, you will either  like or hate.

Albee ""Faulkner Wannabe"""	"Yes, this is a well-done mockumentary horror film, and it will scare the squirt out of you.But here are a few things potential viewers may want to know before they watch:The entire thing, from the plot itself, to the back-story, the mythology and the locations (except Burkittsville) are entirely fictional.  There's no such person as Elly Kedward.  There was no such person as Rustin Parr.  There was absolutely NO settlement known as ""Blair"" prior to the founding of Burkittsville in 1824.  The crimes described as inspiration for the film are a fictional back-story.  They never happened.  The web sites claiming to represent the ""facts"" are also fictional.  So, except in your mind, there's no Blair Witch.  That doesn't mean the film is a failure.  In fact, it has most of the viewing public convinced that it's true, and despite your opinion on this matter, it's hard to deny that the story makes you think, and scares you.The film is short (runs about 80 minutes), and is shot almost entirely in two or three locations.  The final edit is intended to mimic a documentary, so the photography is grainy and shaky.  The entire film runs in a 4:3 window WITHIN the normal 4:3 screen to enhance the amateur documentary effect.What the film lacks in gore (there's essentially no blood at all) it more than makes up for in foul language.  The screenplay is designed to give you the impression that the film is being made by three foul-mouthed, grunge-soaked college students, so the swearing is WAY over the top.It's a good scare, but nothing profound."	4.0	Scary as hell, yes, but ENTIRELY fictional	2012-02-24	1	1	0

I believe that had the film not entered  the mainstream, it might have been better served.  For example, say the  average horror fan found this film at their video store and knew NOTHING  about it.  My guess is that they would have been sufficiently creeped out  and a cult (as opposed to a summer smash) would have been born.By the  time I saw Blair Witch Project, the conceit was so well-publicized and  undermined (&quot;it's not really real&quot;), that the real fun of the  movie was robbed.  If you could watch this film without being entirely sure  whether or not you were watching actual footage, the impact would be  drastically increased.  Unfortunately, I was not afforded that chance and I  watched it on its own merits.Surprisingly, I was still pulled in.  Yes -  I was periodically restless at the repetitive elements.  Yes - the camera  shaking grew tiresome.  Still...the last ten minutes grabbed me.  The final  image kind of disturbed me.  Then I went back and watched the last sequence  again and it REALLY disturbed me.  In fact, I can't get it out of my head  in the week since I watched it.I'm of the opinion that this movie  essentially functions as a campfire tale.  There is a set-up, a long  build-up, and a cold-blooded punchline.  If you heard the story around a  campfire in the woods, the teller of the tale would likely add the  traditional scary oomph by assuring you that &quot;it REALLY  happened&quot;.You wouldn't believe that part of course.  But after  lights out, as you lay in your tent ... you'd wonder and you'd  worry.That's what I think the filmmakers had in mind -and they got me.	4.0	Can't get the final image out of my head	1999-10-28	7	6	1

The Blair Witch Project is terrifying. It prods at our fear of the unknown. We see three kids go into the woods,  we know that they will never return. They are stalked by the menacing Blair  Witch, and its really scary. The ending is wonderful. I was afraid when I  first saw it that we were going to see the BW or have an answer to one of  the many mysteries that this film poses. Thank God. The movie ends in  mystery, with the two remaining students being killed. Only the footage  remains to testify to their final, terryfying days in the woods. What  happened to the students? Hopefully that question will never be answered. A  movie sequel is uneccessary, the book, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT DOSSIER,  covers the investigation, and makes a terrific continuation of the movie.  It also leaves unanswered questions. Beware of the Blair Witch. She's very  scary.	4.0	The Blair Witch Project	1999-12-19	2	2	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A22HA2PPQBJZ5X	Josh Murray	Yeah, that is basically Hollow Man's Tagline, but really, that is what the  Blair Witch Project stands for. The real scary parts of the movie are  because you can't see the witch, and the black and white woods scenes are  also very scary. Now, I am not a 90's teen that likes movies like Scream or  I Know What You Did Last Summer, I like the old fashioned ones, like the  Romero Trilogy, Friday the 13th, Dracula, Frankenstein, etc.... The fact of  the matter is, if you thought Scream was a scary movie, and didn't catch  any of the above, you probably aren't going to like this movie. This is a  movie for the REAL horror fan. It is thrilling but only if you want it to  be, and keep in mind it was made with $40,000, so there is no possible way  you could expect more. This is more like the horror movies of old, and  let's just hope the sequel stays the same.	5.0	What you can't see will frighten you...	2000-09-04	2	1	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A34D06JL7LC6MU	"Joshua Miller ""Josh"""	"You all know about ""The Blair Witch Project"", if you've never seen it than you've seen countless parodies of it and you've heard that it's ""Scary as Hell""and ""One of the Creepiest Films Since The Exorcist"". I'm not big on scary, most movies don't creep me out or disturb me anymore. I watch horror films because they can be entertaining...Or can at least be able to jolt you. This film somehow manages to be entertaining and not scary, but disturbing. I didn't find this movie disturbing however until the final scene where the remaining characters meet their end at the hands of an unseen killer. This part, although brief and with a complete lack of information, was slightly disturbing. It makes you think. But, anyways, as far as I know...The whole Blair Witch thing is a true myth, but this movie is not real. Although it's kind of billed as a true story. You know the whole ""In October of 1994, three studen filmmakers disappeared...Etc."" I think this works and the way the film is shot, which means completely with a handheld camera which gives it a look of realism is good. The movie is about three student filmmakers namedHeather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams (which, to help with realism, is the actors real names) go into the woods of Burkittsville, Maryland to investigate the legend of The Blair Witch. Once they get into the woods, tempers flare and they eventually get lost. But weird stuff begins to happen, while they sleep something is outside the tent and ritualistic figures are found outside...Piles of rocks used at a burial ground, the stickman things in the trees. Bunch of weird crap. Anyway, as the story moves along, they realize that they will not make it out alive and just by reading the synopsis on the back, that should be obvious. I'm not sure how this movie turned out to be good, when the real payoff isn't until the last 30 seconds of the film. That means over 70 minutes of movie is pacing, but the characters and dialouge seem so real I'm inclined to think it's improved. The way the characters talk is almost exactly how people talk in real life; stuttering, repeating themselves, getting agitated, etc. Anyway, if it's Friday and you want to rent a horror movie that has a lot of blood and violence. This movie isn't for you. But, if you want a semi-effective movie that uses the unseen and the unheard to disturb you, you should like this. Any person who has an appreciation for film, since this movie was pretty original in the ways of filming and such at the time, should see this as well.GRADE: A-"	5.0	The End is the Most Disturbing, But Not the Scariest Movie Ever...	2006-05-11	18	16	2

Much like TITANIC, the hype that buzzed around this film turned a lot of people off and we can blame the media for turning this film into a ""monster"", drawing millions of people to see it when it was never intended to be a mainstream movie that would draw the kind of attention/criticism that it did. If this film had never been released in mainstream theatres or had been made 30 years ago, it would be a classic, beloved gem by devout horror fans. But because everyone expects 20 million dollar mega blockbuster films with special effects up the wazoo, this film got a really bad reputation as being low-budget, boring crap. Unfortunately, unless you are a real horror fan who CRAVES the filmmaking style of the 1970s and DESPISES the corporate Hollywood tradition of big budget blow-you-out-of-your-seat special effects, the beauty of Blair Witch will be lost on you. This film REQUIRES you to use your own imagination, forcing you to delve into the nightmarish corners of your own mind to provide you with scares beyond what any hockey-masked machete-weilding psycho could ever provide for you. You will see almost nothing, you will hear just as little, but if you're in the mindset of letting suggestion take you farther into the depths of fright than your eye or your ear every could, you will understand this movie. If you dismiss this movie and say nothing happens, you see nothing, I'm not going to get scared at the sound of rustling leaves, then your imagination and mind have been impaired and corrupted by the Hollywood big boys who think bigger is better and have to knock the audiences over in the head with a hammer to get their butts in the seats."	4.0	Don't let this gem be lost on you	2005-10-08	6	4	2

And the ""messages"" left by the witch are confusing in that you don't know what the hell they are.  All you know is something is really horribly going wrong.

When I left the theater, I just couldn't believe a Indy film could be so real. Most Indy films today have little to offer (exception of probably five films per year) to their small audiences. This film is diffrent. You hear all the talk from fans (and most critics) that 'The Exorcist' is &quot;the scarriest film ever.&quot; I disagree. Now I'm not saying that this film is the greatest horror film of all time, but it's damn close. The film is simple. Three college students go out in the woods of Burkittsville, MD to search for the legendary &quot;Blair Witch.&quot; They wind up getting lost in the woods and soon after find themselves becoming part of the legend. To make it even more simplistic, they let the two actors and actress carry around a regular camera. The results? A scary as hell picture. So simple yet so effective. The highest grossing Indy film of all time, and with good reason. Most critics loved the film, but probably half of the moviegoers came out saying &quot;this is scary?&quot; I guess everyone has their own tastes, but for me, it doesn't get much better than this. And yes this is coming from a fan of such slasher franchises as 'Friday the 13th' and 'Halloween'.

Blair Witch Project is an irritating and laughable attempt, using the title  &quot;independent film&quot; to mask and excuse the rotten acting and  tortureous camera work. Whatever sense of fear and suspense that Blair  Witch struggles to raise is rapidly struck down by the out of control  wailings of an actress who should really keep her mouth shut. As well,  where grainy black and white could have been utilized to enhance the mood  of the film, the makers of Blair Witch choose instead to slap the viewer  with shakey camera work. So much could have been done to make this movie  good, starting with better script development and ending with aesthetic  sensibility.	1.0	Cinematic Tripe!	2000-07-11	8	3	5

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2807NFYF3UINK	Justin =)	The Blair Witch Project was a film that everyone &quot;had&quot; to see this summer. The trailers drew people in, the concept was unique, and the hype was contagious. Now, only two months later the movie has come out to  buy on video and DVD.  Unfortunately, the only thing scary about this  film is that I almost paid $7 to see it in the theater. What sickened me  more was that this film has racked in so much money.  Here's the  concept. Three college students and ambiguous film makers, Heather Donahue,  Micheal Williams, and Josh Leonard, decide to make a documentary on the  legendary Blair Witch. Armed with two cameras, some other technical  equipment, and supplies to last a few days, they head out into the woods to  film. Somehow, they get lost, and that's when the terror begins. Not bad at  all, right?  Well, maybe, had the execution of this concept been put  into effect. Instead, what we see is a bunch of teens who get lost and who  have no idea how to survive in the forest in the first place. They curse  for ten minutes, yell at each other, curse for another ten minutes, and  then run around in circles cursing. Then they run away from something  &quot;evil&quot; and cry. Doesn't sound incredibly scary, does it?  Occasionally, some elements are thrown in to remind the viewer that this is  indeed a horror movie. The teens hear eerie sounds at three in the morning,  find a bunch of rocks (you will have to see the movie to understand this)  outside their tent, and have slime on their gear. One member of the party  is missing one morning and the other two hear him yelling at night.  Although these are all scary things, they don't add to the overall pictures  of what this movie is supposed to be about.  I'll give the film  credit, the last 20 minutes generate good chills, and the final scene will  leave you visibly shaken. However, this scare is only good if you managed  to stay awake for the other 80 or so minutes. Overall, I can't say it's  terrible but it's not something I'm going to watch again and again.	2.0	Blair Witch Doesn't Deliver	2000-01-01	2	2	0

I saw that I had added it to my worst movies ever made listmania list, and yet had not properly denigrated it in the form of an actual review.This is probably one of the three worst movies ever made. It's entire trick relies on you the viewer being a complete idiot. I actually knew some people that thought this might be a true story. Nevermind that the film in the camera, stuck in the basement of a ruined house in the middle of the woods probably wouldn't survive a whole year without getting ruined. I encouraged these people to go out into the woods themselves till something out there killed them too. Which brings me to my point. All I wanted was for the girl in this movie to die. She does by the way, but you have to wait a very long time for it to happen, and by then its pretty much not worth it. If I had been in this movie it would have been about 20 minutes long, and would have ended much more brutally than it did.

There are no special effects, very little blood and no gore.  The menace is never directly shown, just hinted at with increasing intensity as the film unfolds.  There is good reliance on proper setting (dark, gray days in the fall/winter, deep in the woods), sympathetic characters (tho they could have been more likeable), and, above all, a fine progression in the minds of the characters from casual enthusiasm for the project to absolute dread.  The climactic scene in the old house was chilling, esp. the final few seconds.  This is a thinking person's horror movie, unlike the abysmal sequel.

However, all of the ballyhoo cannot obscure the fact that this is one of the best horror films to come down the  pike in a VERY long time.  It is a refreshing return to the subtler horrors  of years gone by(you know, back before advances in digital technology  killed our imaginations).  People accustomed to having everything spelled  out for them will be sorely disappointed.  You are left to sort it all out  by yourself.  That is this film's great strength.  We are only given clues  and fleeting glances of the whole picture.

Turns out we all missed little  things, that when revealed made the hair on our arms stand on end.  I liken  this film to the original &quot;Haunting&quot;.  Starring Julie Harris and  made in the early 60's it's a bit dated, but frightening still.  It too was  not a big budget special fx extravaganza and you never see the ghosts,  which made it all the more scary.  How can you not be afraid of the things  that you don't see?

People say you either love or hate this film but as far as I can  see it's not interesting enough to warrant either feeling from me. I was  interested to watch it because a few people commented that the main girl  was an ugly version of myself with a slightly similar, though distinctly  nasal, voice. This elicited the only horror in me as I came to worry  whether I really sound that bad. I think it may have been exacerbated by  her American accent. So I did not see the b-grade ending but almost every  other person who has seen it tells me it ends abruptly and you never feel  scared for the characters since they're not developed enough for you to  care about them. Another comment a friend (who is a film student) made was  that film students would never handle a camera so badly. These students  would have failed their little assignment based on their complete lack of  cinemagraphic knowledge. Since this film isn't even interesting enough to  appall me, I don't think it deserves the distinction of only one star, so  I'm giving it a very ordinary two.	2.0	I don't really sound like that, do I?	1999-12-26	1	0	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A26IVZIL0934Y2	kcbranaghsgirl	My nearest and dearest may have suspected this for some time, but I'll own up to it in writing here: I use movies and peoples' opinons of them to draw quick character sketches of said people and, in extreme cases, to decide whether or not I even like them. I use The Blair Witch Project in a very specific application: whether or not somebody liked, loved or was frightened by this film gives me a good idea of whether or not that person possesses any imagination at all. If you begin watching this film with the expectation that it will figuratively take you by the hand and lead you step-by-step through a house of horrors, your experience with this film will surely disappoint you. That's not the way this one works.Many people - at least those with active imaginations - understand that the fear of the unknown we can summon in ourselves exceeds the fear generated by that which we can see. Yes, you're going to have to do a little mental work if you want to extract all the psychological terror you can from this movie. The film doesn't portray anything in graphic detail but if you'll put forth a bit of effort, TBWP will give you more than enough tools to frighten the bejesus out of yourself. You will succeed in doing so if you have sufficient imagination to conjure the images of horror that the film will not spoon-feed to you.No, this film is not for everyone. If you want to see a movie that doesn't require you to think, that spells everything out for you in big, bold and obvious letters, I strongly suggest that you don't waste your time here. But if you're willing to allow this film to actively engage your mind and to mentally supply what the film doesn't give you visually, I think you'll find this a very rewarding experience.	5.0	A cinematic litmus test	2001-08-18	0	0	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AMDFWRM2WWSCL	Keith MacIntyre (docholliday84@hotmail.com)	In a word...WOW! This movie is easily one of the best of the year, and possibly one of the best in its genre for all-time. It may, however,  present problems for some people. I have seen negative reviews (of the  movie) and negative reviews (about the people that do not like this film.)  The vast majority of people that did not like BWP seem to complain that the  movie was just not scary enough, or did not understand the hype around it.  Some of the people that did enjoy the film seem to take personal offense  that others could not take the same experience away from BWP that they did,  and just cannot figure out why anyone would not find it to be scary. The  blame with not finding the fear involved in the film lies not with the  people who saw the movie and could not get scared, but rather with  hollywood. As special effects have progressed, the ability to create more  life-like monsters have also. Every creature created as of late has become  so realistic that even the once necessary &quot;spooky shadows&quot; that  would have helped hide the creatures (see Alien/ Aliens), leaving some  detail to our imagination (and also hiding imperfections in what was the  current technology.) Nowadays, the monsters can be shown in full daylight  (see The Mummy) without worry. See what I'm getting at? Imagination. What  was once an intrical part of the genre has become unnecessary to the point  that when a movie forces us to use it, we become disappointed. Like a good  horror novel, if you were to ask 100 different people to describe the  monster (or witch, in this case) you very well may end up with 100  different opinions. This is a great movie (a modern masterpiece?) not only  because of the imagination issue, but also because of the characterization  and the use of a first person perspective throughout the film. You feel for  the characters because their relationships amongst one another is real.  (The actors were left out in the woods depending on each other with very  little direction from the directors.) You can feel their terror, because  when they were scared, they were scared. (The &quot;attacks&quot; and the  &quot;surprises&quot; were set up when they were unaware.) The use of the  first person perspective really adds to bringing you in and making you a  part of their experience rather than using typical Hollywood camera angles  that would allow you to see what was coming before the actors got hit with  it. And though the movie was not flawless, (ie: follow the river) not many  movies are. (You can generally find more things wrong with other films than  you can here.)  A word to the wise: read all you can about the making of  the film, watch the bonus featurette on the dvd (originally aired on Sci-Fi  Channel) and visit the website. It adds to the movie and the overall  experience. When you sit down to watch this movie, do it late at night,  turn off the lights, and most importantly, watch it when you have nothing  else on your mind. In order to fully enjoy the BWP, you need to allow  yourself to be sucked in and be a part of it.  So sit back, try to relax,  and be prepared to be genuinely scared for the first time in a long time.	5.0	Proving that IL&amp;M does not make the movie	1999-10-27	0	0	0

When I first heard of the concept of this movie, I was expecting it to look really cheap upon viewing.  It really didn't  come across that way at all.  It was well put together, even though some of  the zigzag camera angles and the periodic blackouts were at times annoying,  but I guess it was all for effect.  What I really didn't care for was the  storyline.  What started out to be kind of interesting ended up becoming  redundant in the middle of the movie:  characters get lost, characters  argue with each other, characters set up tent, characters get spooked at  night, characters wake up and start arguing again, characters set up  tent...you get my drift.  It wasn't until the latter part of the film where  it became unsettling.  I thought the ending was disturbing, but by the time  I got spooked, I was left hanging for more.  Even though the movie was  about 87 minutes, it seemed to last a lot longer because of the dragging  storyline.  I guess it was all the hype that left me disappointed.  Great  concept for a movie, though I hope this is not the direction Hollywood  wants to go now because of the success of this film.	3.0	Somewhat hyped	2000-03-31	0	0	0

Now, if you ever go for a walk in the woods you also need to watch out for witches like the blair witch. you wont see them at first cause they'll be hidden but then they will make scary noises and pound on your tent in the middle of the night while you're asleep. mom says that if that happens you need to leave the woods immediately. you see, thats what happened to those people in the movie amazon. they realised something was wrong but decided to keep going with their witch investigation anyway. mom says that was a bad idea. Also, if you see some weird wooden shapes made of branches in the trees then you need to run away real fast. mom says they are NOT bird houses! Also Make sure you always have a good compass, some food and a good cellphone. Kleenex and toilet paper may also be very handy, that way if you decide to shoot something with your camera then you wont have a runny nose. mom says that a runny nose in a wood full of witches in the middle of the night can really ruin your day.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"How in the world can people consider this to be one of the scariest movies of all time?  There are tons of other films that rely on the viewer using their imagination to move a story along that are so much better than this.  ""Signs"" never gives you a visual of the alien until well into the movie, but it works on your mind.  ""The Others"" has more twists and turns in it without special effects than ""The Blair Witch Project"" could muster in a film and a mockumentary.What I saw after viewing this film was something all too common in my Mass Communication classes in college:  hokey college-aged artsters hoping to make the next ""greatest film of all time"" and winding up with a silly, boring, and downright dumb film.  There is nothing scary about this film.  Sight-gags(like the stickmen totem thingies) and noises only go so far in a bad horror flick such as this one, and the whole ""recovered video tape"" idea is nothing groundbreaking.Oh, and before anybody accuses me of being one of those folks who consider a scary movie to be one of those flicks that has the most gore or special effects, you're wrong.  Those movies are pure popcorn fluff.  They don't come after you in an attempt to be scary.  They know they aren't scary, just full of eye-candy.  They ENTERTAIN the viewer.  ""Blair Witch"" lovers don't seem to be able to grasp that concept.The really scary thing about this movie is how it suckered so many people into believing that it is the greatest movie around.  That's the real masterpiece of this pile of dog poo.  The producers knew that they didn't have a winner on their hands, so they concocted a whole history for this flick and plopped it onto the internet where folks ate it up like candy.  For that reason alone, I'm giving this one two stars.  It shows just how gullible people can be.  If you keep repeating something, it's bound to become true.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3SG59KJLAQOPG	K. Good	"I'll give Blair Witch credit for approaching the horror film genre with a much more subtle and minimalistic hand than other recent monstrosities like the remake of ""The Haunting.""  The film makers tried to convey terror in the way we most get terrified, with unclear and dimly understood phenomena that subtly take us to a slightly scrambled and foreboding frame of reference, with a menacing force we feel is out to get us but which we cannot clearly define. No 20-foot high apparations growling at us, no human bones exploding out of the fireplace.So Blair Witch tries to make you think this could really happen to people, since it was ""filmed as someone's project"" (as the pre-release hype led us to believe).  But somehow, it all just falls flat.  For me there were two key problems, one of which was the believability of the presumed realism.  For example, we have this group of obviously inexpert hikers with a questionable sense of direction, taking a trip into very unfamiliar territory (territory which is purported to have claimed human lives before), with absolutely no contingency in case they get lost.  One stinking map.... no cheap Radio Shack GPS unit, and for crying out loud, in a world where young people possess cell phones in abundance, no one thought to bring one!  ""Hello... we are WAY lost here, and something's trying to kill us.... SEND HELP!""OK, if I accept that they are just a bunch of young foul-ups, am I to accept that they have to get so irrational and out of control that they spend half the film screaming and cursing at one another (yeah, I know, ""the witch"" was influencing them) that they not only failed to stick to any coherent plan to get them out of the woods, one of them actually throws that one map away out of spite?Somehow, with their brain-dead approach to what they were trying to do, and the incessant carping and yelling at each other, I just couldn't connect with any of them.  In fact, I found them to become so annoying I was waiting with hopeful anticipation to seeing ""the witch"" deal them their just desserts!Yes, it's clear the film was done VERY cheaply, and the acting is, IMO, amateurish.  It was an idea with promise, but wasn't well developed.

It has to do more with emotions, and what makes people do what they do.  It forces  you to examine what you would do in the same situation.  There aren't any  big special effects and no set script.  This is more emotional terror.  You  see these kids pushed to the brink of insanity.  You see what happens  between them.  How the emotional strain of what is going on around them is  going to affect their personal relationships, and their behavior. And, if  you are just in it for the sheer entertainment, you won't be dissapointed.  This is one terrifying movie.  I mean, when I was watching it, it's like,  wow, this could be me and my friends.  That makes it all that scarier.  It  seems so real.  I highly reccommend it!	5.0	More emotional terror than visual.  That's why it's unique.	1999-09-13	0	0	0

I know people will say the Last Broadcast was before this but it has a totally different plot.  The Marketing for this film was incredible.  I will say this as well, it took me awhile to see this film in the theaters because it was always sold out for some time.  Like there will never be another star wars a film that stayed in the Roxy theater in downtown Tacoma for two years, there will probably never be another blair witch project or movie that will be sold out for weeks at a time.  Not even the matrix did what blair witch did; maybe that is because Matrix (great movie in itself) was a copy of a far better film, Dark City.  The Blair Witch project was refreshing and creative and kinda creepy.  The saddest thing about this film was the sequel.  They tried to make David Lynch's Lost Highway and it didn't work.  Because it was low budget, creative, broke box office records and scared the hell out of some people.  Critics will tear this movie up, go figure.

I'm sure I'm not the only person who went into the theater under the impression that this was real footage of a real event; shame on me for  falling for the marketing of this complete sham!  Not only that, within  three minutes of sitting there watching it, I began to get motion sickness  because of the completely unnecessary jiggling of the camera. They couldn't  even hold the camera still when they were interviewing the supposed  &quot;townfolk&quot; on the streets of Burkittsville.  And then there's the  language.  I don't know if they thought it would be &quot;cool&quot; to say  the &quot;F&quot; word in every sentence, but I just found it thoroughly  disgusting;  I started to hope for the characters to meet their end.  Congratulations must go to the folks who pulled in millions by tricking  their audience.  Worthy of zero stars.	1.0	For shame... all a marketing ploy	1999-12-20	5	2	3
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AVF60NZ99H9D5	Kirk Alex	the blair bitch garbage project. One of the worst, the VERY WORST, pieces of worthless tripe ever put together. To even call this a horror film is LAUGHABLE.You've got the three characters constantly bitching at each other, and the Heather Donahue chick overacting (crying, breathing heavily; hysterical the entire time) to the point that I had to turn the audio down.The late Ed Wood had more talent than the team that put this turkey together.The only thing worthwhile is the old spooky house that the bitchers get to at the end--but then the scenes there only last about three minutes.What a waste of time, money, and everything else. the only reason this crappy flick did the big boxoffice is because the promo campaign behind it was pretty clever--and that's about all that's clever about this  pathetic enterprise.	1.0	pile of dung	2006-03-04	24	7	17
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L	"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip"""	First, I feel like I have to address the buzz surrounding the movie. I am at the same time disgusted and sort of impressed with the hype. It is pretty clever when you think about it.  No trailers (well, they did have some eventually, but still, it took them long enough) no cast members doing the rounds on talk shows, no big budget, etc. Just the website, the documentary on the SciFi channel, and big-time word of mouth. Apparently worked. I feel for those actors, since they got paid about what I make in 2 weeks for 3 weeks of hell. I hope to God the filmmakers were generous and gave them points in the film.I am also hearing that at most theaters, they pay the manager, etc to get up before the showing and get the crowd all hyped up, which is kind of lame. When we saw it Saturday, the owner (before she threatened people who had laser pointers) got up and yelled, &quot;Hey, welcome to Crossroads theater, and ARE YA READY FOR THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT?  Whooooo-hoooo!  Everyone READY TO BE SCARED?&quot; I was like, oh please. I also heard these girls in front of me asking someone next to them if **this was a real documentary**. We got up and moved because I did not want to spend the movie sitting behind someone so incredibly stupid and naive. But I guess that's what a good job they did marketing it, because I heard there are plenty of stupid people out there who think the thing is real. I also grudgingly admire whoever decided to market it initially as a 'hard ticket', meaning they wanted to have it only at one theater or so per city for a few weeks. I'm sure that helped the buzz.  Hyping it as the scariest movie of all time (though maybe this is more word of mouth than the filmmakers doing it) is kind of dumb, though, because people are just going to be disappointed, unless all they've seen are &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;. I heard kids talking after the movie who were let down because they was very little gore, no monster, and no real pay-off.I had a good time because I told myself not to expect anything. I guess if you go, just keep an open mind, and don't think, &quot;This better be the scariest movie of all time after all the hype, or I'll be p**sed&quot;. I do think it's kind of funny how the big studios spend millions of dollars marketing their lame summer 'event' pics, but this is the one most people are talking about wanting to see.So, that's my 2 cents as far as the hype goes. Went and saw BWP for myself a few weeks after in came out.  Inside the theater manager had to come make an announcement about laser pointers, she said if anyone used them during the movie she'd take them away and kick them out. She was this huge, burly, tough woman who looked like a prison warden so people calmed down after that and shut up. Anyway, I loved it. Not the scariest movie I've ever seen, but if you asked me what the scariest movie I've ever seen was, I wouldn't be able to name it. I would saw BWP, the Exorcist, Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer, Last House on the Left (and a couple more I can't think of right now) are like the top scariest. I was really impressed though. Very realistic, the way it was shot and put together, and the character's reactions to stuff. My spouse said it really scared him, which he hardly ever says, because he's been camping and that's like your worst nightmare. The whole movie was very creepy and spooky but the last 5 minutes REALLY scared the crap out of me.It's funny, the audience started out very rowdy, and I thought I'd have to &quot;shhh&quot; people the whole movie. But after the first 5 minutes, people were engrossed. As the film got more and more tense and scary, there were no screams. Instead, the whole audience just sat there cowering quietly in fear. Not a lot of talking back to the screen, etc like there is in most horror movies, and the audience was full of teenagers. That speaks for itself, I think.I read a review in which they said that the movie was all about panic, and I agree. One of the most upsetting things is the way the characters go from calm, controlled, and joking, to nervously joking and then arguing, to trying desperately to hold it together, to understandable total freaked out panic by the last reel. As the film draws to a close they just give up all pretenses of composure and control and just panic and run around like maniacs screaming incoherently at the top of their lungs. Usually when characters in a movie do that you feel like slapping them, but the film draws you in so much that you do not blame them, one bit. You know you would probably act the same way if you were in their shoes, and the way the movie is filmed, you are pretty much in their shoes.Bottom line regarding how scary it is: If I'd been watching it by myself at home at night I probably would have started crying.	3.0	Try to ignore the hype &amp; just keep an open mind if you can.	2000-10-11	35	30	5

That's how powerful this semi-cinema verite camcorder-propelled horror movie is.The actors look like three film students who would actually be rash enough to go into woods supposedly haunted by a witch.  Or woods at all in an area they don't even know.  Witch or no witch, I would think twice.There's a lot of swearing and crudeness that wasn't strictly necessary, but when we're scared and speaking off the cuff we don't always stop to be genteel.Don't watch this with anyone who gets motion sickness from the abrupt camera moves.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AQQJO4W9VF6H8	Kristopher B. Huston	"When I first saw this movie, I was one of those who thought it was real.  I learned later that it wasn't.  I think that is what made this movie.  It was done in such a fashion that made you think you were really watching these people get lost in the woods and having these eerie things happening to them at night. We did not see any witches or creatures or anything of that nature, we just heard wierd noises and activity and in the morning something odd was the result, such as finding the piles of rocks surrounding the campsite that were not there the night before.  Sometimes what you don't see can be scarier then what you do see.  The acting was excellent, the characters were real and convincing.  I felt the way the three dealt with each other and thier indivdual reactions to thier desperate situation seemed very geninue, like it could have happened that way.  It was a very unique idea to do a film in this fashion.I just have one problem with this movie.  You would think that when they found the stream or river that they would just follow it out the of woods.  They interviewed a man fishing at the beggining so you know that river would eventually lead the way home.  Granted that could have been a different river but who cares.  I would rather try that then walk through the woods with no sense of where I am headed, that compass was useless along with the map that one of the characters tossed.  One might agrue, the ""same log"" theory in which they walked in one direction all day and ended up at the same point, as if the ""mystical powers"" of the woods and the ""witch"" were keeping them hostage and not allowing them to leave, and that following the river would not have mattered, and would explain why the map and compass were useless.  In reality if I were lost in the woods and I found a river, I would follow it, and it seemed like a stupid move on thier part not to."	4.0	Very Interesting Concept	2010-01-12	1	1	0

There was really nothing scarry about the movie, although I've come to wonder whether this has something to do with the unadulterated lampooning of the movie after it was released.

But if you believe  in the movie, then the movie has worked it's spell on you, and you're  FREAKIN' SCARED! That's what's so revolutionary and classic about this  film.

The hype itself was moderately clever, and would get three stars from me. (In the same way that Madonna's media manipulation always used to be more interesting than her act.) But I just saw the film. It is boring and irritating beyond belief. I regret that the horror is understated principally because the cast are so irritating. By the time they have shouted, thrown tantrums, run in terror from things that seem, at worst, mildly puzzling and more commonly not interesting at all, bickered and whined their full, I would happily have seen them chainsawed into small pieces, disembowelled by telekinesis, or indeed any fate that a better horror movie might have given them. They deserve bloody gurgling technicolour horror, as does everyone involved in this tedious project. There is no noise, including a railway whistle, that has so relieved me by Stopping, at last, as the whining of these actors. If the Blair Witch herself had deigned to enliven this turkey by making a screen appearance, possibly also decapitating any of the main cast, or the producers, I think I would have fallen in love: I would have her name on my pencil case, simply for Stopping This Movie. But without her, it simply goes on for 85 interminable minutes. The cinematography, such as it was, consisted of spinning the camera around in the woods. Script and acting cannot be evaluating, since they didn't actually appear in this film. Truly a wretched, incompetent, valueless film. One of the worst films I have ever seen in my life, and I have not only seen Indian musicals from the 1970s, I have seen _Funny Girl_ with Barbra Streisand. Now THAT was horror ... Cheers!

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1OH43LS0XADHS	Lawrence Burdick	The first time I saw The Blair witch Project, I loved it. It reminded me of my early days of horror films, sitting up at night watching Creature Features, shaking with terror at the unfolding scene, wanting desperately  to escape but realizing that *not knowing* would scare me more.Blair  Witch is also endearing in the sense that Heather and her friends could  well be you! The students laugh and joke a lot, talking with the optimism  of youth, trusting that the future will continue to unfold in the same  positive way it always has. They never realize, as most young people don't,  that life itself is fragile, and can be lost at any moment. The fact that  the Blair Witch Project portrays this, and then at the end immediately  snuffs it out, is a sign of wisdom and dexterity that is played out with  clarity. James Cameron, look out!The Blair Witch Project marks the  beginning of the end for Hollywood, at a time when success of a film is  marked not by the quality of the story, but by how much money spent in  making it. Studios today routinely brag about how many millions they have  spent, as though that is a sign of craftsmanship. Anyone who has suffered  through Cleopatra or Heaven's Gate will tell you that's not true!Every  decade or so, an amateur film appears  which simply uses quality as its  plan. Easy Rider was one such film. The film may hiss and pop, but you know  you're watching art. Likewise, Blair Witch uses shaky hand-held video cams  and a villain which never actually appears to bring the anxiety and fear of  the film to a fever pitch. Its companion film, Curse of the Blair Witch,  continues in the same vein, offering tantalizing glimpses into the obscure  forces which have caused the disappearance of the young filmmakers.When  being viewed, you cannot help but sweat, because you *know* something bad  is going to happen, and you wonder why the impending victim can't see it  coming. The Wicker Man was like this. So was Alien.I wish I could give  this film a top rating, but I can't.What stops me from giving this film  (as well as Curse of the Blair Witch) five stars are the glaring holes in  its logic and its background. For example (spoiler warning! If you haven't  seen the film, read no further!), in the very beginning, Heather Donahue is  showing the camera the supplies she is bringing along, one of which is a  book on survival in the woods. Well, for the record, I have that book in my  collection (I'm a bookseller by profession) and it tells what to do when  you get lost! So why didn't they simply use that to find their way out of  the woods? This is an error that should have been caught, and cut out of  the film as it neatly destroys the entire premise of the film. Second, the  sheer idiocy of Mike throwing away the map is simply unbelievable. That's  like saying, &quot;My car's not working, so I'm burying the keys.&quot; No  sense at all!In Curse of the Blair Witch, we are told that the township  of Blair is resettled in 1825 when a railroad crew happens upon the  abandoned village and renames it Burkittsville. Nice touch, but the writers  didn't do their homework (again!). The first railroad engine was built in  1829 (the Stourbridge Lion) in England, and then exported to the United  States. Furthermore, in Curse, during the History of the Blair Witch  sequence, the video shows what appears to be a handsome woodburning steam  train whose track is being laid. I have tentatively identified the engine  as a 4-4-0 Number 7 of the Atlantic and and Great Western Railroad (a  predecessor of the Erie). But this train wasn't built until 1862(!) at the  Cooke Locomotive Works, in Paterson, N.J. (I take my information from  Railroad History in Photographs, by Anthony Thompson, Signature Press,  1996. Also, All Kinds of Trains, by Ron White, Grosset and Dunlap, 1972).Still later in the Blair Witch History, during the execution of Rustin  Parr, a grim photograph of the criminal on the gallows is shown. A man in  the crowd is shown wearing a straw boater hat. Another chronological error!  Straw hats like that (the same kind that Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck wear  during their Vaudeville act)were common summer outdoors wear beginning in  1890 and lasting until around 1929.In sum, Blair Witch Project and  Curse of the Blair Witch are great for an evening scare. The horror creeps  up on you until the final scene when you're literally quaking with terror.  This is as it should be for a horror film. But afterwards, the  inconsistencies drag you back to reality, and you can't help but  think....Wait a minute!	3.0	Great Film, Lots of Scares, but...	2000-02-11	1	1	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1L43KWWR05PCS	Lawyeraau	This is a film that one either loves or hates. Well, I am in the former category. My daughter and I saw this film when it was first released and, given its hype at the time, were inclined to think that it was no biggie. Well, we were wrong. My daughter was frightened out of her wits, and I must confess that I, too, was creeped out by this inventive and imaginative low budget film.Shot with hand held cameras, it is an ostensible would-be documentary filmed by three young adults on a backwoods Maryland legend called the Blair Witch. Shortly after filming some of the local yokels in Burkettsville (once known as the town of Blair), Maryland, our three intrepid filmmakers enter the woods where the witch did her dastardly deeds.Venturing ever deeper into the woods, what initially starts as a romp into local history slowly turns into a terror filled foray, where unknown entities nightly make spooky noises outside their campsite, leave behind cairns ostensibly built for each of them, and gelatinous deposits of an unknown origin are left on personal belongings. They also stumble upon an eerie site where a multitude of strange stick figures are found hanging oddly from trees. Lost in the woods, they stumble about these genuinely creepy woods, their fear ever escalating, as does that of the viewer.As these young filmmakers are never seen nor heard from again, what happened to them can only be gleaned from their unedited film footage that was found sometime after their disappearance. This is what the viewer is actually watching, a sort of cinema verite. It is actually a film within a film. The shaky camera work adds an air of authenticity to the film, though it is a bit of a dizzying prospect.Of course, there is no real Blair Witch Project, the film is a mock documentary, and the people in the films are just actors, but the directors, actors, and everyone involved in this film certainly understand the concept that less is more, turning in one of the spookiest, most original and inventive horror films ever to grace the silver screen.	5.0	SCARY...CREEPY...WEIRD...	2006-11-06	0	0	0

I guess they have never been in the Woods alone or watched this movie with a couple of lights on. I must admit that you can't compare  watching this movie in front of your TV/Video and watching it in cinema,  where the sounds and noises that the scares of this movie depend on are of  much better effect. But, this movie is a hundred times more original and  scary than any SCREAM, I DON'T GIVE A DAMM WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, or  Haloween sequel. The Point is that you have to use your imagination instead  of being visual fed with all the things that happen. Therefore I think that  many people aren't used to this, so they perhaps didn't get the movie. I  think you can't compare the Blair Witch Project to any other Movie out  there. The Actors are beheaving absolutely natural, you don't get the  impression that they had to study any script, you rather think that these  three people were left out in the woods to make a documentary about a  witch. You need an open mind for this movie, that enables you to rise above  the standard horror film conditions.

While trying to find a graveyard in the woods, where the bodys of children  who were supposedly killed by the blair witch lie, they get lost and find a  clearing with all these piles of rocks in it instead. At night they keep  hearing freaky noises and they think some dangerous thing is following  them. One morning, they wake up and go out of their tent to find three  piles of rocks have been placed in a triangle, with their tent in the  middle. The same rocks as the ones they ran into. From there, things start  worse for them. Much worse.	3.0	Not what I expected, but OK.	2000-04-09	1	1	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1N643TZ48RPG7	Leonard Snerdley	For four years, this movie chilled me to the bone.  It also sickened me, because I couldn't believe that someone would actually try and profit off someone's death.  That seemed pretty low.  It wasn't until 2003 that a friend of mine let me know this thing was a hoax.  While I was relieved, I was also pretty angry.If my anger seems misplaced to you, let me try and explain.  If this is not a real documentary, what's the purpose of making it so poorly?  Shaky video cameras - it looks like my Christmas videos.  Do you think someone would pay me to watch those?  &quot;The Legend of Boggy Creek&quot;, which covers many of the same issues and is done in a semi-documentary style, is made with much higher production values, and as a result is much, much scarier.  Watch it with the lights off if you don't believe me.  Also, I can't get behind any horror movie that never shows its monster.  How am I supposed to know what to be afraid of?  A shaking tent?  Stick figures?I give it three stars for the idea and one star for the execution.  I'm off to watch &quot;Boggy Creek&quot; again.	1.0	What's the point?	2004-07-16	17	4	13

But if you tend to let your imagination run away with you and you  are able to picture this happening to you then you will love it. This film  portrays it as if you are there with them and you only see and know what  they know. There are now super brave heroes and there are no slimmy  creatures. Only the dark, strange noises, and something constantly watching  you. I liked it because it is very realistic. The characters panic, cry,  and blame one another just like any normal human would do in real life. But  i still prefer the blood and gore as well so i am in between.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1A7DA5RUW22A1	LJG Carson	"""I'm scared to close my eyes...but i'm too scared to open them.""The Blair Witch was suggested one of the scariest films of 1999 and instantly became a cult classic.In Burkittsville, Maryland, three film students took off into the dark woods to make a documentry about the lengendary inhabitant of the forest, the Blair Witch. They were never seen again...until their video footage was found by the authorities. The footage they found shows the activities of the three students before their terrifying disappearance.Well, Blair Witch is not a fantastic movie and some viewers will definitely be put off by the movie's pacing, lack of action and amount of dialouge. But on closer inspection, we should appreciate the movie for what it is. A VERY chilling experience.The three actors deliver their parts very well, making Blair Witch an all more real effect. See the look of terror on their faces? That's REAL fear!A good characteristic of horror films i have always admired is the idea that somewhere in the darkness, someone (or something) is lurking. It's what's unseen that scares us the most and the movie relies mainly on the disturbing sounds in the woods (eerie laughing, weeping children, twigs cracking under foot etc.) and the characters' reaction to the situation they are in. The note of shear panic in their voices is what's really scary.This movie may not be totally satisfying to some, but will leave most people shaken inside. This movie is a rather enjoyable piece of pyhcological horror with a good few DVD extras to keep fans occupied for a short while. Unfortunately, the sequel - ""Blair Witch: Book of Shadows"" - didn't match up by any standards."	3.0	If something wicked was coming your way...	2005-02-24	2	0	2

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AC12ZJ44TC1KP	"""lodengarl"""	This movie succeeded on so many levels.  It felt like a real experience, which worked.  Not since Texas Chainsaw Massacre have I seen a movie that disturbed me with images and suggestions, and no blood.  If you allow  yourself to get into the movie, enjoy the characters and follow their  demise - you will love the movie.  Some great spontaneous humor, and the  realization that you are lost in a foreign wood is gripping.  The most  enjoyable aspect is the breakdown of the group social structure and the  breakdown of human decency...you get to see what it is like to skate on the  edge of lunacy - lost and hunted.  The paranormal evil is gripping as well.  I find the wails of a child in the woods in the dead of night even more  gripping than someone just leaping out and hacking them up...the terror is  there because it is the occult, and it reeks of more than a silly serial  killer or backwoods nut.There must be some suspension of  disbelief...yeah they would not use the cameras all the time (but you must  accept that as a viewer that the director needs to tell the story through  the cameras, so it is no big deal).  Why didn't they have a cell phone?  This story took place according to the makers, a while back, when cell  phones were not common and you must remember, these campers thought they  were going to be back within a day or two...not a tough hike, and a lot of  backwoods areas, cell phones did not work either.If you are into hype  you will be disappointed...if you are expecting cinematic brilliance, you  will be disappointed.  If you do not like character development and subtle  terror you will not like this film.  But...if you have ever been camping,  alone or with friends, in the backwoods, and you have ever woken up to a  far off cry, or seen something very eerie, this movie will play on that  till the end...and that is what makes this film great in my opinion.  Bottom line, it kicks the butt of so many Hollywood films that follow  formulaic plotlines and cinematics...if anything, you will enjoy this movie  for being original!	5.0	Excellent - gripping and gritty.	2000-06-20	4	2	2

The three main characters never met a sentence with the ""f"" word they didn't love.  Despite this lexical obsession, and despite Heather, who talked too much and later on screamed too much, I thought it did a great job of creating fear.  We're all afraid of the big bad witch, and most of us have gotten lost or fear getting lost in a forest, especially at night when there are always strange unidentifiable sounds out there.  You put those two together with three kids who, although they're actors, aren't given much in the way of formal dialogue and are deliberately food-deprived and pranked by the director to make their interactions with each other more negative and their fright more authentic-looking, and you've got a naturalistic documentary-style horror movie without even the appearance of witches or ghosts.

It's completely different and refreshing. It reminds me of watching any regular family's home videos, which have some kind of campy yet relate-able appeal. I felt like I was really watching someone's video, instead of a movie that was trying to make it appear like it.Also, I like how the horror snuck up you. Still watching halfway through, it still feels like a regular camping scenario (which I still enjoyed watching because I've done my share of hiking in the woods myself), but then they find strange objects. As the movie progresses, they continue to find ""presents"" which get stranger and stranger, and the scenario at the very end was very eerie indeed.You never see any ""ghosts"" or hear anything out of the ordinary, which adds to the creepiness. Their hike is like any hike that you or I may experience, except that the more lost they get, the stranger things become. Only, these strange things could very easily happen in real life.I just have some questions. I'll try to make them as vague as possible for those who still haven't seen the movie. What was in that bundle of sticks that the girl unwrapped (I couldn't tell what exactly it was)? Why were those hand prints there? Why was the guy just standing there (or how should I say, why couldn't he move? I would've been fighting tooth and nail)Still, the whole atmosphere of the movie towards the end is just super creepy, and I had to wait a while until I could go to sleep, lol."	5.0	Better than Expected	2009-10-29	2	2	0

It scared me like nothing has scared me before. I'm an adult mind you, and I ended up staying awake all night and all the next day. All I kept seeing was images of this movie in my mind. I thought I would never be the same again! Then I found out it was fictional.Okay, now it does not have the same appeal it once did. I re-watched it tonight during my ""Halloween Horror movie marathon"". It was NOT nearly as scary as the first time around. But, I admit, it still has some creepy moments.I'm not one to get freaked out about blood and gore. I watched ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" when I was 5 or 6 years old (I had older brothers). Now I can watch those movies without blinking an eye. I have no interest in those type of movies.I give ""The Blair Witch Project"" credit for not using gore as the scare factor. Fear of the unknown is a lot scarier. The baby crying in the woods definitely gave me a chill up the spine along with the bloody handprints of children.For those of you who said the ending was horrible and it left you with a ""That's it???""

Three teens investigate the local Blair Witch legend by wandering around a forest with a video camera. Upon my initial viewing I was disappointed but the film does grow on you. You don't see much in this movie but there is some tension and dread that builds up as the teens become unglued as they get disoriented in the forest. The main problem is that the picture and audio quality are not up to snuff in this release due to the way the film was originally filmed. There is an hour of bonus content. Amazon reviewers rate this a lowly 3 stars. Fans who own the DVD won't notice much difference. Essentially this is a 4 star film in a 3 star package.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A4SY5RCGC5CH9	"Maciej ""Darth Maciek"""	"I liked this original and atypical film A LOT! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.At the very beginning we learn that in October 1994 filmmaking students Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville (formerly known as Blair), Maryland while shooting a documentary. The topic of their film was a horrible crime committed in the 1940s by Rustin Parr, a deranged man who before his execution claimed he was forced to commit murder by the spirit of Elly Kedward, a woman hanged in the XVIII century after being accused of witchcraft. A year after their disappearance, their footage was found by police...When released in 1999 this film made certainly a big impact on the viewers and critics alike, mostly by its originality. The concept of ""found footage"" was actually used occasionally before, but none of such films was very good (well, with the exception of Belgian made ""Man Bite Dog"" from 1992, which kind of is a ""found footage"" film). This film on another hand is not only original but also good, mostly because of the quality of the story and of the work with camera. After watching it, it is easy to understand why this film propelled the whole ""found footage"" genre into the mainstream of Hollywodian cinema.It is however much more difficult to make a good ""found footage"" film than one can think and as result it was necessary to wait until 2007 to see another movie of this kind which would be of similar quality to ""Blair Witch Project"" - it was of course the first ""Paranormal Activity""... Since them some other films managed to do as well, especially ""Cloverfield"" and Norwegian ""Troll Hunter"" - but quite a lot of more failed to reach the same level of quality, like the initially very promising ""Apollo 18"".This film is not exactly a horror in the usual meaning of words as we never see what exactly threatens the three students lost in woods - but ultimately a cold chill creeps into this experience once we realize that leaving this darn cold wet forest is for humans as difficult as escaping a spider web when you are a fly... The more they struggle, the worse they trap themselves... And that kind of nightmare is always a pretty scary experience...I cannot say that this is a great masterpiece, but there is definitely something in this film which I never saw or felt before. With a very limited budget the unexperienced makers of ""Blair Witch Project"" managed to do a greatly original thing, cleverly disturbing and artistically successful. And that deserves five stars - not one less. Enjoy!"	5.0	"""We are hungry, cold - and hunted. I'm scared to close my eyes, I'm scared to open them! We're gonna die out here!"""	2014-02-11	2	2	0

Half the time it's a bunch of idiot, hick kids screaming at each other, the other half of the time you have no idea what's going on because all you see is dark, shaky, camera shots.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3IY9HIAMJQ7HL	Marcel Lee	"Three filmmakers travel into the woods of Burkittsville (Maryland) to investigate folklore about a local witch, and watching them blab and bicker is interesting enough. It's when they get lost trying to find their way back to the car that things start to get captivatingly gloomy. All the additional dread, the ""witch"" stuff, sort of goes against that fact. Being lost in the middle of nowhere, in the cold with a minimum amount of food and water, is scary enough. That alone should probably be the gist of the plot. Being taunted and haunted by evil spirits every night nears conceptual overkill; especially when one of your companions disappear, leaving just one other person between you and the kind of lonely dread that dominates nightmares.It's a movie, a fictional one presented as a set of real-life documentary-style video clips, but everything from the way the characters act to the brilliantly inane things they say seem almost too real to come out of just another horror script. In a sense, it is. The dialogue, all or most of it, is reportedly improvised, just as it would be if this wasn't just a movie. No, this Blair Witch Project isn't particularly scary, unless perhaps you actually believe in witchcraft, but it's quite a compelling character study. I suspect people like this would react like this in a situation like this. Nothing, aside from the actual ""witch"" part itself, seems unreal; particularly at the end when all hope is lost, fear takes over and the girl starts screaming for her life.marcellee.com"	4.0	4 of 5	2013-04-23	1	1	0

They even tented some film from the late 60s, early 70s to simulate  the degrading of the dyes that cause the image to be mostly yellow.

I am an avid horror buff and one of the die hards that think nothing scary was made since the  Exorcist or The Haunting. Blair Witch delivers innovative and refreshing  film making, but unfortunately, not too many real scares. I applaud the  effort to follow in The Haunting's footsteps and create a film that  includes the audience in it's creation by allowing us to use our  immagination. This is suitable horror for the post-teen Scream/I Know What  You Did Last Summer audience.

I could not believe it. This was the famous Blair Witch Project, which seems to have caused so many sleepless  nights and even made it on the covers of TIME amd NEWSWEEK. I just can't  see why. There was not one creepy moment in the whole movie. The whole  thing was so dull that you could only laugh about it. Okay, 3 people are  lost in the woods. They are frightened, they fear for their lifes. What are  they doing? They are filming each other!  They hear sombody scream, they  come to a mysterious house. What are they doing? Are they looking for some  kind of weapon? Maybe a stone or a branch? No, they are still filming!  One  of the filmers gets lost. What is the other doing? You got it, he is still  filming!

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A13WK0568LZNL0	"Mark Coffey ""austindeadhead"""	First of all, as a counterargument to some of the criticisms - true, documentarians don't record every single little thing - or do they? After all, this was a student project that was presumably meant to be edited later, so why not get as much on camera as possible? Nothing happens, say some - but that's the point of this movie, your imagination supplies what isn't shown on the screen (perfect example - Heather running through the woods, screaming &quot;What was that?&quot; at something unseen).  Too much of the F-word, cry others - well, hate to burst your bubble, but a lot of young people talk this way, for better or worse; there is certainly nothing unrealistic about a lot of profanity. Enough with the &quot;Devil's Advocate&quot;, though - here's what makes this a five-star DVD. First, good bonus materials - Curse of the Blair Witch adds some nice details. Second, nice presentation, i.e., the menus and background screens. Third, and most important, it's easy to criticize this movie for all the hype, but the premise is genuinely creative, the methodology for the performances is very smart (shoot &quot;real-time&quot;, keep actors on their toes with the unexpected), and the ending of this movie is just about the spookiest damn thing I have ever seen. If you haven't seen Blair Witch yet, forget the hype and try to lose yourself in the experience of the students - and turn the lights off. If you're like me, this movie will stay with you for days.	5.0	Haunting and Memorable	2001-08-29	8	7	1

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	ATC69EUL68BEF	Mark Freedman	It took me 5 years to get to watching this film, and now that I have, it's a bit sad coming here to read the reviews and realizing how few people left in society have an imagination.The whole point is to place yourself into their situation, and imagine what these doomed souls went through.  In my opinion, it was pulled off flawlessly.  Are the characters whiners?  Of course they are!  We'd all be in the same situation.  Was there a bunch of drawn out scenes that went on and on about the complaining?  Of course -- life is not an edited film clip!  The whole point was to make this seem like these people were real, filming a documentary, to be edited LATER.Realize that this film is supposed to show mainly the found raw footage taken by these doomed individuals.  Raw = unedited, and more real than a lot of us are comfortable with.  I think they accomplished exactly what they set out to do.  And the box office bears this out.To place three unknown actors in an environment where they had to ad-lib, and to spook them out of their minds was genious.  It also took a hell of a lot of guts for these three to agree to such a project, although I'm sure they considered it a worthy career risk.I don't know if I want to see the so-called sequel, but I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes to be absorbed by the characters and situations of a movie.  If you require maximum external stimulation, stay far away from this movie, and continue vegging in front of MTV.	5.0	So Many People Just Don't Get It, and That's Sad	2004-07-24	14	8	6

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2NC5BMF6QWC5B	Mark Laflamme	"The people who don't enjoy a good fright flick are usually those who are unable to suspend belief for 90 minutes at a time. In anticipation of this, the creators of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" perhaps drunk beyond measure, found a way to make it easier for everyone to believe the horror they were delivering.Before the movie goer even got to theater, he had been bombarded with television commercials, news clips and a meteor shower of Internet ads presenting the film as the true documentary gone awry and captured on film. They did it convincingly. But no amount of early hype could prepare the audience for the eerily authentic feel of what appears to be an amateur movie filmed by kids who stumble into something truly horrific.I love ""The Blair Witch Project"" because it never blinks. For the duration of the movie, you feel like you're experiencing a morbid, voyeuristic glimpse into the last days in the lives of these hapless adventurers. Throughout the movie is a pervasive sense of evil and danger, although the creators wisely never show you much of anything. The fear comes from noises in the woods, cryptic symbols that appear everywhere, the lingering uneasiness from legends about the woods in which these teenagers walk.When they become lost, you, the viewer feel lost as well. When their panic rises, so does your own. The often bouncing, jerky filming only adds to the realism and to the rising horror of the events unfolding.The movie provokes your mood and gives away only enough of the visuals. Was that a finger that poor girl found wrapped in tattered cloth? Or a tongue? Is everyone still together as they run through the woods on that night of terror? Or has what's-his-name been left behind at the tent? With this poor lighting and bouncing camera work, it's hard to tell.""Blair Witch"" is the kind of movie that will exhaust you. Muscles tense up early in the movie and they don't relax until you're far from the theater. The final scene of the movie is just... blech. Jarring, realistic and open to interpretation, the kind that will leave you stammering about it for the rest of the night.This is a movie that could do for camping what Jaws did for cool ocean swims. And yet, having reflected upon it, I'm up for watching it again. One of the best horror films to come along in many years."	5.0	It really happened, you know...	2006-04-30	5	3	2
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1GDXA5BRXLDAU	Mark Lovejoy	"Mark Freedman/s review, of the first few I read, says it all.  This is supposed to be raw, *unedited* footage shot by *amateurs* and not something ""professionally"" made.  The psychological breakdown of all three under prolonged stress (some sensed resentment on the guy's part to going, then to Heather herself; very little preparation for emergencies or things going wrong; the isolation; becoming lost; food runs out; strange things begin to happen and keep *on* happening, especially at night; one of the guys disappear, leaving no note and all of his gear behind; the stick figures; the cabin; the final scene) was one thing that interested me.  It would be interesting to read a psychologist's/psychiatrist's take on this.The official website ([...]) fills in a lot of blanks.  The ""diary"" of Heather helps too, especially comparing her perceptions of reality to what's on the film and audio tapes, her Pagan leanings hinted at, her thoughts both before and during the project, ""flesh out"" the character.If you like gore, violent death, and women in skimpy outfits, see your typical slasher movie; but for sheer fright, the chance to let your imagination run wild speculating on what's going on, and the implications behind it (for example, in her diary Heather admits to cutting down one of the stick figures they found shortly before the end, and that night the ""strangeness"" factor jumped a couple of notches--had she desecrated a sacred site?), and the fact their gear was found BURIED UNDER A HOUSE (couldn't have been Mother Nature doing that) see this movie.  But, don't let small children see it, both for the fright and the language.  Frequent use is made of almost every obscenity/profanity in the English tongue.I could hardly wait to see it again after the first time!"	5.0	"Best ""non-gore"" horror film I've seen in years!"	2004-09-24	4	2	2
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AJU9V9FTSX7XJ	Mark Striegel	Imagine, if you will, ponying up the dough to buy a new car.  But instead of buying a car, you say 'I'm going to make a movie'.  When you inform the public of your plans, they laugh at you, saying 'Man, you aint got no budget! How in the heck are you going to make a movie?!' You ignore their taunts, and round up three amateur actors and start to work.  Here is your story: 'Three film students go into the woods to shoot a documentary about a local legend, and mysteriously vanish.  A year later, their footage was found.'  The movie takes three days to film, over half of it using a b&w; 45mm camcorder.  Because the film is supposed to be composed of 'found' footage, you do not need to spend the money to improve its quality.  Then at last, you reveal you finnished product to the public.  The response is overwelming.  Grown men, after seeing the film, swear that they will never go camping or even set foot into the woods again.  The movies grosses over 2 million.  In the end, it has become the most successful independent film of all time.This is the story of the Blair Witch Project, one of my favorite horror films ever.  The fear factor is not based on what you can see, but what you can't; which in my opinion is much more effect than all the gory mutilation in most contemporary horror films.

If the plot had been better thought out and had been given more interesting twists, it would have been great. But most was predictable (at least in a general sense if not a specific sense). They seemed to rush through the investigative phase with interviews and some discussion, but there could have been SO MUCH more done here. Then, they spent WAY too long with just fear... which was only sometimes frightening to viewers... often just showing build-up and panic over the exact same things... thus very few surprises.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O	"MartinP ""MartinP"""	Clearly, going by some of the reviews below, the presentday special-effects-hungry fans of slick, expensively made horror movies don't think much of the BWP. It bespeaks of a worrying lack of imagination, and it is their loss. BWP is such a tremendously effective movie simply because it never spills the beans. There is no witch to be seen; for all you know by the end, there may be a perfectly natural (if not quite sane) explanation for the occurences that have come to pass. It is all in the eye of the beholder, and that is what makes this the one and only horror movie I ever saw that actually cost me a night of sleep. Even without the hype and the 'mockumentary', the build-up of suspense is almost unbearable. The realism of the acting, the unpreposessing and equally realistic medium of unsteady videoshots and 16mm film, and the oppressive monotony of the autumnal woods, set the mood in an incomparable way, and draw you in. By the time uncanny things start to happen, they are almost as unsettling to the viewer as they are to the three hapless students in their flimsy tent. Another great thing about this movie is that its impact does not diminish with repeated viewing - it's not one of those movies like The Sixth Sense or The Others that loose most of their appeal once you know the clue.The mocked up Blair Witch documentary is a treat in itself. It lends complexity and depth to the story, while at the same time displaying an amusing tongue-in-cheek sense of humor. In all, in a time when the Exorcist seems silly rather than scary, and plots that depend on a single clever twist have been done to death, this good old-fashioned ghost story is a godsend. Don't miss it - if anything, it is a six-star, not a three-star movie.	5.0	A first: a horror movie that is actually scary!	2006-02-05	13	11	2

I didn't get a very good chance to see it at the  Local Cinema and rentals were taken,so I waited for it to appear on  Television.It premeired several days ago.I realized that after viewing it I  hadn't missed a thing.It's the worst horror film I've ever seen in my  entire life.The photography is without a doubt the worst I've ever  seen,and I'm sure you'll agree too.Half the time I didn't have a single  clue of what was going on.There's way too much comotion and the angles are  way too fast.Besides having incredibly terrible photography,Blair Witch  has uniformly horrible acting.Every character present is  strictly  zero-dimensional,and the three film-making students are REALLY  irritating,and that is saying A LOT.Trust me.it is.The direction from  Daniel Myrick &amp; Eduardo Sanchez is just plain bad.These men are an  insult to REAL horror mavens,like Wes Craven (A Nightmare On Elm  Street,Scream),Don Coscarelli (Phantasm) and John Carpenter (Halloween,The  Thing [1982 remake] ).In short: This is undoubtably the worst horror  film I've ever seen.Not a single thing was good about it.Please don't  listen to the good reviews it's gotten.Do yourself a fovor and rent a REAL  horror movie,like Phantasm &amp; Halloween.Trust me.I'm telling you the  truth.	1.0	WORST HORROR FILM EVER HANDS DOWN	2000-08-25	11	1	10

Seems most of the people that 5star this film don't know what the hell a horror film is supposed to be. This was nothing but watching people in the woods crying and sniffiling with mucus hanging out their noses for almost 2 hours. I've seen home footage of kids birthday parties that had more suspense. This film was so boring... I mean who the hell would this scare? People affraid of the woods? huh? Seriously... is this made to scare people that have a phobia against trees and foliage? Oh geez that's scary as hell! I mean what could be more boring than watching people walk around in the woods for hours? Then the climax of the story is seeing some guy standing in a corner. WHoopie Dee freakin do! A guy standing in the corner! Holy cow that's scary frightining as hell. A guy on time out... there's something to be affraid of. The only thing that scared me about this film was how successful it was. How could this absolute highschool video project become so successful? I mean seriously? Awful plot... awful acting...Awful scenery as in your just watching the G-damn woods the entire lenght of the film and people walking and arguing. I mean wth was this?

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2FJ626ENNARXR	"""maskedmonk"""	According to this movie, there is no fear like fear of the unknown. This is true in real life, but not in movies. If you don't remotely know what is happening in a movie, you don't experience ultimate fear -- you get BORED.That's the problem with this movie - nothing happens in it. Nothing at all. It starts out with some &quot;interviews&quot; with local people about the Blair Witch. We learn that the Blair Witch used to be the Burkittsville Witch. This is ALL we learn in this approximately three hour period. Then Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Josh Leonard decide to wander around aimlessly in the forest, and immedietly get lost. They lose their map, swear a lot, and discover that one member of their group has erratic body hair. Then, one morning, as Heather exits their tent, she realizes that something is moving in a nearby bush. She moves closer, only to see that it is a small pile of rocks! But this small pile of rocks is angry, and it has a chainsaw! Heather runs away screaming into the woods, but the small pile of rocks chases after her, and Heather eventually (according to the laws of horror movies) trips on a tree branch, is inexplicably unable to get up, and is hacked to bits by the angry rock pile's chainsaw.I'm kidding. Having a pile of rocks attack someone with a chainsaw would be out of place in The Blair Witch Project, because it was the intent of the creative minds behind it to make a movie where literally nothing happens, and some rocks armed with a chainsaw constitutes &quot;something.&quot; I think I speak for all of us when I say a movie with &quot;things&quot; in it would be unacceptable.Heather, Michael, and Josh do see some rocks and run away from them screaming, though. They also encounter (run away screaming from) some evil sticks, a psychotic slime mold, and finally a particularly murderous pine cone. Then, they wander around, and after a while the movie ends. I think they died.Do not see this movie. Don't even watch it when it's on TV, it could turn out that you have a ratings box in your TV without knowing it and then YOU would be personally responsible for giving money to people who think sticks are scary. You don't want that.	1.0	Bore Witch Project (I can't do a good title so here's a pun)	2001-07-26	8	4	4
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	A few years ago, two young guys, who had recently graduated from a little film school in Florida, decided to make a little movie. With help from friends and families, they came up with around $30,000 to make the movie. Luckily, they got this picture entered in a great big film festival, where a little company called Artisan Entertainment cut a good deal with the boys and got the rights to distribute the movie. The people at Artisan devised one of the best publicity campaigns in Hollywood history. And so it was that The Blair Witch Project went on to gross over $125,000,000 in North American theaters. The young guys, David Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez became legend. Better yet in some people's eyes, they and everybody at Artisan got rich. Only in America, as we like to say.I tell this story party because it's interesting, but mostly because the phenomenon that is The Blair Witch Project has thrown most logical attempt to discuss its merits as a movie into disarray. The problem is that, not since Easy Rider in the 1960s, have so many people seen a movie done on a shoestring. Many of these folks have said how original it is when compared to standard Hollywood fare. It is, but I wonder if that would have been true if the two young guys' budget had been a hundred times bigger. I fear the movie is a fluke, and while it may entice studios to support independent producers, it will not herald a new era in what pictures we see. The system does not change that fast. In other words, don't expect to see a surge in original movies.I personally was enthralled by The Blair Witch Project, but I warn you that a tiny budget can buy only so much. There are no sets, no special effects, no actors you ever saw before, and virtually no music. It is as lean as a movie can get. Artisan did spend quite a bit of money to clean up the film negative and to create stereo sound, but 16 mm film stock will always be cheap and grainy when compared to standard 35 mm film. In addition, the majority of the movie was shot with handheld cameras. Many scenes lurch and careen around and are apt to make some viewers get motion sickness.The idea of the movie is quite clever. Three students disappear in the Maryland woods while making a documentary about a local legend called the Blair witch. A year later, the film they shot is found. This is pieced together into a sort of documentary that acts as a photographic record of what happened. The directors even gave the characters the real names of the actors who played them. The result is a pseudo-documentary which is perhaps made all the more frightening by what it does not show. It is the first hit movie in ages that leaves so much to a viewer's imagination. You are left with more questions than answers. Some people will be totally frustrated by this, while others will be exhilarated.The three students are played by Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard. This is the first movie any of them have appeared in, and we are lucky that all of them prove to be talented actors. Donahue is especially effective as the group's leader. The way she seems to age, as she goes from happy young girl to terrified woman, is remarkable. Her transition from authority figure to someone on the brink of madness is terrifying.Because it doesn't have the razzle-dazzle you are so used to in your movies, you are apt to decide that The Blair Witch Project isn't scary at all. Maybe you'll even decide it's dumb. Maybe you'll laugh at its amatuerish appearance. And maybe you'll find yourself constantly glancing over your shoulder the next time you take a walk in the woods, because, just maybe, those woods are never going to end and you'll be lost in them forever. How can you be sure?	4.0	The Little Movie That Could	2002-03-21	6	4	2
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1PCDF44ZI9TIS	matthewhornick@hotmail.com	If all of these people who complained about the blair witch because it wasn't real; would have just used their heads in the first place they would have realized that no one would release a movie about three people that are  still missing.  Having said that, if you look at the movie as strictly a  source of entertainment I think you would find that it is one of the most  suspenseful movies ever made.  Everyone walked into the movie theaters  knowing that the Exorcist was just a movie, but it still firghtened the  moviegoers.  Let this movie take you in and you will be frightened and very  much entertained.  The great thing about this movie is that there isn't one  bit of visible decapitations, disembowelments, or the like.  It was a  completely original idea and I respect the filmmakers and actors for what  they did to make the movie.  I reccommend that you at least rent the movie  and experience it for yourselves.  But I am going to buy it becuase it was  original, engrossing and the scariest movie I've seen since the exorcist!	4.0	It is just a movie, purely for entertainment purposes only	1999-09-08	0	0	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2SHEEPH02A61E	Matt McGlaughlin	The concept behind this movie was basically raw is better, and raw leads to realism.  This movie was filmed with a not-so-professional camera in order to add a natural, uncontrived feel.  This would have worked if the script were a little more developed.  Natural is not cursing every two seconds.  I mean they couldn't say a sentence without throwing in about five curses and blaming each other for being lost.  There were a few suspenseful parts, especially the end but for the most part the horror was lacking.  They tried to go for the whole mental breakdown thing, but it did not succeed.  Great idea, however this overrated flop only attempts to scare you with it's colorful language.	2.0	Overrated, disappointing, yet it could have been great!	2000-12-10	0	0	0

And I have seen a lot of them.I saw this in the theater wen the phenomena was going on.And the question did this really happen or not? Was being asked If you watched Curse of the Blair Witch that was TV it sure made it look like it did. But most of us know it did notThe people that did not like this movie are some of the ones that did not understand it.One thing you must understand before watching it is that it is an independent film. And they did not have a big budget to spent on it.All of the film is shot with handheld Camcorders that are very shaky at times and spooky the next. That make you fill like you are more in the movie then watching it.The Story is about three film students that go in to the woods to shoot a documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch.The three end up getting lost and are never seen again.The only thing that is found is the film that they were shooting.What you see is what they filmed and what happened to some of them.Even if you can not watch the shaky, motion-sickness-inducing camerawork You Must See The End It Will Shock You	5.0	The Blair Witch Project	2002-08-21	2	1	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AZZ4GD20C58ND	M. Brookes	I remember watching this when it first came out and not being greatly impressed. It wasn't a bad film by any means, but it didn't match up to the hype surrounding it's release. I thought I'd give it another watch and I'll confess that I enjoyed it more this time round.That's not say that it's a great film, far from it, but it is a solid horror movie that makes good use of very little. It's biggest strength for me is that it relies more on atmosphere and building the feeling of tension rather than shocks or cheap camera tricks.The lost footage format has been used many times since, but what The Blair Witch Project gets right compared to most of these later films is that it feels authentic, most films of a similar vein had obviously higher production values that fight with the raw footage concept.The film's story is a simple one, local legend tells of a witch that haunts the forest. A team of young film makers head into the woods to film a documentary about the legend. The story progresses at a slow pace, it teases at the presence in the woods and most of the film is simply the crews' reactions to these clues. It does however build pace to an abrupt and slightly enigmatic ending.Much has been made of the film's very low budget and while it shows it doesn't really harm the film. In part it aids the authentic feel of the film, it also forces the film makers to get a lot from very little, which they do manage to achieve.So while the story isn't particularly new, the format was reasonably so (for its time) and it still stands as a decent horror watch.	4.0	Decent horror	2013-09-24	1	1	0

I found the film itself to be extremely boring, and all of the characters extremely annoying. The only non-annoying person in the entire movie was the very first guy to disappear.

They weren't endearing characters, there was only the scantiest of a  plot, which made me hate them all the more, and the ending was  just...there. If you like cheap scares, see The Mummy.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AHV5MHBNURXRU	Melissa Miller	This is a short review of what I remember seeing when this film was in the theatre.  My name is Sean and I'm writing in my wife's place.So much hype was made over this movie and it became the must see film of the time.  You could only see it in bohemian film houses at the time in San Diego and of course they were the most expensive, $12 I think, which at the time was insane.  I went with my girlfriend, now wife, at the time and we were true horror film junkies.We went in with a reasonable expectation of what a horror film would be like.  Most of them are cliche' and have a similar story line, but we like to see the new twists that filmmakers dream up.  Everyone was lead to believe that it was a recovered camera from a lost documentary film crew, so we forgave the fact that the film was boring at the beginning.  The problem was that it just stayed boring the entire time.  It didn't take long to figure out that it wasn't real and we kept waiting for some kind of action to take place.  Did I say it was boring?  Oh, yes, it was boring.  &#34;Hellraiser IV in Space&#34; was ten times scarier and I remember lauging in that movie.  In this one, I was just waiting....waiting....waiting....looking at the crowd....waiting....the movie is over.  What?  Wait a minute?  Where's the end?  What was scary?  What happened?  Nobody screamed in the audience the whole time.  There was a lot of cursing and calling BS at the credits.We went to get our money back from the manager but he refused since we sat through the entire movie.  Wasted time that you can never forget.  It's been 15 years and I still remember that night for all that it wasn't.  I remember that it was a hot movie for about 10 days until everyone figured out that it was junk.  Marketing was genius though. Some movies are so bad they are good, like Evil Dead II or Leprechaun, but this was just bad without the camp to make fun of.  Kind of like politicians.	1.0	Great hype, but that's all it was.	2014-03-18	0	0	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A37IQMAET37NZT	Melissa Shawver	As a great horror movie fan who has seen literally hundreds of scary movies, this one ranks as one of the best. Admittedly, it's not a conventional horror movie, and you have to watch it with that in mind.  People today are so used to seeing gore and outrageous, grotesque special  effects in movies that they've come to expect it, and don't really know how  to take a movie that makes you rely on imagination and implied fear of the  unknown instead. This movie is unexpected and different in every way, from  it's unusual format (shaky, home video-like scenes) to it's abrupt and  terrifying ending. In short, you won't have the evil spelled out for you  and presented in 3-D technicolor all over the screen; you have to conjure  it from your imagination, and if you lack the imagination required for  this, you won't enjoy it. There are no slick computer digital enhancements  or neat special effects, the film is designed to look like something that a  couple amateur college kids filmed in the woods. This film presented a kind  of slow, subtle terror that is more likely to happen in real life. That's  probably the problem with most people who hate the movie; it's too  realistic. In real life all of our conversations aren't snappy and witty,  we get into petty, boring arguments with each other, and things are less  flashy than they are in movies. To me, this just makes the movie more  &quot;real&quot; and terrifying.	5.0	All Fear, No Frills	2000-07-11	31	26	5

Fields	To all of those folks out there that walked out of the theater wanting their money back because they didn't see a witch or blood or people being torn limb from limb, WAKE UP!  In order for this movie to terrify you, you have to have an alert and productive mind.  Remember Psycho?  Did you actually see the lady in shower get stabbed?  Did you see buckets of blood?  Of course not but it scared you just the same.The Blair Witch Project used the same tactics.  Three people wander off to get film on a legend that they've heard.  The town of Burketsville had an unusually high death rate of young children for a time.  After interviwing some of the locals, the film crew decides to venture into the woods to find the shack that the so-called Blair Witch was using.  The crew gets lost and has to spend the night in the woods where something appears to be following them.  Trying to descibe this film any further than that just wouldn't be helpful to you at this time.  It is a story that reveals itself in the visual, not just auditorially.What could be scarier than being lost in the woods at night?  The scariest things you can imagine are in your own mind.  That's why kids are afraid of the dark.  Their minds are young, fertile and active.  They don't even know what they're afraid of, they just are.  This film uses that same principle.Our minds have become lazy from having everthing being presented to it on a silver platter.  No time to think, just keep feeding it images so it doesn't have to do any work on it's own!I don't think I've ever seen a more frightening movie and I've seen them all.  I love horror and I'm always fascinated by the many different ways that Hollywood comes up with to scare us.  Granted at this point, most horror these days is just is some madman running around slashing teenagers or weirdo cults worshipping satan.  No imagination.

I don't blame people for warming up to something different than the standard slasher [junk]..., but ""Blair Witch"" rips off almost verbatim two similiar films, one from the 1970s called Cannibal Holocaust (see earlier review), and another which came out about a year before ""BW"" which was set in New Jersey (around the famous ""Jersey Devil"" legend) and has an almost identical plotline. You can rent this film, whose name escapes me, at Hollywood Video... It HAS been done before. That's number one. Number two is that gimmickery aside (and most of the appeal of this film was that so many people were duped, for a short while, into believing it might have been real), this isn't a very scary movie. It's somewhat disturbing, particularly if you have ever been lost in the woods and started to wonder if you'd ever get out, but I can't recall being scared. Probably because I wished Heather would either shut ... up or get killed off by the Blair Witch. Her incessant shrilling is first amusing, then annoying, then aggravating, and then finally unbearable. The flick has its moments, and I must give major props to how it was packaged and marketed, but packaging and marketing gimmicks don't make a good movie. Contrary to what I've read, BW is NOT a ""love it or hate it film."" It isn't powerful enough in either a good or bad sense to be loved OR hated. My personal reaction?

I will not disparage those that liked it, I just question why? WHY?  There is a poular movie out called &quot;Ten Things I Hate About You.&quot;  My  review is &quot;Ten Things I hate About Blair Witch Project&quot; 1.  The  Hype 2.  The fact that the amount of money it cost to make ($38,000) and  the amount it made ($130 Million?) is trumpeted from every mountain top.  I  don't care how much it cost to make or how much it made, it was a bad  movie. 3.  The shaky camera work.  I know, I know, it had to be like that  in order to insure realness, but it gave me headaches and feelings of car  sickness.  4.  The girl in the film.  How annoying can one human being be?  I wanted the two guys to feed her to the Blair Witch. 5.  The way the  producers tried to play up the angle that the Blair Witch was real.  I hope  this does not offend anyone, but only a UFO watcher who wears garlic  necklaces would believe that the movie was a true story. 6.  The movie's  overbearing fans.  The movie's fans are offended by anyone who didn't like  the film.  They should be offended by their own taste in movies. 7.  The  cheesiness of the &quot;witch scenes.&quot;  They were not scary and the  little witch symbols in the trees which were supposed to be eerie were  boring. 8.  The bandwagon critics.  Every critic and their sister gave this  movie a good review for fear of being &quot;Hollywood Establishment.&quot;  Critics always give dumb, boring movies good reviews because the movie has  some new concept.  New and novel does not always translate to good. 9.  The  Ending.  This ending is novel and new?  Who didn't predict the ending and  who doesn't see a &quot;must see&quot; sequel coming soon to a theater near  you? 10.  I might have been over ambitious in my stating that I have ten  things that I hated about this movie.  Sorry, but nine reasons should be  enough to persuade you to miss this movie.	1.0	BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD.	2000-01-31	6	4	2
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3TP9XZGEKYJI5	Michael J Meisch	Clearly the reviews on this page are quite polarized. That is good; it makes for interesting reading. What I find objectionable, however, is the opinion of a snobbish few who feel that if you did not like this film, then  1)you must be an unthinking person who needs to have things explained to  you; 2) you have no imagination; or 3) you are an MTV-type who prefers  slash-and-dash gore to &quot;real&quot; horror. Such remarks only betray  the reviewers' naivety.Any avid movie goer can think of a few titles that  can be appreciated for their artistic merits (acting, set direction, etc.)  even if he left the theater thinking that the film he just watched was  boring as hell.(&quot;The English Patient&quot; comes to mind.) But that is  the problem with BWP. If you weren't thoroughly scared out of your  Fruit-of-the-Looms, as so many claimed to be, then what else can you find  commendable about this film, save perhaps its originality?Admit it, people;  there are many sophisticated film goers who appreciate all genres-yes,  including Horror-and who followed the story-line of BWP quite well, and who  understood what was going on in the final scene, but nonetheless felt that  the movie was decidedly unscary. And as I said, if you weren't  &quot;creeped-out&quot;, what could you like about it?As a final thought, I  feel that BWP would have been a better film if it would not have tried so  hard to convince us that the story was real. I realize that this was a  marketing ploy (and quite a successful one), but intelligent audiences  aren't duped by that schtick, and they often are turned off by attempts to  do so. I say keep the documentary syle, of course, but instead of using a  shaky video camera, use state-of-the-art camera work. If done well, we  would still be able to put ourselves in the midst of the fated trio, and we  would be spared the motion sickness that ruined the experience for many of  us.	1.0	Keep repeating to yourself, &quot;This is not a movie.&quot;	1999-11-29	0	0	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A13F4GRSFOY9A3	"Michael Kane ""Nitpickflicks"""	"Like a lot of people, I wasn't exactly terrified by TBWP.  What got me into the theater to see it was the brilliant marketing used to promote it, i.e., the web site and the Sci-Fi Channel ""documentary"" that, except in a few places, was as credible as the many UFO documentaries that have become a cable TV staple.However, one level at which the movie does work is probably understandable only to those who have spent time in the deep woods, especially at night.  In a way, the movie capitalizes on the sense that ""something"" is out there, and that that something is a lot scarier than a bear.  I can remember, as a child, our family spending summers in a house deep in the woods of northern Maine, and the creepiness of looking out the windows into the pitch blackness at night, just knowing that if I looked long enough, something would look back.  In fact, one time something did look back; it was a raccoon that was after the trash on the porch.  Those beady little eyes scared the hell out of me, at least until I realized that this foul creature was after old hot dog wrappers and banana peels, and not me.I think this movie succeeds in concept more than in execution.  It is very, very difficult to translate that dark-woods feel to a crowded theater, and, although the gore-dripping garbage that passes for most horror films nowadays bores me to a stupor -- except when it contains Jessica Biel in tight hip-huggers -- TBWP could probably have benefitted from something more than a few tied up sticks and a small pile of stones.  Maybe a barely-seen, disembodied face among the trees?  Film, is, after all, a visual medium, and the -- as I recall, largely improvised -- dialogue of TBWP does little to invoke real terror.  In fact, the director would have been well-advised to ask his three actors to lay off using quite so many F-bombs; really, there are other words in the English language that can convey anger, fear, or whatever, just as well.  C'mon folks, are we that limited?  Let's get a new word!My advice is to watch this flick alone at night, in a cabin far from home, with your (damned) cell phone turned off.  In that setting, it might work a bit better.  The final sequence was nightmarish enough to make the viewing worthwhile.  In fact, I can't help wondering if some of the folks who found the whole thing boring might not benefit from going back to some older horror movies that took their time, building dread, instead of hacking people to pieces during the opening credits.(None of my criticism of gore, by the way, should be construed as in any way casting aspersions on the Evil Dead movies.  Those are examples of how fun a well-made, intense, and blood-soaked carnival ride can be when it doesn't take itself too seriously.)"	2.0	Something of a metaphor	2006-07-19	4	1	3

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	ATNX84AGYIN39	"Michael Roffman ""pinball wizard"""	The film itself is exhilerating. I sat in the theater biting my nails in horror. I sat down with my friends to watch the VHS filled with excitement, and recently sat down to induldge myself in the DVD capabilities of the  film. I was both happy and in dismay. By saying added footage or new  footage I thought maybe we'd see muh more than a conversation in a tent.  With the 24 houers of footage they had, couldn't they have dug up something  a little more...fun. The features are dull with only the Curse of the Blair  Witch. The menu itself is great withb rocks as your menu icons. I do give  the directors credit, but for a film of such controversy and hype...you'd  figure the DVD would be compelling. It was not. The film which has heather  Donahue, Michael Williams, and Josh Leonard venture into the Burkittsville  woods is probably the most tense experience I've felt since 1978's  Halloween. If I was told this was real, I would very well believe it. The  dialogue and acting is very real and persuading. If you buy the DVD for  features, you'll be upset. You buy the DVD for the film, then that's up to  you. To me, I think this DVD is worth seeing. Buying, yes. But only if you  have a DVD-ROM where maybe 25 percent of the features go to. Other than  that, wait till maybe a three pack of all the Blair Witch films come out.	4.0	The DVD Project	2000-06-29	1	0	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A33065VK2M1DGE	Michael Russell	"Not only is The Blair Witch Project one of the best films of 1999, it's also one of the smartest, scariest horror movies ever made. It tells the story of three student film-makers who hike deep into the Maryland woods to shoot a documentary about the legendary Blair witch who is known by the townspeople to have killed several children in the area for two centuries. The three young students are never seen again, but their terrifying footage is found a year later and we, the audience, get to see the mysterious, harrowing last days of their known lives.At first the doomed project is more like a whimsical outing. Heather (Heather Donahue) is the bossy director; Mike (Michael Williams) is the wisecracking soundman; and Josh (Joshua Leonard) is the laid back cinematographer. The three actually seem to be having fun until they get lost...and find ominous ritualistic symbols hanging in the trees...and see and hear strange, frightening things in the night...To say anymore than that would spoil a movie that must actually be seen to be believed. It is captivating, tense, and brilliantly scary.The performances are very credible especially Donahue who was unjustly voted Worst Actress at the Annual Raspberry Awards. She has a knockout anti-climatic speech towards the end of the film that provides her character with some much-needed vulnerability under her strong-willed stubbornness.The film was a monstrous financial success especially considering the $10,000 budget. It created a huge Blair witch hype over the Internet and spawned a sequel in 2000. The writers/directors (Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez) obviously understood that our imaginations are a terrifying thing. A lot of the time what is never seen can be the scariest thing in the world. One thing's for sure, camping will never be the same again.Rated R for very strong language and some very scary innuendos.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A11GA97G43LSK0	Michael Sutton	I'm not going to waste time on insulting people who don't like this film, although I think they are simply standing outside, shouting at the rain.However, I would like to clear up a few misconceptions that seem to have  arisen.1. The entire film makes sense IF - and it's a big if - you watch  carefully and listen closely. I know most people don't like having to  concentrate on a film, but in this case it is vital. In fact, the entire  last ten minutes are explained by the first ten minutes - especially the  wonderful final moments; one of the most haunting images I've seen for a  long time.2. The camerawork is shaky for a number of reasons. Firstly,  neither Josh nor Heather have experience in using this equipment; at one  point, Josh explicitly states that he has used the camera once before.  Secondly, Heather's enthusiasm for recording gets the better of her and she  begins filming everything regardless of content or quality. Thirdly, the  equipment is heavy and they are tramping around rough ground. Fourthly, by  the middle of the film, much of the filming takes place while the  characters are in a state of panic.3. The swearing. Get over it - these  are characters who adopt a certain type of speech, which is, in my  experience of teaching teenagers, totally realistic.4. This is not a  true story, and frankly, anyone who is gullible enough to think it is  deserves a very rude wake-up call indeed. It is a very clever pastiche of a  certain style of film making, but it has precedents - notably Woody Allen's  &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot;, which was similarly criticised for its  shaky camerawork and excessive profanity.5. No, it is not the scariest  film ever made - that is called hype and is best ignored. Anyone  approaching _any_ film expecting it to be the scariest thing ever made is  setting themselves up for a disappointment. I found it deeply unnerving and  quite disturbing, although more so on a second viewing oddly enough. But we  all have our own ideas of what is frightening and I doubt there is a gold  standard of terror which will _always_ be effective. If you can't mentally  step inside a film and allow yourself to go along with it, BWP is entirely  the wrong sort of film for you.I've been watching horror films for more  years than I care to remember, and BWP is the most exciting discovery I've  made for a very long time.The premise is not unique, but the way it is used  is quite masterly.	5.0	A superb film	1999-10-30	2	2	0

Ever since this cheap, low budget film was released, it inspired producers everywhere that cheap/low budget/and bad ideas can be make a quick buck.When I first heard about this movie, there was a humongous rave about it, I wasnt intrested in the movie, but got dragged along anyway.... while watching the movie I was not the slightest bit scared, everything was bad, and nothing was sacry. Then when the movie finished, i think everyone had the same thought going through there head as me ""Is that it? Is that the end? huh?""The movie got more hype then it deserved too! First they said it was a true story, and it was actors reinacting the tapes found. Then they admitted it wasnt 100% accuret, there where a few scenes added to the movie to make it scaryier, like the tent shaking...then they admited that the whole thing was 100% fictional!!!!! so they had to lie to get this garbage veiwed!!!I have only heard people say that the thing that scares them about the movie is it now makes them afraid to walk in the woods alone.. and claim that the movie was brilliant for achieving that idea.... i guess they never saw Friday the 13th???I know alot of you love this movie. And you will hate the fact that i love Book Of Shadows, but hate this movie!!! But its my opinion, and I respect everyone elses opinion, so i hope youll accept mine. Thats the way I fell about this movie that i beleive is part of the reason Tv is infested with RTV these days.But, with every bad, there is a good.... it did inspire a few great parodys and sketchs in other films and tv stuff.However, I also did inspire a copy cat type of film that i didnt think was too bad called ""the last broadcast"" check that out if you like these type of movies."	1.0	The begining of reality TV	2004-04-29	14	7	7
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3ITF6QNR581AR	Micheal O Mealoid	Usually people just review what they really enjoy but, like confession, I reckon doing a review of something you didn't enjoy is probably good for the soul.The hype surrounding this film was absolutely immense, and nothing could live up to it.  But I found this film particularly disappointing.  Usually I don't like scary or horror films (life is scary enough, don't you think?) but I made an exception here, since it sounded like something special.Unfortunately, the film turned out to be exactly what it was, a low budget amateur film made by students.  The film quality was poor (OK, so it was meant to be, but did it have to be that bad?), the sound quality was terrible (they could have improved this and not seriously compromised the &quot;film verit&eacute;&quot; aspect, surely?), and the choice of shots was a bit repetitive (again, I suppose they were meant to be lost, going over the same ground again and again, but why so many extended shots of leaves?).  As for the end, surely we could have been given a bit more to go on?I certainly applaud the film-makers for making such a popular film on a very low budget, but I'm afraid it didn't do a lot for me.  Personally I didn't feel any atmosphere in the film, I didn't feel any mounting despair or desperation, and I never managed to really empathise with the characters as they got more and more lost.  That said, I was quite impressed with the scene in the woods when they come across all the figures made of sticks, but that was the best bit in the whole film.I think what is really essential in liking this film is to be able to suspend your disbelief and really believe that it is a genuine film of a bunch of students who got lost (apparently some people really did think it was genuine, but I reckon the credits at the end probably gave it away!).  For some reason I just wasn't able to do that with this film.Overall, top marks to the makers for making a ton of money, but for the shaky shots, rustling leaves, bad sound, etc., nil points.	1.0	Sadly disappointing, didn't live up to the hype.	2000-10-06	15	10	5

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2HZIE6EC3F3N9	Mike	Well, here's comment # 1,012.  Maybe I shouldn't even bother.I'll try to refrain from repeating or responding to the billions of things said before, except to add myself to the list of those who recognize this as one  of the few really unusual and compelling &quot;horror&quot; movies made in  our time (sometimes I think that genre is on its last legs).For concise,  articulate rebuttals to most of the standard criticisms, scroll down to the  Oct. 30 comments and read the one from fr.merrin@virgin.net.A few  observations that I haven't seen made much:This is a movie that's  misunderstood or misdescribed even by a lot of people who like it.  Fans  often say little more than &quot;I was so scared I chewed my left thumb  off,&quot; or variations thereon.  But to describe it as &quot;scary&quot;  in the usual sense and leave it at that isn't wholly accurate.  &quot;Unnerving&quot; is the word I prefer.  The ghost story parts probably  freaked me out less than the more ordinary situation of being lost in the  middle of nowhere with people you don't trust to help you out.  BWP is  about things that go bump in the night, but equally it's about people  starkly confronting their real strengths and weaknesses and the puniness of  their civilized props, including their reliance on other people.I  think that's partly at the root of the many frustrated complaints about how  &quot;whiny&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;unlikeable&quot; the  characters supposedly are.  Heather, Josh and Mike react like real, scared  kids, not heroes.  Where most mainstream horror movies end up as fables  about the triumph of ingenuity over darkness, BWP is a fable about  helplessness.And even critics who praised it tended to talk about it  as just a great gimmick.  It's much more than that (although it's that,  too).  BWP reshapes standard movie storytelling.  Normally we view a movie  from the safe viewpoint of a pair of invisible eyes floating around the  action.  For virtually every second of BWP, I am effectively the eyes of  the characters; this stuff feels like I'm not just watching it happen, but  that it's happening TO me.  If something comes out of the dark, I won't  watch it come after someone - it will come after ME.  Filmmakers have known  for ages how such point-of-view shots work to scare people;  Sanchez/Myrick's daring inspiration was to stretch the tactic for the whole  running time, and to find a way to do it convincingly.Closely connected  to all of the above are the long stretches of more or less blank screen  that people mock so often.  Humans are very visually-oriented creatures,  never more so than when we're watching movies, where we expect to be shown  most everything we need to know.  BWP sabotages my vision at key moments of  unease or &quot;danger,&quot; when I want it most; so, it forces me to  concentrate with rare intensity on the SOUND, an element we usually don't  consciously notice, taking it for granted as background to the visuals.  Deprived of my eyes, I turn to my ears as a crutch, listening for the  information I need to be assured of my &quot;safety.&quot;  Even then, my  crutch is shaky, since the sounds are so uncertain.  It's an intensified,  extended version of those panicky seconds when you're lying in the dark,  hear a noise and fumble blindly for the lamp switch in spite of the logical  part of your brain telling you to chill out.That's what one film critic,  Michael Atkinson, meant when he said the movie &quot;blinds us and sets us  running in the dark.&quot;  He observed that BWP is about the limitations  of our senses, the ultimate futility of our illusion that we can control  what we can see.  As such, it also calls into question the standard way we  watch movies.To all who read my whole comment, thanks, and you can go  now.  Given all the static around this film, I really wanted to explain why  BWP, for many of us, is unsettling in a way that goes deeper than mere  goosebumps.  I don't expect to convert any detractors -- your reaction is  your reaction-- but I hope to make people think a little more before  turning up their noses at the movie's more unusual and difficult elements.	5.0	REPEAT: If u ain't seen it, U SHOULDN'T BE READING ABOUT IT!	1999-12-31	13	10	3
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3OHQXFNL2W826	Mike	"With four years to reflect on my Blair Witch Project experience, I offer that BWP is a success on 3 levels:1. Directors Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick prove that so much can be achieved with so little, working on a budget of a mere $50,000 (infinitesimal by hollywood standards).2. BWP proves that the unseen/unknown is much more frightening than what the eyes can see.3. The script, or lack thereof, being largely improvisational, adds a genuineness of spontaneity that could not have been achieved if the actors had simply memorized lines.BWP does everything right, right from the get-go.  I will never forget how quiet the theater became when the opening text appeared on the screen.  You could have heard a mouse fart.  The lack of a musical score set the tone for the entire film.  The genius of BWP is that the ""horror"" is insidious, invisible, subtle, and evil.  As the directors may or may not have intended, you don't even realize you're scared until it's too late, and honestly, a musical soundtrack would have detracted from such a creepy atmosphere.Heather's video apology letter sends a chill down your spine from its naked poignancy.  You feel as though you are the one holding the camera, your fate as uncertain as hers.The ending leaves you with mixed emotions.  On the one hand, it leaves you disappointed and angry that you don't actually get to see what happens to Mike and Heather.  On the other hand, you are glad that you don't get to see it, that you are spared the terror and implied violence that surely befalls the two students.  The fact that the ending is open to your interpretation truly is one of the major elements that makes the film so effective.  Another is the fact that it takes you a long time to shake some of the movie's images from your head.  Who can forget the bloody stumps left outside the tent, Heather's tear-filled apology letter, or Mike standing in the corner of the abondoned house as Heather screams at him.  Why is he standing there?  Why is he facing the wall?  What happens next?...which goes back to the idea that what you can't see, and what you don't know is scarier than what you can see, and what you do know.  I've owned the video cassette of this movie since the fall of 1999, and have yet to gather the nerve to watch it alone.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1JMQ88IMH0XJL	Mike	"""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999)I still really don't know what to think about this film. I've watched it about 3 times, and I liked it all the times I viewed it, but somehow this film continuously leaves me muddled. I don't know whether to think this movie is a bunch of baloney about people running around with cameras scaring each other or whether it's a true scare-fest with excellent ideas and a great premise. I think I'd go with the second one, but there were elements of the first one that put the movie down a little for me grade-wise.The premise and whole filming idea for The Blair Witch Project was excellent. It added more to the atmosphere and it proved that what we can't see is much scarier. You don't get much blood, guts and gore, but what you do get is a really creepy setting, tonnes of scary rocks and some fantastic acting to make the scenarios real.On the subject of acting, I am very shocked that Heather Donahue got a Razzie for this film. I thought she was really great in the movie. Donahue is the leader of the cast and takes the material seriously, and she is her character - she's very frightened and believable in her role. Michael and Joshua are also very good, but Donahue is the movie's heart and soul, and she is exceptionally right into her character. I mean, she doesn't deserve an Oscar or anything, but a Razzie? No way!I also liked the idea of the movie how they used the actors real names. Somehow it made it a little more believable and I think the actors got into the characters a little bit more because they could base it on themselves. This film does have a lot of great idea and premises, such as one I've just mentioned, but some scenes are unnecessary and you might get a little tired of the constant swearing and screaming and joking, instead of getting in touch with the more scary side of the film.None-the-less, I still enjoyed the movie. I don't think many people realise how sometimes this movie brings across some warmth and quite a bit of character development, like in one scene the group talk about what they like to do on a Sunday morning (""go for a walk in the woods,"" says Donahue, following it up with ""not anymore!"") and what they'd love to eat at the current time of their loss in the woods. The movie also has a reasonably funny map scene.But, in the end, The Blair Witch Project is all about terror and scaring the audience, and they succeed in this. Just so you know, this is not another slasher teen movie like I Know What You Did Last Summer or Scream. This is raw, real, terror and you'll be clutching your pillow with fright. The final scene in particular is one of the most frightening sequences I've ever seen on film. All in all, this is a very original piece that will be remembered for a long time after viewing, and I recommend it to those who like something new in horror films.MY GRADE: B+"	4.0	Original concept and very eerie	2002-04-08	4	3	1

Ebert notes it has considerable entertainment value but lists it's importance in technical terms for being influential.Being the first indie blockbuster, made for 24k and shot with inexpensive hand held cameras and grosses more than $150 million.He says ""the message was inescapable in the next century, technology will place the capacity for feature filmaking into the hands of anyone who is sufficiently motivated, and audiences will not demand traditional ""production values"" before parting with their money"".Now the entertainment value, i remember an internet buzz about this movie and rumors that it was real.  I saw it in Boston when it first came out when the potential this stuff really happend was talked about.  For me personally what you don't see can be scarier then what you do see, most people will imagine things far worse than they are and the fear of the unknown is one of the deepest fears.  I don't need a big digitized ghost to scare me, a noise in the woods, the dark, a baby crying, something chasing you, you shutting a window and turning around and it's open, things like that are freaky subtle things.I don't know about other kids growing up but me and my friends would always go to freaky places like the three kids in The Blair Witch Project do, so right there i can see me and my friends hearing about some local myth and going to check it out for fun.  The documentary style looks real and feels real again i can relate.  A movie like Alien is great i actually love that movie but to be terrified and put myself in there situation I'd have to be an astronaut on a spaceship in the future and while doing that I'd be watching Alien with the crew, then yea before i went to bed Id be on edge.Also the acting i don't know how it can be criticized it's almost like they weren't even acting and they were feeling whatever emotions they were feeling in the film for real.Like i said people love this or hate it, with 1800 reviews half being 5's the other half being 1's.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A17G7WJKAJVKQW	"Mike ""Mike"""	Despite the fact that this little movie was grossly over-hyped, it still delivers on what it promises:  a visually fresh and psychologically scary odyssey into the unknown.  While combining an ultra-modern  documentary-style filmmaking technique with the old-fashioned &quot;less is  more&quot; philosophy, the filmmakers have succeeded in making something  original and genuinely frightening.Although I didn't think it was  totally terrifying, I do feel it was suspensful and scary enough.  The real  appeal is the exploration in human psychology, as we see the breakdowns  that fear, disorientation, and physical discomfort can cause.  The young  actors did a great job portraying their emotions, and hopefully they will  move on from here.I recommend this movie to genre buffs and curious fans  alike.  It is satisfying and fun.	4.0	Stylish and Scary	2000-05-22	2	0	2

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AKJ9MEE93DG5O	mitchell5954	The Blair Witch Project is the first found-footage film to get a considerable amount of hype behind it, and is also the film that kick-started the found-footage genre we have today.  Did the film live up to all the hype behind it?  To many people it didn't live up to it.  This film is one of the more polarizing films I've ever seen.  In my opinion, the film did not live up to the hype, but I still thought it was a decent film.  I thought it was great that they could do so much with a little budget and no special effects.  I liked the characters save one and I felt their plight.The story is as follows.  Three college students, Heather, Michael, and Josh, are making a documentary on the Blair Witch Legend.  They interview a few people who know the legend and some even claim to have seen the witch.  Then they go into the woods to look for more evidence but end up getting lost.  They soon learn that there is someone following them.  Is it the Blair Witch or is it just a crazy person?  Whoever it is it starts hunting them down one at a time.This film does do a lot right.  It has a very interesting legend behind it.  The start of the film is the main characters interviewing people about the Blair Witch phenomenon, and the legend surrounding her is quite interesting.  The film also has great atmosphere.  There is a sense of mystery with throughout the film.  Are the stories really real?  Who is hunting the main characters in the woods?  Was it the Blair Witch or just a crazy person?  I like that they did not actually show who is behind this.  Whether they had shown a crazy person or a witch it would have been disappointing and would have ruined the sense of mystery.The lack of special effects really adds to the realism the film is going for.  Too many found-footage films use CGI or some sort of effects and it really does not work.  Found-footage films are meant to give a sense of realism and give the idea that this really happened.  In my opinion this film is the only one to really pull that notion off.I did like most of the characters.  To be more exact I like two out of the three characters that are in the film.  Michael and Josh I thought were liable and funny, and I felt for them when things went wrong.  The girl, Heather, I do not like at all.  She was too pushy, she complains a lot, and she treats Mick and Josh like crap a lot.  Everything always has to go her way or she freaks out.  She brought the movie down quite a bit for me.Overall, I thought The Blair Witch Project is a decent experiment.  It was not an amazing film as it was hyped up to be but I think it is still good.  Whether you love it or hate it the film did have a huge impact on the movie industry.  It did kick-start the found-footage genre for better or worse.  I would say it is definitely worth at least one viewing.	3.0	Not Great, but Definately not Horrible as Many People Say!	2013-09-17	0	0	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3IMNZSYDOTTU6	"M. Jarrett ""SoundgardenFanForLife"""	"When THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT hit the internet blitz back when it was first commandeered, the hype was huge...everybody wanted to see it before it even hit the theaters. The fact that it only cost about $40k to make and made over $200 million worldwide is a testament to the power of this film. The cheap budget and documentary style camera work actually made the film a lot scarier than it really would have been had it been filmed as a straight-ahead horror film. The scares are plenty in this...those scenes at night are frightening, and your imagination can only create the terror that they are experiencing. The three actors picked in the movie (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael C. Williams) are all very convincing in their roles. This was just so dark, so threatening a movie. At the end of the movie, when they find the ""witch's"" house, the terror piles on until the last shot when Heather's camera hits the ground and she is implied to have been ""knocked out"" by something, and the fact you never see it is very terrifying. You won't sleep for months after watching this, but some of you won't have any trouble if horror is your slice of bread.BLAIR WITCH PROJECT did what no other horror movie did...there were no zombies; there were no ghosts; there were no serial killers; the horror in this movie is all implied. It makes it very scary, downright threatening, and very suspenseful. It's no wonder the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT became a huge hit. You won't think of the woods in the same way after seeing this movie...never again...anyone want to go camping?"	4.0	'Blair Witch' a new kind of horror...	2005-10-20	4	3	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1ATDXRQ50NSJU	"""mlittlehi"""	Many people won't like this movie, there's no doubting that, but anyone who refuses to sit down and accept the film the way it was made will never be able to appreciate it's beauty. Honestly, I didn't find it that scary,  not until the final scene, but where everything leading up to the ending  lacked in horror for me, it made up in the sheer psychological torture  displayed by the incredible cast.The Blair Witch Project isn't a movie,  it's more like a peice of art. If you have the correct perspective of it,  even if it didn't make you scared it will disturb you, or at least bother  you, and then you will look back at it and admire it, as I did. The amazing  acting and the incredible cinematography, coupled with the most innovative  plot ever created (right next to The Matrix) results in one of the best  movies of 1999, and it makes me proud to be a fan of horror films.	5.0	The best psychological horror film ever made.	2000-02-10	5	2	3

But based on what I heard (about everybody loving it) and what I saw (the trailers).  I went to see this movie and I  was blown away.  Going in the first time I had no idea it was staged.  I  was so scared I could barely walk out of the theater.  I saw it 3 times and  even though I had heard the truth about the movie after the first showing I  was still scared every time I saw it.

I also live in Maryland by the way.

If you enojyed any of the Paranormal Activity movies you might enjoy this. Unfornately (or maybe fortunately for me) I didn't find the Blair Movie scary and thus entertaing since besides the noises, and what not, and the panicking of the actors just like in the Paranormal Activity movies there's not much else going on.

Opinions about a film have never been so extreme, either people hated it, felt dizzy due to the constant moving camera and grainy pictures, and did not see what the fuss was all about, or many have seen it as a masterpiece, a film full of tension, original and fresh ideas, and a cinematic experience that does not happen too often these days.I am of the latter group.I saw BWP, to be honest because of the hype surrounding it, but having said that, I really did not have prejudgements, only a 'let us watch and see' attitude. I have to admit that what I saw was a chilling and disturbing horror film.As a result I was quite disappointed with the very low marks and negative feedback that came from many,clearly missing the point and the atmosphere of the film completely.One criticism of this group is that they were never scared at all in this 'supposedly' horror film.Well what makes a horror film I wonder?The genre has evolved greately since the days of Boris Karloff and giant spiders, and while films like The Haunting and Night of Living Dead have started the psychological horror genre, buliding tension, unseen or/and determined evil, films like Halloween have revolutionized the genre, which resulted in many imitations to this day, where the tension and brilliant camera work and music helped to grab the viewer's attention and senses till the very last frame. The Omen and the Exorcist went a bit further and used the supernatural, biblical evil to tickle the imagination and fear of movie goers everywhere.Of course, the genre took another path as well, the path of gore.And the seventies were awash with blood and spalsh movies, like Argento's films, relying on the viewer's eyes, shock images and repulsion to induce the required reaction.Each sub genre had its champions, and while in the eighties and most of the nineties, horror films experienced a creative crisis, in comes filmmakers with fresh ideas to revive it, most recently we saw The Others, and The Ring/Ringu and of course The Blair Witch Project.The BWP uses cleverly the supernatural, unseen evil, and relies on building up the tension gradually until the climatic ending, the Donohue's 'I am too scared to open my eyes, too scared to close them' speech, which in my opinion is one of the most chilling scenes ever filmed.Another criticism of the BWP is that it looks like a film student excercise. Well in a way it is, for all involved are amateurs working on a flimsy budget, but if it is so, then I it is a brilliant student excercise!What I found very clever, is the set, the woods, take a life of their own. Like the hotel in Shining, it comes alive, breathes heavily down the character's necks, and carries with it many secrets,both innocent and sinister.This film does not really mean to make you jump in your seat like some well used horror stunt, and does not aim at your visual, more basic, stimulis.It is rather a gripping anxiety and tension filled ride aimed at your brain.In BWP, the characters are trapped from the beginning, and you can feel that they are doomed from the start.What you watch throughout the film is how and when and not if they will all persih.There is no gore in the film. If you are a fan of this subgenre then, of course you will be disappointed.If you like intelligent films then you should watch BWP with fresh unjudgemental eyes.If you are not scared by what you see, then probably horror  movies are not for you.Yet if you like these type of films, the BWP is certainly one of the best, if anything only because at last we have independant filmmakers with vision and a love of their craft, something which is so desperately needed in any genre.	5.0	Not Only a Hype!	1999-11-01	0	0	0

The connections were supposed to be made mentally  through a series of plot points. There was NO SCRIPT, the whole movie was  ad-libbed with just these plot points to work from. Bad acting? What the  hell do you mean bad acting? These people were being themselves. They were  just as tired, hungry, and irritated as the lost characters that they  played, especially since Myrick and Sanchez basically sent them into the  woods with two cameras and let them know where the movie was going and  where food could be found from post-it notes on trees.The film has also  been accused of having no character development. What are you thinking? Did  Heather need to scream &quot;OKAY! WE'RE LOST AND JOSH IS PROBABLY  DEAD!&quot; for you to understand that she had finally come to terms with  being wrong? How obvious did it need to be?The film was innovative,  original, and above all, UN-Mainstream. Furthermore, I'm sickened by people  who say, &quot;You didn't even see the witch...&quot; That has to prove my  point that most people were expecting something. To expect anything from  this movie would ruin it's psychological effect.One thing that DID  bother me was having Mike admit to kicking to map into the river. It would  have been better if nobody had said anything and then, when they found  Josh's teeth (or whatever those were), have THEM wrapped up in the  map.Anyway, I liked this movie.Movieboy	5.0	You People Make Me Sick	1999-12-19	22	17	5

I saw this film when it first came out and I watched it again recently just to refresh my memory. The biggest problem with this film is it wants to be seen as a real experience but, NEWSFLASH!...........it's not! They try to scare you by you accepting this is real and it just doesn't work. This reminded me of my youth and going to the woods and trying to freak each other out,... well, I don't freak out easily, maybe if a bear was growling nearby but, not by the ""Jersey Devil"" which was the folklore in my hometown creeping around. Another problem with this film, is the noises that the young actors hear are so low you can hardly hear anything except the screaming of the youths themselves. Even the ending which has some mild eeriness is really nothing and it's only about a minute long. This movie would grant an A for trying to be different, if I were a teacher giving my student a grade but, as a horror movie this is pretty forgettable. There is no way this should be considered one of the scariest movies of all time!"	2.0	A COOL CONCEPT BUT, SERIOUSLY FLAWED MOVIE!	2008-02-09	22	15	7
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1FY6ETS4ZPCUE	Mr. Mambo	Masterful concept movie by a couple of real shrewd young guys which takes the country by storm. I loved the following:1. Grainy video all the way through, no production values, no sharp photography, so low-budget it looks homemade;2. No monsters or witches shown;3. Very subtle night sounds create more horror than anything else;4. Night scene in old house has to rate as one of the more terrifying scenes in movie history;5. Bag of bloody teeth, weird stick figures and effigies in trees set a mood of impending doom;6. Great performances by the three main characters; totally believable.This film made buckets of money. The filmmakers pulled a fast one, but they richly deserve every cent they made.Last point: the amount that you hated this film is directly disproportional to your intelligence and sophistication. Translation: if you did not like or appreciate the movie, you are a stupid hayseed; you need to get out more.	5.0	Damn! I Wish I'd Thought of This!	2008-01-17	7	2	5

Carnegie	By now everybody, except those living in caves knows about Blair Witch Project, how it was filmed (shaky camcorder documentary style), what the plot is, how cheap it was to make and how much money it made. This was a very clever idea, very cheaply shot and if you happened to be one of the lucky ones to see this movie before all the hype (about it being the scariest film ever) then you were probably thrilled but sadly it was over-hyped and for everybody who subsequently sees it, it is usually a let-down. It's just not a very scary movie but it is original and it does have a spooky ending which stays with you for days and nights afterwards. All in all though this is a triumph mostly for the internet marketing campaign that made it such a hit, rather than for it's originality, which is a pity. However, it's a pretty good buy at a bargain price (...).	3.0	Clever Idea But Over-Hyped	2001-11-14	0	0	0

That wasn't the case for me.  I think a big part of it was that the movie-theater atmosphere was missing.  Instead of a big, dark and silent room with other people equally entranced...I was in a semi-well-lit condo near a busy street with neighbors thumping around.  I couldn't hear the ""voices"" that kept surrounding the tent.  I'm willing to give this one another shot after a while but my first experience with the film wasn't quite as fabulous as most people claimed."	3.0	Maybe in silence?	2007-10-09	7	5	2

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3EHA16S1OAWT	M. Shanahan	Early on in this film the pressure on the characters is not solely about potential supernatural horrors or possible Deliverance types tracking and messing with them; it is about being lost in the woods, walking for eleven hours and getting nowhere, the fear of going the wrong way, being wet, tired and hungry and losing confidence that they will get out of it. I have not been lost exactly, but I have been unable to find the track and gone through thick bush instead, turning a thirty minute trip downhill into a 4 hour slog over bad terrain, with the worry that we would not get back to the car by nightfall.  I completely relate to their experience of not seeming to get anywhere after considerable travel, or even being able to tell how much progress one has made, and appreciate that people do get out of their depth in the outdoors.  And you get real hungry and tired carrying a pack all day.  I think the improvised acting does a great job of conveying the mounting frustration, damage to trust, further bad decision making and demoralisation that would occur in their circumstances.A number of the reviews here seem to think nothing much by way of horror happens until the last few minutes, but the whole film is about these people reacting as more and more bad stuff happens. By the time the danger gets more visceral it already seems to them that they are lost and will never get home.	5.0	Lost	2008-06-11	14	11	3

Unfortunately the audience isn't given enough information on the Blair Witch to understand what makes the legend so intriguing.I  can appreciate the way it was filmed.  There were times when it seemed like you were watching an actual documentary rather than a movie.  I can also appreciate that, unlike most films, you are not readily presented with what you are supposed to fear.  A good job was done of presenting an atmosphere.  There was no ""horror movie formula"" being followed, which made the outcome unpredictable.I guess my problem was that I didn't enough of a connection with the characters to care whether they lived or died.  All I saw was two male brats led by an arrogant female brat.  Their favorite word is the ""F"" word.  They have no idea how to navigate  through the woods.  They scream, they yell, they die.

They force laughter out and keep insisting how dumb and how funny the whole thing is.  These  people get annoying.  It takes imagination to let this movie be effective.  You have to remember how damn scary it was to be a kid afraid of the dark.  This is one of the most original movies of the year and the ending was  completely, satisfyingly scary.  The acting by the three leads was very  good, very realistic, and people who complain about the jittery camera have  obviously never seen a home video before.  I'm sick of people ripping on  this movie.  It is a brilliant film, and even if it doesn't scare you, at  least appreciate the fact that it is scaring others, and these people  aren't whimps.  They just know a good movie when they see one.	5.0	spooky, spooky, spooky!	1999-10-22	0	0	0

I've been waiting a long time to write this review, because I know that everyone in the world is debating whether this movie was cheap, overhyped idiocy, or creative, imaginitive, and a very scary film.  The sides are pretty clearly divided.  My first viewing of it in the theater when it first came out was one of the most frightening I've ever had [I saw a midnight showing].  My heart was racing when I saw those children's handprints all over the wall of that house.  The reason it scared me and the reason it didn't scare some people, is because you have to use your imagination.  So it really depends on whether you can do that or not how much it will scare you.  The atmosphere, the isolation, the fear, the slow maddening of these three people... You have to watch this movie as if this were true, these were real people, and this was the footage they recorded.When I bought the movie after it was released on video, I watched it several times, and thats when I began to pick apart the flaws in it (yes, there are moments when their acting is pretty obvious, and you can tell where an adlib had just taken place), Much of that had to do with the fact that the actors and actresses were told to adlib, and basically they tried too hard in some parts.So I can't tell you this is a brilliant film by any means, but if you go along with it, it can be genuinely frightening...	3.0	An innovative and interesting approach to filmmaking, but...	2000-10-30	1	1	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1KEV3H49RQM16	Naveed_2000@yahoo.com, Kyla Austin	This was the most terrifying movie I have ever seen by far.  When it was night on the film and things began to happen, I had tears of fright in my eyes. The way it was shot made it even more frighteningly because it made  you feel like you were there with them.  I thought I was going to have to  leave before it ended for fear of screaming.  I held my boyfriend's hand so  tightly that his knuckles cracked.  I was kept on the edge of my seat but  my boyfriend fell asleep not even half way through it.  People that have  seen the show come in two varieties.  &quot;It was awesome,&quot; or  &quot;it sucked.&quot;  I think that it depends on what scares you most  as a person.  For me it was the unknown, and this movie centered right on  that.	5.0	A Great Show Not To See If You Fear The Unknown And Unseen.	1999-09-07	0	0	0

A group of five of us went to see it on it's first day of release; one emerged from the cinema unimpressed  while the rest were shellshocked by it's brilliance(well I was anyway).  Although perhaps a bit slow to start with, the film is a classy  psychological horror without the tacky in-your-face gore associated with  the modern horror scene. The ending is truly chilling and still has my  heart pounding when I see it now. I would recommend it to anyone who would  appreciate a film that it far from the ordinary.	5.0	A breath of fresh air for 90's horror	1999-12-30	0	0	0

Lopez ""Nerdo"""	Sitting in the darkness at the movie theater or at home, watching with the lights off the Blair Witch Project or should I say not watching the Blair Witch Project since some scenes where not only out of focus but in total  darkness with added dialogue included post production, but I am getting  ahead of myself and giving you the conclusion without even giving you the  damn map.What begins, as pseudo documentary on a myth or fictionalized  story of the Blair Witch project becomes the worst nightmare for the three  characters in the story and yes, we must admit, the audience at large. For  we travel with them to the path to no knowledge, since we do not know what  the director nor the actors want to do with this project... here is a  clue... confuse us and keep us in the dark.What made the film work in  terms of numbers ($$) was the well executed publicity machine provided  thanks to their website. It was the biggest promotional idea since the  discovery of flyers that can be posted anywhere. Millions of Netizens who  gathered on the web (those night owls that apparently have no life)  discovered via the click of their mouse the Blair Witch Project and the  rest was history.The best promotion is the word of mouth and as  curiosity peaks so does the film project at Sundance... which has become a  Pseudo Art Film Festival. Now, back to BWP, this film supposedly works on  the old hat trick of what you do not see scares you. Well, it really  worked, because you cannot see the actors most of the time nor understand  them neither figure out why any of them carried a cell phone? But the worst  scenes in the film are what you do not see... count them: 15 minutes of  darkness interspersed with you sitting out there seeing nothing. Just  project a pitch-black scratch old negative here and there and we have  ourselves ART FILM (Film Noir... Literally).The Blair Witch project  fails in many things, whoever goes to camp without some sort technology,  beeper, cell phone satellite communications... an extra compass, a sense of  direction... well deserves The Blair Witch Hype curse, meaning if you sat  through it and enjoy it... well I feel for you. It is and should stay a  modest student film project that triumph due to its publicity machine and  including greatness on the same sentence with this film is sad and a  disrespect to film makers around the world, I mean it... a film is weigh by  is timeliness... time will tell.

This movie was dull and unentertaining. See it if you  like, but I was throughly dissapointed.	1.0	Completly Over Rated.	1999-09-20	0	0	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z	Octavius	A very bland amateur production where the only suspense is wondering what could be so frightening about this movie. The scariest thing in this movie is how its distribution was allowed when those who produced and marketed this film knew that the camera work and reel speed would make people physically ill. No matter, the blandness of this film is nauseating enough even without the filming gimmick.As for the story itself, one would think that adults exploring for the occult out in the woods would have a little more composure than the way the characters behave in this movie; they appear to be nothing more than a bunch of cub scouts scared to death by some stupid campfire tale. The ending shows nothing and so leaves really nothing to the imagination: what's lacking instead is imagination on the part of those who wrote this frivolous screenplay.Alltogether a very stupid movie about a bunch of skiddish wimps who couldn't find their way out of their own homes. This has to be the most overhyped idiotic 'horror' movie that I have ever seen: even the teen-teaser 'Scream' series had more suspense than this pile of garbage. Finally, as I described before, the film's speed and unbalanced sequences are likely to make some people noxious, so make sure to have a vomit bag in handy: seriously!	1.0	The Bland Witch Project	2004-07-29	30	13	17

You don't have to see the monster or buckets of blood to be creeped out.The ensemble cast is great, but Heather's reactions when it all comes unravelled really make this movie all the more devastating.  Her discovery that they've been travelling in circles, her reaction to the contents of the bundle of sticks outside their tent (screams, handwashing, gloves, trying to put on the backpack), her soliloquy into the camera...it doesn't get any more raw than that.  And to think it was all improvised!  She deserved an Oscar.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A14LSB0DIPVXVM	Otis Johnson	I spent several enjoyable hours with this DVD.  Especially welcome is the altermate sound track on which the writers, directors, et al. provide a running commentary on the making of the film.  Their obviously unrehearsed  comments provide welcome insights into behind the scenes (literally)  events.  Particularly interesting are their thoughts on the three actors.  I won't spoil it for you, but I don't think they care much for  Joshua.Other added elements on the DVD are illuminating as well...I  applaud the inclusion of the Sci-Fi Channel's &quot;Curse of the Blair  Witch&quot; for example.In the end, however, the movie is a bit of a  one- trick pony.  Even given all its cleverness and innovation, this is not  a film I see myself rewatching over the years.  A great rental but not a  keeper.	3.0	Well worth watching...once	1999-12-04	1	1	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	"BWP is an expertly crafted marketing campaign that works on the bases that what you hear in rumour is far better than what it is..... and the hype ends up being a way better than the quality of the movie itself. Apart from the fact that the principle actors and actresses shot the film it is not all that unique. In fact it turns out that BWP was made shortly after the directors watched a film called ""The Last Broadcast"", but they claimed their inspiration came from ""Cannibal Holocaust"". Truth be told, they pilfered the lot from ""The Last Broadcast"" that was made only the year before.So we turn on the news and we hear that 3 actors/actresses are dead and that their film cans have been discovered and a movie called ""The Blair Witch"" will be screening at cinemas shortly and we will all get to hear and see what happened to these people. IMDB even listed the actors/actresses as dead. So the world goes and watches the film and some people get scared and this gets it even more hype.When you put it into the context that non-mainstream movie goers, and mainstream movie goers, who do not watch horror, went to see this film then you can understand why it made them scared. Let's face it - most of these people who where scared could barely name five other horror films that they had seen in the last decade. We also had people walking out of the cinema saying - ""WTF?? Did I just watch?"" and ""Damn that was soooo disappointing."" As a whole, BWP works wonders. BWP is the only horror film that some people have ever sat through, because it was hip to do so. When the hype died down that was the last horror film they would likely ever see. Horror fans rate this one somewhere between ""appalling"" and ""okay"". Very few fans of this genre think that it is a film worthy of 5 or 4 stars or even 3 at matter. I know there are plenty of fans of this genre who would even do the 2 and 1 or spit on it until their throat goes dry.I happen to think that this is great film to show to people who do not regularly watch horror, however if you are in any way familiar with this genre then it is hard to tell what you will think of it. Certainly some scenes are scary, but not all of it and there is lots of nothingness in-between and maybe even lots of - ""who do they think they are fooling with this home video?""The decision is yours. If you can BUY into this film then it will take you away to some awful depths into the back of your mind. If you do NOT BUY into this film then it will take you away to some awful depths in the back of your wallet."	3.0	Better than Picking Navel Lint	2004-01-12	2	0	2

Or a noise of it, or blood, or at least some kind of hint to show that the Blair Witch was there, and the students would meet their doom. That would have made the movie scary at the end (at least for me). It would also leave you with a haunting nag as if to ask: what happened to them. They should have showed something shocking in the house at the end, to make the movie more complete, instead of that ending that just left you confused.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3AJ1X5GT0NBO0	"Parker Lewis ""park-lewis"""	It seems that people these days are looking for a film that will transcend the horror film genre. Unfortunately, this movie does not do that. It's a bummer because the film has a good concept, and they really didn't spend a  lot of money to make this movie, which generally translates to a simple,  straight-to-the-point story. &quot;Halloween&quot; was a low budget film by  John Carpenter, and that created an entire new genre of horror film-the  slasher flick. &quot;Blair Witch&quot;, though, is derivative of several  horror films; and, unfortunately, like a bad robber, it takes all the bad  stuff.Sometimes a movie, especially horror films can be both bad and  good. It can parody some of the bad stuff, and have a good story.  &quot;Scream&quot; did that effectively, not too long ago, and there are  several other examples that mix humor and fright. But &quot;Blair  Witch&quot;, due to its faux-documentary concept, boxes itself in and has  to take itself seriously, and eliminate any campy moments. So, instead the  director allows you to laugh along with the main characters in the  beginning of the movie, in an attempt to get you to acquaint yourself and  possibly relate to these three student filmmakers: director Heather  Donohue, cameraman Joshua Leonard, and soundman Mike Williams.The  characters' names are also the same as the actors, which adds to the  reality factor (or is an indication that these people might screw up and  call each other by their real names). In searching for information on the  legendary Blair Witch, a creature that supposedly kills children in the  nearby Maryland woods, they get themselves lost, and then become desperate  for survival. However, this film fails to reach a connection with its more  critical audience because these characters are very anti-heroic. In many  horror films, you find yourself screaming to the screen, &quot;Don't go  down there!&quot; or &quot;Watch out, behind you!&quot; In this movie, you  find yourself asking, &quot;How is that possible that you are so  dumb?&quot; or worse, &quot;When is someone going to die?&quot; This is  partly due to the fact that the characters are a little annoying, so you  have no sympathy. And second, they really are THAT stupid. (How can you  manage to navigate yourself in a complete circle hiking all day, if you  plan to just go south?  Can't you just use the sun?) If this film had more  intelligent characters, this movie could have worked; of course, then, they  wouldn't have gotten lost in the woods in the first place.Although I  was on the edge of my seat waiting for something to happen, &quot;it&quot;  never really happened, and what I was left with was disappointment, and  nausea, not from being disturbed or scared, but rather from the annoying  camerawork to give it the faux-documentary look.  On the upswing, the  acting is fine work, and there are some images which are very creepy--ones  that might spawn nightmares. But, it's not enough to make this film work.  Josh Bob says: if you must see it, wait for video, with some Dramamine  beside you. One and half stars.

You never see the ghosts or witches or whatever so you aren't disappointed by that.The only mis-step this film makes as far as I am concerned is the ham-handed way they combine two legends of the town at the same time.  The man who killed seven children and the Blaire Witch.  They seem to be jammed together without showing the connection.Also, the man is supposed to have killed children, two at a time, by making one stand in the corner while he killed the others.  But there are 7 children.I liked how Heather becomes filled with remorse in the iconic scene pictured on the cover.	5.0	This is a classic.  A must have for horror fans	2013-12-11	1	1	0

Heather Donahue's performance alone makes TBWP unmissable.  Come in Jamie Lee Curtis - your time is up!  Is TBWP the scariest movie of  all time?  Well, one can't help feeling that it so easily COULD have been.  In it's drive for realism, TBWP has eliminated one of the essential  ingredients of great horror cinema: a chilling music score.  The  interactive menus on this DVD show just how scary even a little background  music can be.  Despite this, TBWP more than delivers in the spook stakes.  The ending, in particular, will play on your mind for days (and nights).  As a DVD, TBWP is superbly put together, with extras that make you glad you  forked out for that player.  However,  would a widescreen version have been  too much to ask for?  I'm not sure how the movie looks in theatres (it  doesn't open here for another 2 weeks), but the &quot;framed&quot;  fullscreen picture bugged me at times.

It's the unknown, the dread, you can hear the creepiness but can't see it.  Very much liked the characters (okay, at times Heather really got on my nerves) and the concept ... go into the woods to film a witch story, and the witch doesn't like it.  Also enjoyed the filmmaking technique.  Thankfully wobbly camera shots don't bother me!

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3JNVI7XF1LE4A	"Paul ""Writer and listener..."""	I've divided the people who hate this movie into three classes:1. People who saw this movie after the hype had started and were expecting the SCARIEST FILM OF ALL TIME!2. People who think that a film has to have graphic decapitations and disembowelments to be &quot;scary&quot;3. People who pride themselves on disdaining anything that proves to be too popular.The Blair Witch Project is one of the most effective and original films to come out of the independent movement in a long time.  Its fake-documentary format allows the filmmakers to play with the conventions of the horror genre.  It eschews standard shock moments for slowly building an atmosphere of apprehension.  The three actors do a mostly marvellous job of showing their characters coming apart at the seams.  Also, as a former film student, I found their characters immediately recognizable.  Heather's self-important stand-ups at the cemetary and Coffin Rock are dead-on perfect.I've never understood the complaints about the jerky handheld camera work.  These were supposedly student filmmakers hiking in the woods.  What were they supposed to do, bring a steady-cam rig?I loved the ending because it had the guts not to spoonfeed the answers to the audience.  We're told in the &quot;Curse of the Blair Witch&quot; fake-documentary that the footage found was &quot;inconclusive&quot; so naturally the movie can't be clear about the fate of the students.Are there flaws?  Sure, but none are fatal.  I think they knock about a half-star off the rating, which &quot;The Curse of the Blair Witch&quot; adds right back on the score.In many ways, the fake documentary that is included with the DVD is more effective than the movie.  This, more than anything, convinced many people that the Blair Witch Project was true.  If I hadn't known ahead of time that it was fake, I might have bought it too.  &quot;Curse&quot; would not look out of place being shown on the Discovery Channel.The old geezer &quot;historian&quot; is perfectly drawn and convincing as the &quot;colorful local&quot; who buys into the mythology hook, line and sinker.  Also effective is the 70s-era interview with a &quot;real&quot; witch.  It was this touch of including &quot;archival&quot; footage from another era that really gives &quot;Curse&quot; its sense of reality.  Had all the interviews been contemporary, the fakery might have been more apparent.I had some problems with the 40's era &quot;newsreels&quot;.  The interview with &quot;Rustin Parr&quot; was quite effective but the lead-in looked a little too staged.  Then again, newsreels sometimes had that staged feel to them, so this is not a huge problem.  It may have been deliberate.The DVD version also included a audio commentary track from the directors/writers.  This is very entertaining, as they do things like pointing that Josh really was late and then mocking their actors/camera operators for their shot choices.  (I've been on student film shoots and bad shot choices only contribute to the realism).So my advice is: ignore the naysayers and ignore the hype.  Just the see the movie and decide for yourself.	5.0	The future of independent film?	2000-10-27	10	6	4

Beum ""classic film buff"""	I have to go with the other reviewers who have described this as a boring, tedious film where not much of anything really happens. The only scary part was at the very end, and even that leaves you scratching your head wondering what happened. The concept for the movie was original, so you have to give them credit for that. But it just wasn't as frightening as the filmmakers thought it would be or as the hype led me to believe. I found it silly and annoying, particularly the never ending use of the f-word, the s-word, etc. These kids should have been bright enough to come up with better dialogue than that. But the main thing is it just wasn't that scary. If they had shown some kind of menacing figure off in the distance, a shadow, just SOME kind of tangible evidence of some creepy witch or other bogeyman, it would have been much scarier. Little piles of rocks and stick figures just aren't very scary.	2.0	not worth the time investment	2007-04-30	6	3	3
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A34S0FQAI0OYNP	peach momo	Less of a scary horror movie, but more of unrefined documentary footage,  The Blair Witch Project, for all its hype and refreshing video camera  shooting,  fails to keep the viewer entertained at all.There were only  a few so-called &quot;scary&quot; moments in the movie, but they were just  too raw, too vague, to effect real terror in the viewer. Perhaps to savour  these scary scenes, a strong imaginative mind is pretty much a mandatory  requirement here, and I do mean, to an extreme level so much as to  visualise a horrible-looking creature even though it might  not be there?!  Otherwise, the average viewer is likely to be left baffled and unsatisfied  when the scary scenes pass.The use of home video camera shooting was a  refreshing idea, but its novelty was no solid compensation  for the movie's  weak characterisation of the title subject. There were too little visual  vestiges provided in the film as regards to how the witch looked like. Even  a scary-looking shadow would have helped greatly. The &quot;witch&quot;  seemed able to evade the camera all the time.On the whole, the movie was  quite a bland and quiet experience both in the visual and audio aspects.  The only memorable parts of the movie  where things became creepy were  probably that of the explorers discovering twig figures and  the  concluding part. Even for all the promise the concluding part had at the  start, it still dissappointed the viewer ultimately by not letting sight of  the &quot;witch&quot;.VERDICT: One viewing of the movie will be enough,  because it really is only worth that much.	1.0	Boring and unsubstantial - Where is the Witch?	2000-08-06	5	3	2

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1KU405JH6C0PR	"""peter_pan_man"""	This is bad film. It is presented as the discovered documentary footage shot by some film students who mysteriously vanished a few years back searching for a local urban legend called the Blair Witch. Actually, this  movie is just three actors going into the woods, with cameras in tow, in  search of the dreaded Blair Witch. They get lost, lose their map and of  course fail to follow the flow of a nearby stream downward to civilization.  Along the way they over-act fear and anger for most of the movie. A  complete lack of a cohesive screenplay leaves the actors to hurl obsenities  toward each other (anger/day), and to ask each other if they heard  something (fear/night). This pattern rather quickly caused me to begin  rooting for whatever it is that begins terrorizing these losers. I wanted  them dead so that I wouldn't have to hear them scream obsenities at each  for yet another day. This, go- with-the-moment type ad-libbing causes  serious plot and credibility problems. Considering the documentary fashion  the film takes, I found my suspension of disbelief stretched beyond any  realistic expectation many times. For example, these terrified folks  scramble out of their tent, into the darkness, frightened out of their  minds, with their cameras turned on and positioned so as to catch every  second of their panic stricken flight. This film fails to live up to it's  hype on many levels. Knowing this was essentially a student film, I wasn't  expecting top notch, or even mid-range quality visual effects. I was  therefore not surprised to find that the creepy visuals consisted of rocks  stacked on top of each other, sticks and goop wraped up in a mojo type bag,  and stick figures that look like something Martha Stewart knocked out on a  really bad day. Unfortunatly, I was neither frightened nor even mildly  creeped out by these visuals. Sadly, this movie made so much money that we  can, no doubt, aticipate a sequel. Please save your money, do not by this  bad movie!	1.0	A truly bad film that'd make Ed Wood weep with pride.	1999-11-29	0	0	0

(oh, yeah, and i  slept just fine that night except for being annoyed that i had wasted 90  minutes of my life watching this drivel)so the idea of making a  documentary and having the kids go out and use the camcorder was different.  it's not even all that original... has anyone ever heard of clerks?and  just because something is different does NOT make it art. i'd give it 0  stars except i can't.	1.0	proof of how marketing brainwashes americans	1999-12-03	16	10	6

There's no plot here. Just three foul mouthed youngsters being stalked by an unseen witch after getting lost in the Maryland Woods. Their so-called project turns into a hellish nightmare, and they will all meet an uncertain fate soon. Nothing much here, but I like it a little bit.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2OVBT6NHAF6TH	Philip Myers	First off, if you expect The Blair Witch Project to be anything at all like any Hollywood horror film you've ever seen, then do not buy or rent it.  You will be dissappointed.  If you expect high quality production  values, an evocative soundtrack designed to heighten your sense of fear,  smooth camera work and biting dialogue, then this is most certainly NOT the  film for you.  However, if you ignore all the hype and take the film at  face value for what it was intended to be, a &quot;documentary&quot; of an  ill-fated attempt at producing a student film, then you will quite enjoy  the film.  While I cannot see anyone running screaming blue murder from  their living rooms, this film WILL give you an uneasy feeling of dread,  that sense of fear that occupies the darker recesses of the mind.  In  short, it will in all likelihood give you a good dose of the willies.  It's  a good little film that refreshingly doesn't tie up all the loose ends,  giving the viewer an opportunity to use their imaginations while in front  of the television set, a rare exercise to be sure.	4.0	Very Good Film For What It Is	1999-12-23	0	0	0

You need everything spelled out in large-face type?  What is it? I've even heard people b*^@# about the fact  that you don't see anything.  That everything is implied.  THAT'S THE  POINT!

This movie is incomplete, vapid and a display of immature, illogical behavior.These film students are completely green: They know nothing about the woods; they have a limited vocabulary; and they have no sense of direction. They could've compensated for all of these failings by using a little bit of common sense (I've read the other reviews about how these students should've used basic camping skills to find their way out, but what if these students have no camping skills at all. Solution, bring a guide).I can suspend disbelief so long as some semblance of sense is present. After all, all good cinema requires some logic.The people who rave about the movie would say. well, the fear factor overwhelmed these students logic and reasoning. I would retort, they could have avoided this mess, if they would have used logic before they entered the woods anyway.Avoid this movie.	1.0	No sense	2001-01-02	2	2	0

Johnson	"Start by putting me into that category of people who - knowing and loving low-budget horror - cannot fathom the big deal about this entirely artless, witless production. Much has been made of the fact that Blair Witch ""only cost $25000"". WHAT WAS THE MONEY SPENT ON??? Bug spray? Who knows what it takes to trigger the kind of collective hysteria that sometimes allows US movie critics to lower their guard as much as they did to end up championing this glorified home movie (and a bad one at that!). How ironic that critics who normally display such antipathy to the horror genre would end up singing the praises of this film - undoubtedly the worst movie in the horror genre's recent revival (yes - even worse than Jan de Bont's abysmal The Haunting!). Thank heavens critics outside the US saw this film for what it was - a spectacularly anti-climactic non-event. Low budgets are no new thing for horror filmmakers - the best works of the genre are products of innovative filmmakers working with less than stellar budgets. And it is in horror more than any other type of film that filmmakers have proven to be so adept at wringing style, suspense and good storytelling out of the lowest of budgets (cf. Texas Chainsaw Massacre; Night of the Living Dead; Assault on Precinct 13 etc.). In this case, even the least stylish, least original low budget works (e.g. Friday the 13th) look like masterpieces in comparison to the inept ""filmmaking"" on display in Blair Witch. At least in even the worst of the cheapo horrors, directors make SOME effort to provide a decent story, told as best possible. Good luck trying to find any such inclination in this hysterical mess. Better luck trying to find a single scare in this film. Blair Witch makes Dogma 95 filmmaking look like cutting edge special effects cinema. It's nice to believe all of us have the ability or lack of it to make multi-million dollar blockbusters - and Blair Witch proves that we all can. It's nice to think we can all be George Romero or John Carpenter - but Blair Witch proves that we can't. A sad, cynical triumph of hip marketing over entertainment and no-style over no-substance, Blair Witch is the ultimate assault on the necessary value of story, plot and script in moviemaking. Blair Witch benefits from a high curiosity factor, of course. But whichever way you cut it, this so-called movie is little more than the most impressive con ever pulled on the movie going public."	1.0	Overrated, unscary and uninvolving non-movie	2001-02-23	15	10	5

Give offensive kid flashlight and VHS camera (WARNING: higher quality will not work). Old, worn-out cassette tape recommended.3. Inform potty-mouthed child there is no script and he/she must shake camera often - when recording - to reduce video quality.4. Turn VHS camera 'ON'. Set 'GAIN' at highest setting to further reduce video quality. Hit 'RECORD'.5. Release swearing kid with VHS camera in backyard - or nearby park - for 86 minutes. Encourage kid to walk in circles (repetitive scenery a plus) and prattle frequently using the 'F-word'. Make sure kid yammers from time-to-time directly into camera with flashlight shining upwards on face (HINT: flashlight-lit-face 'effect', although clich&eacute;, will appear 'new' and 'exciting' to audience members easily swayed and/or stimulated by feculent language, also clich&eacute;).7. Should something of interest happen during recording, stop tape immediately and erase that portion by recording over it.8. Skip editing. At this stage, as-is, there's a 96.4% chance Blair Witch Project groupies will also rave about your 'creation'.9.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3UYBN36S2ZBLS	"P. Limmer ""MrMellow"""	Well, let's start from the beginning (which is usually the best place to start, but who cares?). This IS NOT the most frightening thing I have ever seen. It's not meant to be. I found it VERY effective as a horror, however. It wasn't truly scary, but it was VERY ominious and quite eerie in it's delieverance. Never have I seen a film made in such a fashion, and it was highly effective. The 'camcorder' style only proved to make the entire experience more effective, and pushing the fear factor further. The acting is superb, and the constant use of adlibs (I'm guessing they're adlibs), was impressive, and only served to further the plot, and make the overall story more moving. Strange symbolism, confused rumour and fictional, but real news reports only serve to (helpfully) confuse the viewer, and the climax in Rustin Parr's house was FANTASTIC. Well worth the 3 it cost to rent it, and WELL worth the 15 it cost to buy. Congrats, Heather, Josh and Michael. Getting lost in the woods payed off after all...shame about the sequel, though.

Unfortunately, it ended up being a waste of five dollars.  I don't see what's so scary about it; all you really see is three kids running around in the woods and getting lost, which is frightening, but only if you're one of them!  Stick figures popping practically out of nowhere is mysterious from the audience's point of view, but doesn't exactly send chills down one's spine, unless, again, you're one of those kids.  There really is nothing scary about the film, with the exception of the fact that it was based on a true story and if there is one area the film succeeded in, it was making you apprehensive about venturing out into the woods of Burkittsville, MD.	2.0	Like watching a stinky piece of cheese.	2003-07-16	5	2	3

The reason I think it's scary because it dosen't have music and nothing looks planned; the tent shaking at night, the house toward the end, the creepy voices of children, and the thought of no escape and being lost that's what's scary to me.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1K6K23WG0IBWE	Quadro Sinead Summer	This film requires little introduction due to the fact that it was a massive hit, so I will bypass all the usual comments some have read too many times to count. I do have to say that you will either love this movie or hate it. Or, like me you may have a love/hate relationship with it. But let's give credit where credit is due. The most amazing thing about this film is that the acting is excellent all the way through. In fact the film is so well acted that few even realize that these people are acting with the use of a script. And though there are many moments that are not scripted, the execution of it all is very convincing. I also have to say it took some real creative thinking to pull it off so well. It really does seem like the entire thing was filmed by three students in the woods making a documentary about the legend of the Blair witch. The main three characters as well as those they interview are all perfect in their performances. It was very well done, and a nifty idea that worked so perfectly. Some already are aware that the film makers borrowed the idea of hand held cameras documenting the event from the classic horror epic 'Cannibal Holocaust'. I think this movie delivers the scares in a big way, and the sense of fear, isolation and misdirection the characters experience is equally shared by the audience. I really liked this movie for it's concept and execution. Worth seeing as long as you realize the confines of the way it was made.	4.0	Way over hyped, but still a pretty good chiller!	2013-05-08	3	2	1

But for me, I think its horrifying, the acting is so realistic, the dialouge is realistic, that sounds funny, but these people don't hold back, they let it all out when they're scared, and the plot is so believable its just nerve wracking to watch this movie in the dark!!!However, this movie is about 3 students who embark on a journey into the Maryland woods where the legend of the Blair Witch is popular. Upon arrival things start out as a normal day, only to increase into a thrilling journey into the heart of horror, madness, and desperation.I would definately reccomend this movie for anyone who is on edge about seeing it, because you might like it, i did, and im glad i watched it, and i now own it on VHS, it was cheaper than buying it on DVD. So, if your like me, watch this movie, i think you'll be surprised with the outcome of it.	5.0	Realistic and Horrifying	2005-04-19	11	6	5
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3QGRSZ7VTV0SY	Rabbi Yonassan Gershom	This movie was a big disappointment to me, but not for the same reasons a  lot of other reviewers have cited.  I can deal with the &quot;home  movie&quot; gimmick, the purposely low-budget look and the amateurish  improv acting -- after all, if this were really unedited video footage shot  by film students (as the story implies), then it probably would look just  like that.  What I found unforgivably stupid was the plot.Much of the  horror (or lack thereof) was based on being lost in the woods and then  getting panicked by every little noise that went bump in the night.  That  might be scarey to city slickers who don't know anything about campcraft,  but I live in the Great North Woods and I'm not afraid of the forest at  night, so the &quot;horror&quot; fell flat.  Sure, there was something out  there that finally got them in the end, but only after they made so many  dumb mistakes that I began to feel they deserved to die out of sheer  stupidity.First of all, it's well-known that if you wander aimlessly  in the woods, you will go in circles, because most people have some degree  of left or right footedness and will take slightly longer strides with one  leg than the other.  Walking in circles is a dangerous waste of energy.  So  what you do upon getting lost in the woods is to STAY PUT, conserve your  strength, and build a nice big smokey signal fire -- that will bring the  firefighters to you in a hurry.  What these three idiots did was throw away  the map (mistake #2, and a really lame plot device), then walk themselves  to exhaustion, crossing the same creek and fallen log over and over again.  And that was mistake #3 because, as any Boy or Girl Scout knows, if you  follow water downhill, you have a pretty good chance of eventually finding  some sign of civilization, because people tend to settle along creeks at  the bottom of mountains.  Of course, if they had followed the stream back  into town, the movie would have ended halfway through -- which, in my  opinion, would be no great loss.	2.0	Scarey to city  slickers ( well, maybe)	2000-09-04	10	5	5
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3ZP2A2SWNRCB	race_of_doom	At first showing, I'll admit I was kind of  disappointed, being dragged through all the hype. But after a second viewing, I realized that &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; is really something of a different nature...  here's a few tips to truly enjoy the film: 1) Watch. Just stay tuned. 2)  Don't listen to anyone around. Don't even respond. It ruins buildup; I'll  say what that is later. 3) Blast the speakers. 4) Dim the lights. No, turn  them off. Now, after a viewing, how do you feel? Utterly scared to death?  Still have an impression of some rocks laying on the ground in your head?  Scared of what's lurking the shadows? Hmmm? I know how you feel. This  independent film explores all nerve endings, in one, short, 90 minute film.  As watching, I felt scared, well, (I'm ashamed to admit)for myself... but  really, scared for those poor, poor kids. Even after the movie was over, I  still felt completely absorbed to the film. I just couldn't get my thoughts  off of it. And alas, it was a GREAT ending. Words don't express what I feel  for this film. It was made for a roughly $40,000.... and that, my friends,  is what makes it so eerie. If the film was made with a nice, sliding  camera, you know, the kind you see in the multi-blockbuster movies, then  this wouldn't have been a scary movie. It sounds weird, but the shaky  camera REALLY works. It just has that feeling of reality. If this were  real, this would HAVE to be rated about 100 stars. But for now, this movie  should leave an impression on all viewers, old to young. Rent before you  buy... and watch, a few times.	5.0	I don't care what anyone else says; this is a classic	1999-12-17	2	0	2
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A202F9TC1WXZJ4	Rachel Z	This has to be the greatest horror movie ever made. What makes it so great was that the fear was in these young peoples minds. If we actually saw a witch, everyone would think that it was so trite and obvious. Of course we would not normally be scared of sticks or piles of rocks. It was the way the rocks were formed outside their tent that made them afraid. This movie is all about the fear of the unknown.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2B8G7W3JXKMZA	"Randolph Bradley ""RBJ"""	"This film is a study (clinical?) in provoking terror.  It succeeds admirably.  It never pretended at any point, pre- or post-release to be anything but about those three filmmakers lost in the woods and a witch.  Since it's about witchcraft (the supernatural), how much is supposed to be real or believable anyway? I give it 5 stars based on it's original approach to horror filmmaking and it's &quot;seemingly&quot; accurate interpretation of what may have happened to the real student filmmakers lost in the woods.  In general, you must suspend disbelief (put it in your pocket or under the couch momentarily) to enjoy any movie.  Try to see what the filmmakers are showing you with the least amount of bias.  Think about it: film, photographs, CDs, DVDs, etc. are all facsimiles of something extinct or extant.  Some can ask legitimately,  ""What is real?""  This is quite evident by the ideas positioned by the Wachowski brothers (The Matrix), and their statement, ""There is no spoon.""  They broke filmmaking ground at the other extreme.  BIG BUDGET.  Consequently, both companies make us think.  I have to be intellectually stimulated to really enjoy something-you know, to analyze it.  Therefore, even those who hate this film are enriched by its clinical study in terror provocation.  The concept of clinical study is to isolate a variable into a fixed setting and test specific reaction.  This movie functions from this perspective.  We all participated in the marketing hype.  However, the hype was generated more from the public's and media's reactions than from the true stories of the Blair Witch or this low-budget theatrical account.  In conclusion, either this film will scare you (subliminally) or it will not-based on its fundamental academic/clinical intrinsic value."	5.0	Particularly  Academic	2001-03-11	5	2	3

However, it is not a slasher movie -- it requires putting yourself in the shoes of the person (i.e., imagination).  Unfortunately, most viewers do not have that anymore.The quality of the film is quite good for an &quot;amateur&quot; film.  The transfer to DVD is excellent.The sound effects are actually quite  realistic.  Despite the means to achieve them, it sounds like Maryland  hikes.  I have hiked a lot of woods and some Maryland woods actually sound  different, especially in the fall/winter, from many other woods.  Don't  believe me?  Try it.  When you have hiked in 15 different states, then see  if your opinion changes.The scenery is realistic -- just what you see on  hikes.  It's not the glamorous shots many expect to see.  However, I have  yet to see any camera / format that can do any woods or mountains justice.

The students disappeared without a trace. A year later, their home video was found &amp; it chronicles their ordeals before they disappeared.The film was a very creepy horror film, yet the horror is not shown. The three students are subjected to a nightmarish ordeal in the woods, yet the viewer can't see it. Therein lies the effectiveness of the film: the horror is suggested, not shown. What the viewer THINKS is happening to the poor students is more frightening that what is actually shown on film. The power of SUGGESTION is very potent indeed &amp; this film shows what suggestion &amp; perception can make for some effective horror films.The film grossed over $130 million from a budget of around $40, 000. It is one of the most successful independent films of all time. This movie may disappoint the casual horror film fan who is used to blood &amp; gore in a typical horror film. Yet, one must view this film with an open mind. Some of the best horror films DO NOT have to rely on blood &amp; gory special effects to be scary.

It was so fun.  Scared the hell out of them.  I loved the concept of this movie and the marketing done on it when it came out.  A real documentary filmed by three zealous high schoolers just trying to earn a grade.  A very creepy finale that leaves much to the imagination.

At first it was kinda boring, and I thought that it was gonna end up being a waste of time, but as the movie  progressed and &quot;weird&quot; things started to happen and the kids  started freaking out, it got pretty freaky.  The only things that I have to  complain about is the constant use of the &quot;f&quot; word (that word can  get pretty damn annoying when it's said in every sentence) and the girl.  She really bothered me.  The whole bouncing of the camera didn't bother me  at all.  I thought it made the movie seem more real.

The premise was fresh, it was  executed in a novel manner, and this movie will still be scary 20 years  from now, as the horror comes from what the viewer makes of the film,  whereas an effects laden film will simply appear ridiculous when technology  marches on.  Definitly not for everyone, but for a thinking individual who  loves to theorise...well, this is the film for you.	5.0	Not For The Desensitized	1999-09-14	0	0	0

This film did scare me when I was 11, so I decided to watch it again for memories sake. Its still an effective and original horror movie, But I couldnt help my self from laughing throughout the film. While there was plenty that went wrong with TBWP its still a must see horror film.The film was made for  $40,000 and grossed over $130 million making it the most lucrative independent film in history.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A11FDFNAR7OMZB	"""redgrevillea"""	There's a lot more to this film than just fickle spooky stuff.  For those who love hiking/tramping/bushwalking etc it's a fascinating insight into how emotions flair when things aren't going quite right.  Being lost in the  bush/woods/forest or being inadvertedly caught out there in the dark  without adequate gear is an experience in itself.  I loved the backdrop, I  thought...&quot;..Maryland woodlands, nice...&quot;.  I enjoyed the  characterisation, they were actors surely but all they had to do was  improvise a scenario and get on with just being themselves more or less in  a do-it-yourself environment (credit to the directors), it was fascinating  to observe how these 20-somethings lost the plot over a period of 7 days.  I liked the intrinsic realness to it all, the total lack of 'industry', the  graininess, I felt for the characters, they could have been any young  attuned college student or graduate.  If anything, the ornamental spooky  stuff with sticks'n'stones was a little laughable in retrospect but that  horrid final scene with that house and its shockingly evil vibe was  captured well.  I felt close to this film because I myself love getting out  there.  Yes all the witchcraft stuff was (and still is) purely fictional  but some places out in the woods do have a 'vibe' to them...apparently  close to here, Catalina Park in Katoomba in the highlands west of Sydney is  one such place.....in all, vitally Earthy, grainy, emotionally real,...it's  a fictional attempt to describe what may occur when a small group of people  become detached from the world's familiar crutches and are put up against  the natural Earth and its massed psychic energy without the protection of  worldly props...it was cleverly done.  It lingered.	5.0	Hiking Extravaganza	1999-12-17	1	1	0

I don't get the reason people got scared. I am scared  more by practical things like people breaking into your house of stuff like  that..but anyway, I thought the movie was funny. The way they ran around  and ran away from rocks and bickered was absolutely hilarious. I was  busting out laughing!! And Heather needs to take a lesson in shutting up. I  mean, F--- this and F--- that and F--- you and RUN F---ING RUN YOU FILTHLY  BAS----!! The F-word got old after a while, I mean, that is one of the  parts I found non-believable.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2XP14MS2EDLV0	Reginald Thornburton	"I remember the massive hype that came along with this film's release.  I sat through it at a movie theater and can honestly say it's the first time I seriously considered asking for my money back.  I've seen some bad films, and in particular some truly awful horror films (Howling 7, House of the Dead, etc), but this turd takes the cake.First, the ""palpitating terror"" is limited to shaky camera work and overacting in a failed attempt to convey some sense of documentary reality.  Second, there is no witch or anything else that anyone would classify as ""scary"" shown, but unlike in the Hitchcock films that were so adept at creating a sense of dread out of nothing, this film (and I use that term loosely) can only succeed at creating an overwhelming sense of annoyance.But the coup de gras of this shining example of hype without substance is the fact that these morons wondering around in the woods are supposedly lost, yet cross fairly sizable creeks and streams three to four times.  Even kids who ride the short bus know that water doesn't run in a circle. It starts somewhere and ends somewhere, but why follow a stream when you can wander around aimlessly like a tool?  Frankly, it's too bad this movie wasn't real, because if it were I'd Fedex the absent witch a bottle of wine with an etched label saying, ""Thanks for supporting natural selection!"".Don't waste your money."	1.0	Utter Crap	2011-10-30	10	0	10

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A39W3263A9HCMN	"Renfield ""Up the Irons"""	"Often Hitchock would say that when the terrorizing force showed itself, the film wasn't scary. People found this ridiculous and asked him ""What IS scary, then?"". His response- ""When you don't see anything. It's up to the imagination."" And he couldn't be more correct- that sentiment is what contributed to the scare factor of the slow budget indie thriller The Blair Witch Project. Since then, almost NO movies have followed that rule at all. Blair Witch doesn't rely on scenes that make you jump right out of your seat at all- it relies on the fear of being alone and the creepy suspense/tension.Of course, the only movie I can think of that followed this rule is the notoriousParanormal Activity, and either you loved that movie or hated it. Blair Witch is no different- people were either bored/nauseous from the camera work/laughing, or were on the edge of their seats. I fall in the latter camp, as I'd take creepy tension over gimmicky gore and blood/""BOO!!!!"" scenes. This movie has neither of those, and should you expect this content, you will be disappointed big time.The Blair Witch Project tells the story of Josh, Heather and Michael, the three students who had heard of the blair witch urban legend. They are filming a documentary and decide to interview a few people before going out into the woods to find out more about the Blair Witch. The Blair WItch was a notorious unknown force who is said to have lived in those woods. However, things are bad from the start- camera problems and getting lost in the middle of nowhere is a killer. Then, it gets worse- they soon find out it's not just them in the woods, the Blair Witch is there too...Like I said, a large part of this movie is your imagination. That's right, nothing spoonfed to you. If you want to be told everything, go see something else. Blair Witch does a mighty fine job at letting your mind decide what's scary. This movie is a masterpiece for that reason. As well as the acting is just plain real- it's all improvised, and these actors do a bloody good job at it. And that ending- *shudder*.Overall, if you can take a film that relies on TENSION and not gimmicks to be scary, you will enjoy this. Otherwise, get a gimmicky PG-13 horror flick with gimmicks and jump scares."	5.0	Prepare to use your imagination	2011-01-20	5	4	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3W13VVBRY5GL7	"Review Lover ""ReviewLover"""	If you happen to be one of the poor fools who, even for a second, believed the hype of the Blair Witch project around the time of its Cinematic release, then do yourself a favour and get lost in the woods.The 'movie' is basically shot, almost unwatchably, on Super-8, and asks us to consider the three hapless, witless protagonists as they run about in a forest screaming at anything that moves. Nothing happens until the final three minutes, and by then, you care so little for the 'gang' that you long to see them dispatched in a gruesome fashion.  Little men made of twigs and blurry hankerchiefs with red stains on them pass as supposedly scary imagery, and the standard of acting could be considered illegal most everywhere in the world.Sadly, I can award a one-star minimum to this ridiculous piece of dribble (I would very much like to give it no stars at all, and set it on fire, just to make sure nobody will ever see it again), and I strongly urge anybody on the market for a scary movie to buy something else, ANYTHING else, before The Blair Witch Project. Mommie Dearest has better actors and The Sound Of Music is scarier. It's not clever, it's not edgy, and it most certainly is not fit for human consumption.

A basic requirement for truly appreciating horror movies is no other than imagination.  If you constantly cling to special effects, if a  horror means blood and thunder for you, if you are too lazy to use your  head and hold such a seeing-is-believing formula towards a horror film, and  if your IQ (by which I mean Imagination Quotient) is nearly zero, then this  work of art is not for you so spare your unwisely swearing.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1AMMXQRWC9QOG	Richard Brooke	I firmly believe that in years to come, when the film history books are rewritten, &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; will go down as one of the greatest jokes ever played on cinema audiences. Like many, many others, I  was taken in by the hype that surrounded this film and was prepared to be  scared out of my skin. I was not. The acting was appalling (OK, so I  concede that this may have been &quot;the point&quot;), the camera work  truly nausea-inducing, and, let's be honest, would these young students  really NOT have taken a mobile 'phone with them? (Yes, I do understand the  concept of suspending your disbelief, but it is a good film that makes you  do this.)The biggest problem with this film is that you really do not  give a hoot about the fact that someone is out to get the main characters.  Compare this with &quot;Psycho&quot;: although Marion Crane has committed  two &quot;crimes&quot; (that we know of)- adultery and theft- we still care  about her and are thus devastated when she dies. With the main characters  in &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, they could not have been killed off  quickly enough for my liking. (Interestingly enough, when I saw this film  at the cinema, people were walking out after about 30 minutes: the film  only ran for 80!)For genuine psychological terror, use your cash to buy  the original version of &quot;The Haunting&quot; or Polanski's  &quot;Repulsion&quot;, Spielberg's &quot;Duel&quot; or, for a different  type of psychological torture, witness the dreadful and destructive games  that Burton and Taylor play out in &quot;Who's Afraid of Virginia  Woolf&quot;. Like the victims of The Blair Witch who are forced to stand in  the corner and not look at the Witch, &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;  would stand in the corner and hide its face in shame when compared with  such masterly studies in psychological terror.	1.0	Hmm...	2000-05-10	18	12	6

Yes, it will rescue you from hormone hell, otherwise known as puberty, aka middle school kids. How can I be so sure this movie will do the dirty deed? Read my TOP TEN reasons (even if you are NOT a Mr. or Mrs. One-of-the-Thousand-Points-of-Light):1. The only thing scary about this film is the way the three project team members treat each other. Can you say obnoxious to the core? I knew you could.2. Roughly every third word is the f-word, enough to put make a South Park punk blush or a sailor jealous. If the expletives are deleted, you're left with gibberish, which might sound like a witch after all.3. Leaves. Lots of leaves. This film was shot in the Maryland woods in late autumn. Imagine yourself on a National Geographic special, only the film crew is drunk, very drunk. Half of this film is shot looking at the ground.4. Heather, the team leader, should have her mouth duck-taped. Unfortunately, the guys were too stupid to bring any.5. Generation X in all its g(l)ory. Uh, duh, how do I use a compass and how can I find my way out of the woods? They bring a survival book but apparently can't read it. Shows you what happens when a generation is raised indoors with electronics. This group couldn't find their way out of a cereal box.6. Suspense is a tad bit lacking. I did, however, catch my breath once--but only to see if I was still breathing. The plot moves more slowly than Senator Strom Thurmond speaks, or about the same as your pet turtle swimming in a jar of molasses. The last ten minutes are better but I think the film crew was just eager to get things wrapped up to get out of the rain.7. Camera angles. In addition to the leaves--lots of leaves--the tent shots are all from the vantage point of a beetle. Two guys and a girl sleeping together...hmmm...you think they could have been a little more imaginative than &quot;what's that?&quot; &quot;did you hear that?&quot;8. Bogeyman. Well, if the official reviewers can say it, I can say it, right? WE NEVER SEE IT/HIM?HER. Oh, I know, we should let our imagination run wild. But by the time you realize you won't see IT (which is actually the film producers running around like fools), you don't give a flip anymore. Your imagination is asleep.9. Low Budget. Yeah, I know big budget doesn't always work (e.g. Waterworld) but, heh, $40,000. I mean, they had to give credit to a juice company for pete's sake. The producers should be required to reinvest this money in...yes, the Girl and Boy Scouts of America! Now that would be fittingly ironic.10. Cost. I paid ten kwai, or about $1.25 for my nefarious copy. I was ripped off. This film is 77 minutes long, much less if you don't read credits. I think that violates some unwritten rule or something. I mean, come on, 67 minutes? Gotta run. I have firecrackers to light--now that's more suspensful.	1.0	Project Grade: F (see me after class)	2001-01-26	19	13	6
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A93Q94IOGXF6P	"Rick ""hunternc"""	I didn't go to the theater to see this and I didn't rent it from Wallet-Buster's, but I finally taped it off pay-per-view, just last week- more out of curiosity over the hoopla than anything else. So, as you can  tell, I was a little bit negative going into my first viewing of this  wildly popular movie. The first thing that occurred to me about this movie  once the characters got into the woods was that ANYONE WITH A CAMCORDER  COULD HAVE MADE THE SAME PICTURE! Here's what I got out of it: three  college kids get lost deep in the woods while shooting a documentary on the  legend of the Blair Witch. Along the way, they lose their map, they hear  strange noises at night, they get nervous and short with each other and say  the 'f' word a LOT, way too much, in fact. I think the reason this movie  became so popular was due to the fact that we've all feared getting lost in  the woods and this movie is all about that with the added paranoia of the  fable of a centuries-old witch out in the woods somewhere. The Sci-Fi  Channel's special &quot;Curse of the Blair Witch&quot; probably played a  large part with a lot of viewers decision to go see this, as it set up the  legend as being a true story- which it was not. I think the producer's had  a great idea here, but I also think they could have done more with it. Two  things we know for sure: they made a fortune off of this flick and there  will be imitations forthcoming. Hopefully, someone can do it better.	2.0	Over-hyped, over-rated	1999-12-19	0	0	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2UUFNBHOFL4MK	Rick Jones	I found this movie very interesting.  I first watched it on a 5&quot; TV on an aircraft.  The screen had lousy contrast and I had trouble seeing most of the dark scenes.  I watched the ending three times - and still  didn't get it.  I left the flight wondering what all the fuss was about.  Yet, the movie still haunted me.  What did I miss?  I had to know!  So, I  bought the DVD and watched it twice at home.  The movie isn't the kind of  horror that you'd get from Steven King.  It's not the Freddy Krueger type  either.  It's worse.  It is haunting because you simply don't know, all the  way through the movie, what it is that is following and taunting the three  hapless moviemakers.  The acting - well, I'd like to be generous - was an  interesting concept.  Put three people in the woods, with a bit of a plot,  scare the hell out of them for eight days and see what happens.  The result  could have been better, but was nonetheless still an excellent horror film.  I finally managed to get the ending, and it is quite obvious on the second  watching of the movie.  Since I didn't know any of the pre-release hype  about the film, I watched the included documentary, trying to work out if  it was real - I know: &quot;I KNEW that it wasn't real, but it SEEMED so  real - AND IT RAISED DOUBTS&quot;.  The doco and news footage included on  the DVD made the whole exercise so much more enjoyable.  The movie isn't  for everyone, but you really ought to give it a try.  For a $40,000 budget,  the result is nothing short of amazing.  With over $100m returned in the  box office, it is without doubt a success.	4.0	An interesting idea that worked - but not for everyone	2000-05-11	2	1	1

I was a very willing participant and was looking forward to some chills and  terror, but unfortunately the film failed to deliver.  I believe the  filmmakers let the viewers off the hook too easily - there is tension and  terror in the night, yet these scenes seemed too short.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2G8WDSP8UWSG5	Ripley Clone 8	"I have enjoyed these films where a random group of civilians takes there cameras and films events that would rarely happen. Cloverfield, Quarantine, and the film I just finished ""The Blair Witch Project"" are all very scary, suspenseful, on the edge of your seat, and overall beyond scary as hell movies. Of course I could say these three movies are better in certain ways then others but I would specifically like to talk about The Blair Witch Project. First off this movie just gives you the creeps and I mean the REAL creeps. The Blair Witch Project is shot like your watching a homemade video off of a crappy video camera which makes it twice as scary as it is. There's no soundtrack (music) to the film and it looks just completely homemade. Its hard to make a movie scary when the quality of the movie is bad but if you can produce something that's that scary like that I think it deserves a 5 star.You have Heather, Josh, and Mike who document people telling stories and myths of the Blair Witch. Then they literally drive off in the middle of the woods supposedly where they think the Blair Witch exists. Heather and Mike have two separate cameras to document. The group thinks that they will just tour around the woods for the weekend, maybe film a few things here and there and then head home by Sunday to be back at work by Monday. Well...the weekend ends up longer then just 2 days and things start unraveling pretty bad and I mean SCARY BAD.I was watching this by myself at 12:00 a.m. with a lighting storm, in the dark, and in my room. After this experience I think I don't want to watch this ever again by myself. I just might have to show my friends this movie since they never seen it.Overall, The Blair Witch Project is a SCARY AS HELL MOVIE with creeps and shills running up your arms and spine, especially when your watching it BY YOURSELF IN THE DARK. Watching this movie any time of the day and with friends doesn't really at all remove your reaction after the film grows dark. Lets just say I won't be leaving my room by myself for at least a couple of days. Anyone will enjoy The Blair Witch Project if you like these types of movies or horror movies in general."	5.0	Blair Witch Project Sure Produces That Scare That Will Last!	2009-06-11	2	2	0

After this film, I went home, locked all my doors and windows, then went and double-checked them. I went to bed. Then I got up and triple-checked my doors and windows. And I did this for several nights following.I do not scare easily. I can eat dinner while watching a slasher film; I can read Stephen King novels, and books about Jack the Ripper right before bedtime, yet still sleep peacefully.But this movie had me. Not only was I on the edge of my seat the whole time, but the ending froze me. The ending is one of the best I've ever seen, and the most frightening part of this very scary film.This film scares by suggestion, and has virtually no gore. The directors realize that no special effect is more powerful than the audience's imaginations, so they deliberately probe our minds, spurring the most horrible imaginings.If you want the pants scared off of you, this is the film you want.	5.0	Lock Your Doors	2003-10-21	8	5	3

TLB came out one year BEFORE Blair Witch, and is far superior...the BWP film makers even admit to having seen TLB before making their movie--this confirms somewhat my conspiracy theory that Artisan threw some money at some ""amateur film makers"" to [outright steal the story line of TLB and] make a ""real"" horror documentary--instead of the story we all know too well. Someone turned me on to TLB sometime after I wasted an hour in the Blair Witch queue and  fell asleep near the end of the film (with my girlfriend, no less--bloody boring movie!), and was elated/enraged after seeing TLB--after finding out about the back story of how BWP came about, and having wished I'd seen TLB first.

BUT- I watched this on Halloween in hope of getting a good Halloween scare. After seeing the reviews, I thought the people saying it wasnt scary were just trying to be cool, so I gave it a go. I was dissapointed. This movie is only scary if you put yourself in their positons, otherwise it's a dud. However entertaining it may be, it was made to be horror, and in that it did not succeed.

I think this movie was made so the viewers can think to themselves, 'what if that was me?' Imagine yourself in a forest that you can't escape from, and especially if you keep getting encounters with ghosts.I gave this movie two stars because I thought it was boring, but there were a couple of freaky scenes, which were good.This film will probably be remembered as a film that a lot of people like and dislike.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1KQGM021YCMQ	Robert Douglas	It's difficult writing a review without revealing some of the plot details. Therefore, before you read any further, ensure you have seen this film - otherwise STOP HERE! Now then, we're dealing with a release with similar traits comparable to other horror movies. But there's one remarkable difference: it was filmed using home video cameras held by the cast (students on a college project), and the audience is actually seeing through these lenses. This seemed to make it more thrilling than a film that's requires camera precision, and it was an original idea. It really felt like I was one of the group. Very few films have this quality of involving the audience at a closer level. Unlike the Hammer horror films, and other recent ones like Bram Stoker's Dracula, there's surprisingly little blood and gore - well, except for one scene when she opened a clutch of twigs. But this isn't an essential requirement: the storyline itself managed very well on its own. It's gripping, intense, and full of suspense. I found myself wondering what the heck was making those strange tapping noises, and thought, 'don't go out there'! But, against better judgement, perhaps inevitably, they did. I also felt a certain sense of anquish at their plight, all the while hoping they'd come across a road or some homestead - yet deep down I knew it wasn't to be. First they lost the map, then they lost their wits, what was left of their humour had soon dried up, they fought amongst themselves. Perhaps one message in this film can be summed up in three words: faith, determination, teamwork. If you keep your head and concentrate, then you might avoid a slow, tortuous death. Towards the end, what became of Josh? Where did he disappear to? Was he killed by rednecks, savages untouched by civilzation - or had the Blair Witch legend come to life and sought sacrifice? What truly happened? The end was shrouded in mysterious tragedy. A sudden blow to the head, and it was all over. There is one final theory: did Josh take their discovery of the wicker men one step further and went psychopathic? If you remember, he MIGHT have been the one calling to them in that ramshackle house. If so, was he a victim, or a murderer? With so much speculation, this film proves to be one of the best in horror fiction. I won't be camping out in the woods - ever again!	4.0	One of the best horror films I've ever seen	2000-10-30	1	1	0

I think it's neat to watch despite what anyone else says. Here's the gig with the movie: 3 filmmakers decide to make a documentary, so they start to ask people around town if they've ever heard of the Blair Witch. Most people say they have, and others indeed say they had an encounter. So, then they decide to go into the woods and check it out....BIG MISTAKE. While they're there, one of them loses the map in the creek and the other two get mad at him for it. During the night scenes, they hear sounds in the woods like footsteps and other creepy noises. Before that, they recall what somebody said about a pile of rocks and that is exactly what they find outside of the tent the next morning...but it wasn't there the night before. That's when they end up staying a lot longer than expected. Soon after that, one of them vanishes and they also find sticks made in the figures of dolls and individual sticks all into one bundle. That's when there's a huge mixup because a whole bunch of other creepy things happen on their stay. Oh, yeah, and the sticks were all covered in blood, too. This is why filming a documentary when all of these things happen is a pretty bad idea.	4.0	I got it for $2.99	2005-02-06	5	1	4

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1MWZCZGTE79DT	Rod Labbe	"Oh, God, where do I begin? Like so many lemmings, I was suckered into seeing this terrible excuse for a horror film back in August of 1999. I'd watched the Sci-Fi Channel special (which is much, much better than the film--and it was FREE), read all the glowing Internet chat-room reviews, and saw the effective TV ads. So, I plunked down my cash, had a seat, and prepared myself to get scared. And I prepared myself. And prepared myself. And then, the lights came on, and the movie was over.How did I feel at that moment? The word is EXPLOITED. I'd just been gypped out of $...not to mention gas and snacks. Plus, I wasted my time!THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT has a great premise, no doubt about it--but the movie itself is an inane, low-budget mess. It goes on forever and ever and just limps to a conclusion that makes absolutely NO sense whatsoever. Ok, what was wrong with it? Well, first, we're led to believe that three filmmakers have been ""lost"" while exploring the legend of the Blair Witch, a legendary folktale that just might have its basis in reality. The filmmakers disappear under mysterious circumstances, but all the footage they shot has been found...thus THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT! Ah, but what is this footage? Try two hours of the ""F"" word (hence the ""R"" rating), a totally annoying ""performance"" by Heather Donahue (I wanted to slap her so badly!), and non-stop filming. I mean, non-stop--even when they're arguing and having hissy fits with each other, they never seem to forget to film it. At the end, they're running across a forest, full of ruts and roots, still filming--and they never once look down at their feet. Then, they run into a totally strange house, up and down stairs, and never once look at their feet. I don't know about you, but if my sight was being compromised by a camera stuck to my face, I just might be a bit cautious running up and down stairs in an abandoned house! Especially when the stairs are covered in junk!I honestly think there was a concerted effort by Artisan Films to swamp the Internet with ""plants"" who claimed to ""love"" this film. In that, Blair Witch is most definitely innovative! They used the world wide web to make their film a hit, laughing all the way to the bank!Avoid this DVD! Avoid this video! Avoid this movie!

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3AD071UEP20WS	"Roger Long ""longrush"""	While this movie has an R rating and supposedly is not to be seen by anyone under 18, it was made for the 14-16 year old.  The only reason it  would have an R rating is language, and that did become offensive after  about the 200th repetition of &quot;F---.&quot; The movie is flawed from  first to last, but the worst fault is the fact that there is not one  sympathetic figure among the participants, and one starts hoping the witch  will get them quickly and painfully, starting with the foul-mouthed,  egotistical girl.  When there is no one to care about, it becomes nigh  impossible to care about the movie itself.  Now, perhaps the 15-year old  will be much taken with how wonderful this all is (and how &quot;just  f---ing uncool,&quot; I am, to borrow a much repeated term from the film),  but any mature person should find this a  colossal bore. By the way, if you  lose your map, follow a stream downhill.  Anyone knows that, anyone who has  ever gone for a tramp in the woods, secondary growth at that, in this case.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3TOQAMJURAYFC	Roland Dark	"Student filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S&aacute;nchez have delivered a quaint, spooky little tale with a budget tantamount to the price of catering a single meal for the cast of a standard Hollywood film.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" follows the misadventures of a trio of film students (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael C. Williams), who armed with two video cameras, set out to make a documentary based on an eerie Burkittsville, Maryland folk legend.  Not far into an excursion through a secluded woods, their playful enthusiasm gives way to tension and terror, as they find themselves lost, someone - or some thing - stalking them every step of the way.Relying on a paper-thin plot barely sustained by realistic emotion and situations, ""The Blair Witch Project"" generates its effectiveness by exploiting what most big budget films consider taboo - raw, shaky camera work, unheard-of actors, believable premise, and zero usage of special effects.  The environment selected for the shoot, virgin of set decorators and flashy lighting techniques, captures the essence of an ominous forest perfectly - I kind of like it because it bears a startling resemblance to my favorite place to hike!  The acting, which demonstrates the mental breakdown of the characters, is quite convincing, especially Heather Donahue (recently seen in Steven Spielberg's Sci-Fi Channel miniseries ""Taken"").  While the incessant arguing of the three tends to become a trifle vexing, it actually imbues the film with a higher degree of realism.  If you were lost in a cold, damp forest for days, hungry and thirsty, being followed by a psychotic killer or other entity with the intent to harm, would you be leisurely skipping, beaming a robust smile?  Still does not explain why they never took a cellular telephone...""The Blair Witch Project"" is not really scary - spooky, but not scary.  Over hyped and hardly a ""Citizen Kane"", but still worth a peek for its unique approach.  A fun film for amateur filmmakers to watch."	3.0	Interesting Film Student Experiment	2003-01-26	2	1	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	&quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; succeeds where so many horror films fail because of the sheer simplicity of its conception and design, allowing  it to tap far more deeply into a wide range of primal fears than the  conventional &quot;fright&quot; films churned out regularly by major  Hollywood studios. While the latter films tend to dilute their terror  through overplotting, over production and over reliance on special effects,  &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; eschews all that for creativity, visual  inventiveness and an admirable conviction that what is left unseen is often  more terrifying than what is visualized.The film presents itself  cleverly as a pseudodocumentary tale of a group of fictional college  students who become lost in the woods while endeavoring to film a study of  a local scary legend. With this structure, the film creepily conjures up  many of the basic anxieties and dreads humans are prone to such as fear of  the dark, of being hopelessly lost in an isolated environment, of  unidentifiable noises on which one can project one's greatest terrors, of  total loss of control against an unknown and malevolent force.Even more  impressive is the way the film expands to become a study of the human  psyche when it is placed into a situation of unspeakable fear and  desperation. As the characters begin to grasp the gravity of their  situation, the forced jocularity begins to be stripped away revealing the  childlike terror, guilt, need for recrimination and eventually despair and  hopelessness that overtake them. The actors are brilliant in capturing the  full gamut of emotions these characters must go through before the  preordained tragic end. The film also provides a slyly satirical spin on  the obsessively cinematic tone of modern life, wherein every event must be  captured on film or videotape, so much so that, even as death is breathing  down the necks of these characters, the cameras continue to roll to record  it. As one of them says in justification, &quot;That's all I have  left.&quot; That is her piece of the comfortable world of familiarity that  helps her, at least momentarily (if futiley), evade the harsh reality of  her situation. Also, these characters pay a high price for the superior  tone of cavalier indifference and almost mockery they display towards the  tales of the legend they have come to &quot;investigate.&quot;More than  any horror film of recent memory, &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; gets  under the viewer's skin and gives one that feeling of creepy vulnerability  that only the best horror films can do.	5.0	creepy, original horror film	2000-07-23	8	4	4

I am neither one so with that said let me begain.The set up:In October 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary... A year later their footage was found.The footage is edited into the movie:The Blair Witch Project follows a trio of filmmakers on what should have been a simple walk in the woods... but quickly becomes an excursion into heart-stopping terror. As the three become inexplicably lost, morale deteriorates. Hunger sets in. Accusations fly. By night, unseen evil stirs beyond their campfire's light. By day, chilling ritualistic figures are discovered nearby. As the end of their journey approaches, they realize that what they are filming now is not a legend...but their own descent into unimaginable horror.Now, this movie did give me some chills but the overall fear facter when watching this movie is close to none.  The end and some of the sound FX will give you the willies but nothing more.  No big jumps.  Hardly any blood.  This movie goes back to the roots with sound, isolation, and darkness becomes scary, and it works.  When this movie is over turn off all the lights or go outside in the dark, you will be freaked out.So I figure in the end this movie works, it does what its sopossed to do.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AYIHIIOO7Z6P0	Ruth Henriquez Lyon	One of the most enduring Western folk tale motifs has to do with woods/wildernesses and witches.  Thumb through a copy of Grimm's Brothers folk tales, or watch the film The Wizard of Oz. In these stories, the witch  personifies the chthonic forces of Nature, which can be confronted and  transformed into usable energy for the hero(ine) and society.  Usually the  protagonist accomplishes this transformation by meeting helpers on the way,  but finding the helpers requires an open heart, an aware mind, and the  necessary respect and reverence for the larger powers inhabiting the  wild.......In this story the protagonists are self-absorbed, irreverent,  and extremely undisciplined physically, emotionally, and morally.  They  enter the woods as if it is just another playground.  Such do not fare well  on the journey through the Underworld.  The so-called project is quite  self-referential--it's more about the lead woman in her search for the  witch than it is about the witch herself......These people are so blind  that they cannot use what helps are available to lead them to safety, that  is, the river and the sun.  The trap they fall into is really the trap of  their own overblown egos, which the woods turns against them......This  could well be the story of the modern day Everyman, who sees Nature as a  stage for his own self-serving production, rather than as the intermediary  source of our Being.....	5.0	an ancient story with a modern, cautionary twist	1999-12-31	2	2	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1E96RY9N8MMF	"Ryan ""Ryan"""	"When young college film students Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams decide to make a film about the Blair witch legacy in Burkittsville (formally known as ""Blair"") they must enter the woods where the witch onced lived some 100 years ago. During the night sounds are heared. Disturbing sounds, such as children crying and screaming and in the morning the trio finds mysterious rock formations and stick figures lying around. The longer they stay there, the more evil surrounds them. Though, you never see what is attacking them the movie leaves it up to you to decide what this ghostly force is. One of them disappears and bloody teeth are found. Filmed in b&w; with some color footage this film will have you shivering until the very end...I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO SAY THAT THE REASON WHY MANY PEOPLE GAVE THIS FILM ONLY ONE STAR IS BECAUSE AFTER SEEING ""SCREAM"" OR ""NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET"" THEY FEEL THAT THIS FILM HAS VERY LITTLE GORE (WHICH IS TRUE).

However, I felt that those were  the very reasons that it was so good.  The evil is whatever the viewer  wants to make it.  This is not to say that the people who hated this movie  have no imagination, just that you will get out of it only what you take  with you.  Personally, I thought that the acting was incredible.  I mean,  they acted completely normally, and the scene in the tent was fantastic  when she talks to the camera.  Her nostrils were flaring, she was crying,  shaking, utterly terrified.  I have never seen anyone do thet good of a job  on selling fear.  This comes as such a refreshment after waiting for years  for a scary horror film.  Basically this message is to say that you should  see it and judge for yourself.  Don't listen to us.	5.0	A watershed work	1999-10-29	0	0	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1ERDXS0QLEVKB	rzaster	"""The Blair Witch Project"" is certainly not the worst of movies that I have seen; it's nowhere near the top of the list of the movies that I disliked. I think that the main reason did not like this film is because of the way that it was shot. The film was produced as a documentary to give the viewer a feel that what is going on the story actually happened. In fact, the movie is supposed to be a tape that was found by the documenters. I'll get into the plot, which involves the documenters in a little bit. If you get sick or naseous from watching something that seems to be all over the place then this film is not for you. There is no control over the camera as it wobbles.; but all of this was done so the feel of the film would be more realistic. And it worked, as a matter of fact.The plot is very, very simple but is not that great. A group of teenagers wander off into the woods for a search of a mythical witch for a project. The movie documents the travels of the teens, the documenters, through the woods and this is what you will be watching for the running time of the film until the climax.This film is not scary unless your mind easily scares yourself. In the movie you see absolutely nothing that is scary; you don't even see the Blair Witch. Any horror will not be triggered by scary images but by your mind processing certain clues as to what is happening. If your mind does this then you will be very scared. If not, you'll have a good time laughing throughout the movie.Why did I give the movie just two stars? I didn't like the documentary type feel in the production of the movie and the acting was not all that great. If this film had a bigger budget, better acting talent, and a plot that was a bit more believable then this movie would probably be one of the biggest horor movies ever produced. Unfortunately, none of the above was put into effect.Happy Viewing!"	2.0	Only Scary if Your Want to Be Scared	2002-06-26	3	1	2
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1PAP1J6STMKZL	Sair K	Blair Witch is more than a movie about 3 people being chased by a witch. Its quite a psychological drama. Slowly, bit by bit you see the characters go more and more crazy. And in the end I was left to wonder if there really was a Blair Witch or if it was all in their heads as they became more lost and delerious. The dialogue was believable because it wasn't pre-reheresed, or even pre-written. The actors acted how they would have if this was really happening to them.

I don't watch any tv and so missed all the hoopla about this film and thus was truly mezmerized by it. Yet I did know the story was  fictional.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2W5HTMUJXQ4PJ	Sark	I was one of the many who bought into the Blair Witch hype and bought my ticket confident I wouldn't be sleeping well that night. The result? I was terribly dissapointed, and most definently wasn't scared.This movie is just not scary. I still don't understand how anyone could find this scary. As one reviewer said &quot;You would be scared too if you were out there in the forest with them&quot;. That point is irrelevant. Of course you would be scared if you were out there, but you'd also be scared if you had Micheal Myers or Freddy Kruger out to get you. I obviously didn't find the choppy documentary style the film was made in as effective as many other viewers. All it did was give me a headache (I was sitting in the very back row of the theatre!) and had to look away at some moments because I was feeling sick. I do give the creators credit though. They definently made a lot of money.The whole effect of not seeing what is out there didn't get to me at all either. All you hear is some sticks breaking, the kids cussing, and repeatedly asking &quot;What's that sound?&quot; That is just not scary. It's downright stupid. Maybe I should make a documentary in my house at night and record all the creaks and cracks my house makes at night, and try to pass it off as a horror film. I really don't see what the difference is other than the setting. The cussing, staring at the black screen hearing &quot;what's that sounds?&quot; asked a bunch of time, gets very old, fast.Even the climax I didn't find terribly frightening or suspensful. Just one whole big let down. The bottom line is it's just not scary. Anyone who knows me can testify that I'm not terribly hard to scare, but I went home that night after &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; and slept soundly. This is probably one of the biggest hyped and overrated movies I've ever seen. Don't bother with it, unless you're prone to get scared at little bumps in the night.	1.0	&quot;Scary As Hell&quot;?

I dont think its either of them i wont say i wasnt disapointed, i was but its realy not that bad and i do think its worth seeing once.  Now the second time you watch it then you can call it boring.  The only reason it works the first time is it has you in suspense.  It is a little scary but very repetative which bores you and takes away the scare.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2GFV1FXCVK8QF	"SBB ""SBB"""	In my opinion, the reason for this extremely wide range of opinions, is that the movie's ability to scare us depends on our ability to let our own  mind fill in the blanks. That's whats wonderful about this film. It gives  us a terrifying premise, and allows us to incorporate our own worst fears  and scariest &quot;boogiemen&quot; into the darkness we see. For those  viewers (and there are many) who are fortunate enough to have an  imagination which complements this unique &quot;mockumentary&quot;, they  are rewarded by a truly frightenening movie experience that few films can  rival. I would recommend this film to anyone just on its premise alone.	5.0	PEOPLE WITHOUT IMAGINATION STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!	1999-10-28	1	0	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AIV0J3W2JK9Q5	SceaduDraca	"Ego clouds many reviews of a film like this. When I first saw this film it was after a lot of the hype had dwindled off. However, this is one of the most effective horror movies I have ever seen. I can't say it scared me really, but neither could I say it didn't. I never had any troubles sleeping, nor any bad dreams related to it. But, what I can say is it draws you in and draws you in deep. Why is the question.We have all grown up and seen many documentaries. As with Peter Jackson's ""Forgotten Silver"", the look and feel of a documentary used in fiction can trick the mind to believe it is real even if you know better. It is just something conditioned in the mind. Consciously, you know better, subconsciously, you're snared deeper and deeper into the story. Probably the most effectively done story that falls under this category of mock truth was not on film, but on radio, Orson Welle's newsy broadcast of ""War of the Worlds"" which generated a very real nationwide panic.To me, ""The Blair Witch Project"" was very reminiscent of documentary videos seen, among other places, on a TV show I grew up with hosted by Leonard Nimoy called ""In Search Of:"". In fact, Blair Witch, to me, 'felt' much like several documentary videos I have seen of the search for 'Bigfoot' or, the yeti. I recall one in which they turned on their recording gear in the night because of strange animalistic sounds in very close proximity and totally surrounding their camp. Who knows, that may have even been part of Blair Witch's inspiration. Regardless, I say excellent job to its production crew in capturing such a genuine feel and making it so effectively 'creepy'.And a little hint about the nature of the nay sayers. They are usually the ones whose nails lost the greatest length while watching the movie they will later say 'stunk'. I know this from watching many like that. Watch them, it's hilarious. Video it, it's priceless. Much of my volunteer work with animals required the ditching of my 'male ego' as a liability. So I find it hilarious to see how much it dominates others and their image."	5.0	Forget ego clouded reviews, this film is in one word - Effective	2006-01-28	7	4	3

The idea that someone would go into a wood which is unknown to them, without a guide of some sort is ridiculous.  Especially when they know there could be some strange goings-on.The characters are all paper thin and the dialogue was attrocious.

There is no excess of blood and gore, no cheesy special effects, and you don't even see the monster(s). This film works because less is more, the little sounds you hear watching the movie late at night, preferably in October, really instill a feeling of dread in you that lasts long after the movie is over. this is my favorite horror movie, because there is no guy in a hockey mask running around with a knife,(or is there?)and it really gives you the feeling of an urban legend gone awry. This film is better off watched only a few times a year, ideally Halloween, because if you see it too much, then you will become immune to all the subtle little bumps in the night.

Blair Witch did  it. &quot;Deliverance&quot; is a classic parallelism.  When I sat down all  comfy and cosy to watch my tape of the Blair Witch Project, I had to pause  two times to both rejoice for finally getting scared by a movie and to  settle down in order to continue the flick! We can all place ourselves in  REAL moments of our lives when we got THAT scared. From noises to  hallucinations to the REAL monsters we have in our memories, this movie  will bring them back! My brother and I were camping eight miles from  anywhere, USA and were terrorized by a rabbid canine of somekind. This  creature circled our tube tent, snarling and poking at it for about four  solid hours, only pausing when it killed and ate a smaller creature that  had this awful, high-pitched scream!

After True Romance(1993),The Blair Witch Project is the best movie i've ever seen. The  hand-held camera action and the many ad-libbed scenes made the movie more  realistic than most,especially the claustrophobic feeling we shared with  the characters being lost in the woods. This movie is an instant classic  and I definetely hope to see more of Heather Donahue,Joshua Leonard and  Mike Williams.These actors have incredible talent and will go far.

I've never seen it before but I've always heard the name over the years and decided I might as well see it for once. The way the movie was filmed made it feel like the viewer was there, in the woods with the 3 main characters of the film. I enjoy this greatly. There is a lot of wooded area outside my house, and I was afraid to go outside to smoke a cigarette after watching this movie! Really well done.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A35SHXI131ADGZ	Sillage	I saw this movie years ago, in a bursting-at-the-seams packed theater. I had to wonder at the people bringing their three year old to this movie and the constant crying sort of proved my point. There was also a very drunk person that puked in the aisle more than once during the movie. And yet somehow I was trasported to a place of such terror that I almost puked in the aisle myself, and longed to join the child and cry out loud. This mock-umentary is so suspenseful and frightening I have to put it right up near the top of my list of all time scary movies (simply for the scare factor, not for the plot). At that time I computed the movie in my brain as a true story, not a work of fiction, and I've never been able to fully rewire the association. And therefore, any time I go camping I require prescription drugs to get anywhere close to sleep.

I enjoyed this movie because I thought it was creepy enough to keep you interested, especially if you think this is a true story and these 3 kids are actually going through this ordeal. Some parts were boring but some parts again, were really creepy with the tent scene, the symbols hanging in the woods, the children's laughs, the friend that goes missing, etc. The most creepy part has to be the ending in the old house. Cool ending. Some people hate this movie and some love it. I think it will never be forgotten however you look at it. It was ""different"" but in a good way.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1K0LPMMIU2UV6	S. Moon	There is something funny about my likes and dislikes about movies, I am influenced when I hear a lot of opinions of others about a movie.  What is more funny is I'm influenced opposite of what others say.  I heard a ton of crap about this movie, after it had been out for a while, the week it came out it was the bee's knees of horror film.  I watched this movie exactly 10 years after it came out and the day before I watched it I was still hearing how horrible this movie was when ever other horror movie was mentioned.  THAT is how influential this movie is, it ALWAYS comes up in a conversation on scary movies.  But it is always said how lame this movie was, not crap-your-pants-keep-the-lights-on-until-morning-for-a-week scary it was.--DISCLAIMER--You will notice that the people that were not scared by this movie watched it with a large group of people that TALKED their way through it.  Those who watched it with a few people that were silent through out were freaked out by it.  Those that watched it alone with the lights out were scared for life.--END OF DISCLAIMER--I did the later, I gave the movie the benefit of the doubt and watched it alone one weekend with all the lights out.  Needless to say the sounds on the disc menu before starting the movie is enough to keep me up till day light with all the lights on.  It was such a sneak attack for me, I did this because I thought it was going to be a lame snore fest.  I was wrong, and now I have to live with it for the remainder of my life hoping I simply end or an all mighty creator burns it out of my brain.Strangely enough when I went to watch it, on it's 10 year anniversary, I could not find a copy, anywhere.  I think it was the first thing I downloaded illegally.  I saw it at Target this year for $4.99.  I feel guilty for stealing since it accomplished it's goal on me so so well, but I didn't even want to pick the case up.  I'm renting it on netflix, keeping it for a day, not watching it, and then sending it back to make up for this though.  I don't know, I might watch it just to see if it still holds up a little over a year later.  I mean, the second time you watch something it is never as scary, right?  Like an idiot I might do it alone in the dark, just to give the movie the benefit of doubt.	5.0	Have you ever heard tons of bad stuff about a movie before watching it?	2010-11-10	5	2	3

They're used to the &quot;status quo&quot; of film making, getting the visuals to do the thinking for you. This film different in that it dwelves into your primal fears of the unknown. You start to care about the characters and give some doubts about ever going camping again. I believe there was a movie that used a slightly similar technique, &quot;JAWS&quot;.

Maybe the unbelievable hype earned it a backlash, or the omnipresence of the internet campaign, but when I left the theater after seeing it (while still in limited release, before the hype had become tiring) I was devastated. It doesn't really warrant more than one or two views; I guess the essential gimmick at the movie's heart can't sustain more than that, and it may be unable to deliver those chills on a small screen in your living room, but give this film the respect it's due. If it was a gimmick, it was incredibly successful. Either way, it's method of hinting at atrocities, and building dread through the simplest of methods worked perfectly and I'll never forget how I left that theater with legs of jelly in a state of shock almost.

Everyone has some sort of fear whether it be monsters in the closet, or being lost in the woods.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3HBE6T8TM56KM	Spudnuts	Most of the negative reviews of this movie fall into two categories:1) It wasn't a &quot;real&quot; movie. 2) They were cussing a lot.This movie is not for lazy viewers who want the whole premise spoon-fed to them  and then massaged down their throats. You have to THINK. There are many  questions left unanswered here, but WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT? Perhaps some  viewers could make a leap and actually expend some effort/imagination to  meet this movie half-way instead of demanding a witch in a big scary  costume with special effects and plastic fangs.As for the cussing, I  suspect a lot of conservatives view this as part of the satanization of  America and put this in the same category as &quot;South Park&quot; as  exhibit A in the decline of western civilization. The swearing is not  excessive. This is a crutch for those who just found the movie too  challenging.	4.0	Tough to digest, worth the effort...	2000-01-18	1	0	1

You're lost in the woods and you're too stupid to follow a body of flowing water until you actually get somewhere useful?  Really?  I was suckered into this movie, only because a friend invited me and paid for it.  For what seemed barely an hour we waited for this tacky washed-out, jumpy, grainy bad-sounding excuse for a homemade movie opener to end (don't waste your time with Blu-Ray!  LOL), so that we could finally get to the main story.  Then it was over.  That WAS the movie.  There was some mild suspense, but it rapidly faded as the characters slipped from lost, terrified teens to mindless, wandering, whining saps.  There was a little creep factor as well, but certainly not enough to rattle my cage or keep my attention for very long.  I remember all the TV commercials and movie previews for this one.  They really hyped it well.  Someone made a truckload of cash on this super low-budget kick in the crotch.  The average viewer might like this one as an annual Halloween night scare flick, but it's not for me.  Watch it with Halloween III: Season of the Witch.  That was a better production and much more competent story.  Sad.  Very sad.	1.0	Underhanded Marketing at Its Finest	2010-08-24	10	3	7
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A5Q25ZRVYKKRB	"S. Shah ""Hi-Fi 4 Ever"""	I originally saw the Blair Witch Project on its opening night.  At that time there wasn't much information about its content or origins.  I was fortunate enough to see the Blair Witch documentary on television two weeks  prior.  I, as many of you might have been, was under the spell.  I wasn't  sure if the documentary type film was 100% fiction or if it was the real  deal.  Such ignorance on my part, resulted in one of the most profound  cinema experiences I have ever had.  Many people out there refer to the  movie as melodramatic, but keep in mind, this film was never meant to  become a mainstream blockbuster.  This was a small independent project, and  it was designed to capture real human emotion: fear, anger, hatred, guilt  in its truest form.  True emotion should not be labeled melodramatic, the  emotions portrayed in most (99% in my opinion) movies is bogus and not  realistic.  There were no heroes, unlike most cinematic flicks; there was  just unadulterated emotion.  I must say I can't blame many people for  feeling let down about the movies hype.  The movies was a one time shot,  best enjoyed when it was new.  I purchased the DVD out of respect for the  actors, and creators. The respect was born from the true feeling of terror  and confusion I experienced in the theater.	5.0	Blair Witch: A movie misunderstood.....	2000-05-04	6	3	3

Sure it's possible to imagine your own ending, but it just wouldn't be funny anymore,  no matter how creative you are.The Blair Witch Project follows suit.  The concept may have been intriguing, but after an hour and a half of  watching three film students being frightened as they wandered through the  woods...there was no conclusion.  One of them disappeared completely.  The  other two stumbled upon an abandoned house looking for him and, when they  reached the basement, dropped their cameras.  One can assume that the witch  got them, but it's never made clear.  The movie just disintegrates.I  felt that the acting, while not flawless, definitely had an impact.  Personally, I did not mind the shoddy camera work since it played a part in  making the movie realistic.  But no matter how innovative an idea is, and  no matter how realistic a film succeeds in being, there's no making up for  a flimsy, fragmented plot that neglects to tie up its loose ends.	2.0	Unsatisfying, even with an overactive imagination...	1999-12-11	1	0	1

Then, they all thought it was dumb!  How stupid is this country anyway?  How could anyone think this was real?  Like footage of some mystical being slaughtering three kids is something they'd just throw into the theaters for you to kick back and eat popcorn to.  Well, I guess the film makers succeeded in what they were going for;  They made a film for about two bucks and made a mint.Personally, I don't see what's so scary about this.  Maybe I've been desensitized over the years by the number of horror films I've seen.  I do admire the effort.  These guys made a blockbuster out of practically nothing(just like Night Of The Living Dead in the 60s).  But, after watching it, I just didn't think it was much of anything.  I saw it in the theater before the hype(thank god), and the film only took up about half of the screen.  I was wondering when the rest of the friggin' movie was gonna come on.  For the most part, this movie is about an hour and a half of bickering, arguing, running screaming into the darkness at the sounds of a shaking bush(who on God's green earth would go running blindly into the pitch black woods if they saw or heard something scary?  Especially if you were lost anyway?), two or three ""creepy"" moments, and a not-so-grande finale.  I had no sympathy for these ... kids.  I didn't give a rat's behind if they were Blair Witch-ed or not.  Throughout the film, our ... heroes are supposed to be lost and walking in circles.  However, it never once looks like they're more than 20 yards from where they parked their car.  They never seem that deep into the woods.I did like the last five minutes from the whole crying-frightened-apology-snot-confession to the end.

This video is about as boring as it can get, even more so than the theatre, if possible.  This movie is an excellent product of hype, but like all  products of hype up there, it falls short.  Unlike all products of hype,  however, this falls insanely short.  Hell, it doesn't even fall.There  are a few things that plauge the BWP.  First, the horrendous acting.  If I  can get paid a lot of money for just screaming and pretending that I'm  scared (rather poorly, I might add), then please sign me up.  These  &quot;actors&quot; have almost made an art out of it.  Another problem: get  a script!  There is no plot or storyline or even an event that happens in  this movie that attention to detail (or even not to detail but just  attention in general) could have ironed out.  The last problem I will talk  about is the camera view.  Good idea, people, but quite nausiating, as  well.This movie has turned me off of any &quot;innovative horror&quot;  out there, and one less person will see the sequel.

Then I watched it  again, and again, and again, and became (painfully) aware that it is,  indeed, one of the most effectively psychologically damaging films that I  have ever seen.  Why?  Because you never, ever get to see who or what is  out there doing this to these people.  Without a visible bad guy, the  imagination of the viewer is allowed to wander in any direction, most  likely toward the viewer's most inate fears.  And for God's sake, I don't  care how cool you think you are: if you woke up in the morning and found  your camping partner's teeth bound up in a bunch of sticks, you'd be pretty  justified in freaking out.Now, I am not a wimp when it comes to films.  I've sat through Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Exorcist (yawn),  all of them, countless times.  Not one film has ever done to me what this  film did.  Just the noises outside of their tent on their third night  camping, even before their tent gets pounded and they run screaming into  the woods, makes me quiver and shake.  Ooh-wee, I love that scene.All I  can hope is that they don't run the whole thing into the ground with sequel  and planned prequel.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3I69IXPTDVKQF	Stephen B. O'Blenis	"By now the story of ""The Blair Witch Project"" is probably familiar to everybody who even remotely follows movies: three student filmmakers journey into the woods with a load of camping gear and handheld filming equipment to record a documentary on the local legend of the Blair Witch.  There, they encounter the terrifyingly supernatural - or do they? - and their ordeal is caught on tape.Most of what they actually see is never captured on film - the result of the darkness of the woods, the occurence of phenomena at night when everyone's asleep until it happens and the cameras are off, etc.  A lot of great horror movies culminate in grand finales that finally give some kind of explanation as to what's been happening; this isn't one of them.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" achieves its greatness in a different way, getting progressively more enigmatic instead of less as it approaches the end, and remaining completely believable even during (in fact partly because of) the seemingly almost unexplainable paradoxes.  But if you need definitive answers at the end of a movie, then admittedly you may not be captivated by the Blair Witch.As an example of the paradoxes, as they attempt to move through the forest in a straight line one sometimes gets the impression the characters are moving in circles.  To me it didn't come off as indicating that the characters were stupid, or that there was a mistake in the filmmaking; but that something truly something truly outside the ken of normal human experience is happening, and that there's a danger in these woods more intangible than a physical prescence, which may or may not exist in conjunction with this bizarre warpishness.  The fact that they continue filming throughout the nightmare did not come off as preposterous, which it certainly could have if not handled correctly.  Instead, cut off and pretty much defenceless, with no understanding of what's happening and unable to perform what should (were things normal) be the relatively uncomplicated task of escaping from the forest, the camera is their link to sanity, to record and in less ominous moments - should any materialize - to try and understand what's going on about them.  It's also not dissimilar to explorers lost in the Antarctic or such places, suspecting they may never get home, continuing to record events in their logs and diaries.  A scene in ""Blair Witch"" in particular that really brings the horror home is where the girl is looking right into the camera and addressing her family and her friends's families directly.Without giving anything away (which would be somewhat hard to do with a movie that leaves so much open to the individual's own interpretation) the end moments contain some of the most chilling and unforgettable images and suggestions in horror history, and fit perfectly with the rest of the film.Horror has a long history of tales told in this 'recording' manner, including the novel ""Dracula"" being told entirely through journal entries and the like.  It was inevitable that in the age of video cameras and the like this kind of plot device would find its way into horror movies as well.  Probably most people are familiar with the movie ""The Last Broadcast"" which actually came out a bit before this (althouh I'm not saying ""Blair Witch"" is a ripoff).  There's also ""The St. Francisville Experiment"", which is about a documentary crew trying to film ghosts in a house rumored to be haunted - very good movie, although not on level with this.  A couple of others that tread the same approximate ground which I haven't gotten yet but plan to are ""Red File 66-095: Strawberry Estates"" and ""The Wicksboro Incident"", which I thought I'd mention because other Blair Witch fans might also want to give them a look."	5.0	Mystery, Paradoxes And Terror	2005-11-27	3	2	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3EC8I67I2QQA1	Stephen Cromwell	I originally saw The Blair Witch Project in the theater, and it was one of the few movies I've ever seen to really have a powerful, lasting effect on me.  The movie really captures the essence of horror, I think.  No jump scares, no gory mutilations or slimy monsters.  Just 'something&#34; out there that the protagonists and the audience never see and can't hope to really understand.To this day I can't spend more than a few minutes in the woods without a creeping fear that I might stumble upon some voodoo stick figures or cemetery stones or something similar.  I love the movie, it strikes a perfect balance between setting up the mythos, then taking the characters out of their comfort zone and then letting them &#34;find&#34; their way into a situation they can't handle.  The performances are all quite believable, their fear is palpable.It's not a great movie if you are looking for a gory slasher, or an anticipatory terror-fest with a huge scary monster, but for a believable modern fairy tale that &#34;could&#34; maybe be real, and will stick with you for a long time, you can't do much better.  The Blair Witch Project will always have a place among my favorite movies, ever!	5.0	Still a powerful horror movie that will remain a classic for ages!	2014-03-09	1	1	0

I had to spend most of 1999 avoiding all the hype and articles on this movie, so  that I could watch the movie on DVD when it came out and experience it as a  whole. As such, I enjoyed the movie a lot and am not ashamed to admit I had  major goosebumps for the entire end of the movie when they were in the  house. No, it didn't give me nightmares, but it was a very original movie  and deserves a lot of respect for that fact alone. Plus, it is pretty good.  As for the DVD, it looks like they've got all the features turned on,  including a full-length commentary track, supporting documentary, and  &quot;lost footage&quot; with even more stuff.

If your like me and get engrossed in the film plot and characters regardless of how good the film is, then you'll find this film an absolute stunner.  True, the  characters can be pretty annoying - but they're also realistic too which  makes the plot all the more feasible. If you've got an imagination and can  let yourself get dragged into the whole atmosphere of the film, then you  can't lose with this. On the other hand if you need large explosions,  gratuitous violence and massive budget FX to keep you happy then it's  probably not for you.	5.0	The thinking persons horror film	1999-11-21	14	9	5

A more interesting and  fulfilling plot would be the clubbing to death of the female lead for lack  of talent - in the least it would have relieved us of her endless  yammering.  An unoriginal waste of film, I'm left wondering if the  filmmakers have ever been on a camping trip.	1.0	Hollywood Hype	1999-10-26	0	0	0

I am dissapointed to see the bad reviews written about this film by people who obviously didn't give it a chance.  If they were to watch this film alone, late at night they would encounter a whole new experience.  If you  let it, this film can involve you like no other.  I consider myself a  hardened horror fan desensitized by excessive dark viewing.  However, this  film resensitized (does that word exist?)me and invoked feelings of fear  and impending dread that I never thought possible from a film.  By the end  my chest felt bruised from the onslaught of my breath holding.  Many people  have criticised the ending of this film, but maybe that's because they  didn't listen at the beginning to understand it, as has been the case with  many of the people who i've confronted.  In my opinion the ending is one of  the best and most disturbing i've seen and will haunt you for weeks  afterwards.  The low budget of this film is what makes it so great, it  achieves using no special effects what other films spened millions (and  still fail) on trying to achieve.

This low-budget gimmick film was hyped way beyond its capacity, so it's amazing that it still almost delivers on its promise. If you can set aside your motion sickness, the documentary style actually works.  Along with the non-star casting and improvised scenes, it lends a chilling plausibility to a scenario which, if filmed conventionally, would be banal.  These are clever choices: because it feels real, the film doesn't need a digital monster or any other kind of jaw-dropping effects to build a delicious suspense and deliver one of the most terrifying climaxes you'll (n)ever see.  And that's what horror is all about.	3.0	Clever choices make it work	2002-12-04	2	1	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A33WAL3OX30NN4	Steven R. Hills	The Blair Witch project was a good psychological horror film.  It doesn't have the blood and gore of the more traditional horror films, but you are scared because you can get into the characters shoes through the first-person camera work, and see them slip into hopelessness and terror as  they realize that they are up against something way beyond their league.  The ending was especially disturbing (if you pay attention at the beginning  of the film).  It has stayed with me for over a week.  The best part is  that it is done without the aid of music, gore, or a final confrontation.  I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  Also, to those who ask,  &quot;What's so scary about rocks and stick figures and sounds?&quot; I'm  not going to insult you, but I will ask, &quot;If you heard scary noises  outside your tent in the dead of night and woke up in the morning to find  grave markers (the piles of rocks) placed outside your tent, signaling your  impending demise, wouldn't you be a little scared?  If you were being  stalked by who-knows-what that had the potential to kill you and you found  figurines that were obviously witchcraft oriented hanging up everywhere,  wouldn't you be scared?  If you were being stalked and had to stay yet  another night in the woods where whatever-it-is was, wouldn't every little  sound terrify you, not to mention human footsteps and unseen children  laughing and crying at 3:00 AM?&quot;  If I knew that something were  stalking me and I couldn't get away, I wouldn't need a machete through the  head to scare me.  Nor, do I think, would you.  My only complaint was  that the connection between Rustin Parr and the Blair Witch was not  explicitly made in the film (you have to go to the web page,  or watch Curse of the Blair Witch to really see the  connection).  Taking a few extra seconds of footage to make that connection  explicitly would have helped.  My advice: Watch it, and be very, very  afraid.	5.0	A wonderful movie, well-worth watching.	1999-11-09	0	0	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1P5HSM15HWNWV	"Steve ""xtcr7"""	"THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  Most people either loved it or hated it; middle ground is not an optional piece of territory.  I loved it.  I'll tell you why.  One word--ingenuity.That about sums it all up for me.  Sure, there's more there, there actually is a deep, dark horror to it, a spoiled seed which could be the starting point of a magnificent mythos, but I think the element which exists in greatest abundance within the world of the mysterious witch is a categorical and clever kind of resourcefulness; it is filmmaking which is so anti-Hollywood that Hollywood was powerless to ignore it.  After all, we are fascinated by what we fear, are we not?  And a bunch of kids with a few cheap digital cameras riding a powerful idea to a box-office gross north of the century mark can be pretty scary to old, stodgy powerbrokers, let me tell you.PROJECT is a faux documentary edited together from reels of footage discovered a year after the disappearance of three young, amateur filmmakers by the names of Heather, Josh, and Mike.  Their goal was to explore the rural legend of the Blair Witch, a supernatural force said to haunt the forest near the township of Burkittsville, Maryland.  Everything is pretty harmless, benign at the beginning; there's a lot of hamming for the cameras, a surplus of joking and chiding at the expense of each member of the trio, and the conducting of interviews with a few of Burkittsville's finest, who recount different aspects of the evil Wiccan lady, a creature they believe is responsible for many missing and mutilated people over the years.  A creepy tone is set with the cool campfire tales related to the documentarians, the most terrifying being the one about Rustin Parr and his malicious slaughter of several children (he eventually comes out of the Black Hills Forest with the chilly enigmatic proclamation ""I'm finally finished"").  But the real action takes place when the group begins to explore the woods; strange things start to show themselves, like odd rock formations, unnatural hanging childlike figures formed from twigs, and the unearthly song of young kids in the distance.As time goes on, the friendly dynamic previously enjoyed by the threesome denigrates into quick decay, the pressure of the foreboding unknown takes a trying toll.  They walk `round and `round the woods, becoming more and more lost, all attempts at orientation null and void.  Adding to the animosity is Heather's seemingly blind ambition; Mike and Josh just want to figure a way out of the mess, but she is unflappably determined to continue with her thesis, caring more about photographing the twilight-zone incidents they encounter than with formulating a plan of escape.  One of them is marked and then taken by the witch; the remaining duo eventually happen upon a most haunted house and an extremely blood-shocking horror hidden inside.Perhaps the most intriguing construct of the film is the fascinating high-concept idea at the lowest level: imagine what clues one would find on media generated by people missing for a long, long time.  When I first read the tagline promoting the project, I was immediately struck by the utter perplexing nature of such a springboard; it filled me with a bursting sense of curiosity which would have to be satisfied as soon as possible.  The next vital component is the main mechanism of presentation: the documentary format (or, the documentary of the documentary format, at the least).  Upon first inspection, it works; it takes you fully in and makes you feel as if you are watching a nonfiction account of what happened in the woods.  However, upon subsequent viewings, it should be noted that some flaws not previously noticed eventually become conspicuous; these shortcomings aren't necessarily specific, tangible things, they tend to be more abstract in nature.  Simply put, the first time around, you accept the film as an investigative exercise in reconstruction of a potential crime scene, it is nothing more contrived than that; but, as one becomes increasingly familiar with the work, a sense of staging and plotting is made apparent, ruining somewhat the magic of the virginal viewing.  In fact, the issue of the missing map is something that probably should not have been included, as that became a point where the viewer definitely intimated an intrusion of an obviously fictional hand upon the desired effect of verite.  (Going into the film, I thought I was going to see a narrated, paranormal-type show one might find on the History Channel at Halloween time; in some ways, I think this would have been a more ideal route, although not by much- for the most part, PROJECT's design does its job.)The acting talents of the three main players are finely suited for the nature of the material.  Of particular note is Heather Donahue, who seems to have a disproportionate amount of training and polish in relation to the other two; but this can sometimes work to her detriment, since too skillful a job can detract from the insouciant, unconscious demeanor that a director would want to see in this kind of a role.  Remember, these are three ordinary kids under extraordinary circumstances; it would not do for any of them to suddenly show off any sort of technique learned from an educational institute- instead, the ""everyman"" approach is best.  There probably was a bit of overacting at times, particularly when the arguments really started to rise along the temperature gradient, but it was kept to an acceptable minimum.But let me go back to where I began: I just loved the genius level of this movie.  We don't have a lot of money, so let's scare the pants off of everybody by devising an invisible menace, let's play with the minds of the audience and make them gasp by giving them high-resolution terrors instead of complex CGI algorithms.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2BMDY4WJIDGG7	S Tuffnell	I wanted to see this to see what all the fuss was about as it caused a major stir at the time. It is one of the first hand held camera film mockumentary flicks that resulted in a tirade of mockumentaries, the recovered footage genre, including District 9, Apollo 18, and [REC]. The hand held camera work is at first interesting and then nauseating and you wish they could keep it still. The ordinary production is all part of the set up to the famous ending that still makes me shudder. It is the creepy atmosphere and odd feel of the film that makes it scary, rather than what is said or the actual events.The fear in the eyes of the players is quite disturbing as they look genuinely terrified. This translates to the audience also and one never knows what to expect next. The dialogue is virtually improvised and even the actors do not know what is going on adding to the morbid fear. As such this is a curio that is worth seeing once and then perhaps forgetting.The realism of the content, as though someone left a camera running and now we are seeing it unfold, was an innovative idea but has since been flogged to death. The sequel 'Book of Shadows' is one of the worst films ever made as it completely removes the doco feel with hand held cam and suffers terribly as a result.	3.0	Chilling scenario and gimmick works.	2012-07-28	0	0	0

I was so dizzy from the camera going up and down and round  and round that I could barely keep up.  Also the language is filthy.  The  female explorer should have her mouth sewn shut.  It was trashy and vulgar.  When the film ended (thank goodness) my husband and I just looked at each  other with dumbfounded stares and debated on whether we should ask that our  money be refunded.

I was thoroughly  terrified, I don't do horror films well, and left the theatre feeling  relieved that it had been a matinee.  I still have doubts as to the way the  film was created, having three &quot;no-name&quot; actors portray fear the  way the did leaves me a little skeptical about it being fake.  Their  terror was so believable to me that I realized at the end of the movie I  had been shredding paper napkins in my lap through the whole thing.  The  &quot;shakiness&quot; of the film was a little nauseating but tolerable.  You actually feel like your involved.  I left breathless and shaken.  The  end was a clencher and freaked me out.

If they were to watch it alone, late at night they would experience a whole new experience.  If you  let it, this film can involve you like no other.  I consider myself a  hardened horror fan desensitised by excessive dark viewing.  However, this  film resensitised (does that word exist?) me and invoked feelings of fear  and impending dread that i never thought possible for a film.  By the end  my chest felt bruised from the onslaught of my breath holding.  Many people  have criticised the ending of this film but maybe that's because they  didn't pay attention at the beginning to understand it, as has been the  case with many of the people that i've confronted.  In my opinion the  ending is one of the best and most disturbing i've ever seen and will haunt  you for weeks afterwards.  The low budget of this film is what makes It so  great. It achieves using no special effects what other movies spend  millions (and still fail) on trying to achieve. Don't let other people  decide for you, get this film, watch it ALONE (otherwise don't bother) and  form yor own opinion.

The fact that it made millions is obscene, but at what cost?  Mass disappointment, I guess.  I mean, take the acting, for example.  After about 20 minutes I wanted to  kill the chick myself.  The other two I could care less about, but then,  that's the hook in this movie isn't it?  You have no choice but to wander  the woods with these three idiots who are terrorized by a pile of rocks  that seems to be following them and the badly made stick men hanging in the  trees.  The fact that, given a compass, a map, eight park rangers and  bright yellow arrows marking the way out of the woods, these three would  still be lost has no bearing on the plot.  I was hoping for a great big  bloody ending, but apparently even that wasn't in the budget.  And really,  all three of them couldn't have carried all the fully charged camcorder  batteries needed to film this thing. I do give it credit for making more  money with a shoestring budget than any movie ever...and on the flip side,  had Hollywood got ahold of this, they'd have spent 50 million, hired great  actors to do it and it would have been a flop.	1.0	Should have been called the &quot;keep audience awake project&quot;	2000-05-11	21	15	6

If your after stunning actors with perfect teeth, then go  elsewhere ( although Heather is definitely very shagable). If its gruesome  monsters and great special effects then watch The Haunting. If you crave  heroes who orchestrate a fairy tale ending against all odds and pulls the  babe in the process, then watch the rest of the crap Hollywood regurgitates  all over us.  But, if you have at least half a brain and understand the  monstrous evil lurking in the unknown, then watch The Blair Witch Project.  It'll scare the shit out of ya. At a certain level, even though we never  see it, the viewer has to be aware of this thing hunting them through the  woods. But put that aside momentarily and focus on the film's portrayal of  three people getting lost. Not just lost, but serious shit lost in the  middle of nowhere with no hope of rescue and death an outcome that is more  than possible. Anyone who has been in the situation can relate to this film  and its portrayal of the TERROR that gradually envelopes the characters.  First comes the joking that they're lost, then comes the cold realisation  they are lost, then comes the blame and recriminations followed by  despair,anger and finally terror. Three people, three different  personalities, all falling apart one by one in three different ways.  Brilliant.  Add to that this thing hunting them through the woods and the  final scene in THAT house with THAT screeching from Heather.  It all adds  up to a frightening experience not to be missed.  My hat goes off to the  actors and crew for the scariest film in two generations since The  Excorist. In the end , I don't care about the snowjob they pulled on us by  allowing us to think it was real footage. If that did happen, and that  witch and those woods did exist, and three people got lost in there, I  think this film is as close as anyone could come to capturing the horror  that would unfold.	5.0	The Blair Witch Project - Anatomy of Misadventure	2000-09-03	4	3	1

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2YW1TL9ZR3URI	"The Mad Bostonian ""Steve"""	Ahhh going all the way back to summer 1999 when this little gem was released, i was in high school, a bunch of my friends saw this. we were divided after the show, some did not like the whole documentary style look, the shaky camera use, some said it wasn't scary, some like me thought it was brilliant and scary, the old adage less is more... certainly worked in this case.The movie isn't about the budget--- sure it was made on a small small budget and made a huge profit, what helped was that we as viewers were first introduced to an aggressive online ad campaign--- the film makers had the website, had the back story of the three lost film makers, the history of the Blair Witch, it was all very clever because I remember when clicking through the website I couldn't tell if this was real or not, or based on a true story then as word got around when this movie was getting popular it was all a clever rouse by the film makers themselves. Now you see these online viral ad campaigns everywhere, all in part have to thank the Blair Witch movie. remember 1999 was still new to online information, Yahoo was coming around and there was the big Website boom, look how far we come now with the Net.And the whole documentary style film making is not new, the film makers have alot to owe to the Italian Cannibal movies Cannibal Holocaust for the inspiration, where that film an anthropologist finds lost footage of a trio of film makers that disappeared in the jungles of the Amazon. This film was made back in the early 80s. So this kind of style is not new.The movie itself is shot in grainy black and white, and showing no gore no violence, everything is implied. At night in the woods all alone, your mind can take over, hearing every little twig break, every leaf rustle, will make your hairs stand on end. It's this simplicity that makes the film work. There's a scene where the three filmmakers are in the tent and they hear strange sounds coming from the woods and they shine a flash light out in the the black abyss and it doesn't penetrate nothing, the light, doesn't illuminate who or what is out there, total blackness is all around them and it's only then they feel most vulnerable, the filmmakers playing on everyone's general fear of the unknown, the darkness and one cannot anticipate early morning that much faster to make it safe again with the daylight. i want to say it's also a character driven movie, the interactions between the trio of documentary filmmakers and the stress they are put through as they get lost deeper and deeper into the Maryland wilderness. Everyone is on edge and on the brink of flipping out and going postal on each other, but throughout they try to stay calm and keep that inner beast inside them.Let's fast forward to 2009, the new hit movie paranormal Activity, borrowing heavily from Blair witch, using less is more, this time in a house that has a demonic spiritAnyways Blair Witch is a classic horror movie, our parents generation had the exorcist, Jaws, Psycho, Night of the Living dead, people who grew up in the 80s had Friday the 13th, Nightmare on elm street, The Thing, what do we got? Scream (crap), Urban legends (Yawn) I know what you did last summer (definitely crap), Final Destination and its subsequent crappie sequeals (Blahhh)Blair witch is a rare gem for us who grew up in the 90s and got bombarded with crap movies like I mentioned, this one was a diamond in the ruff.

However, truth be told, there are a lot scarier and a lot better made movies out there that you could be seeing.  Yes, this is an okay movie. It got a lot of hype because of it's  &quot;inventive&quot; documentary style (this has been used before, see  some cult horror movies). It got too much hype, so much that the final  product couldn't live up to it, especially if you're seeing it now.While  Blair Witch does have some genuinely scary moments, they are precious few.  I kept getting the feeling that the film's style was just a gimmick rather  than an actual attempt at making it look like a documentary. There is one  thing in this movie that does stand out though - the performances. They are  not that amazing, but compared to a lot of today's horror movies they are  quite good.

I tend to become very disturbed easily, and this film is one of the ones, (like in the title) I never want to see again.I have always found that psychologically disturbing techniques in horror films are the most effective in frightening audiences. I have observed that I have been severely more scared by films that are 15 rated (to American readers, this would be, just below R rated I think?) than 18 rated films (American ""R""). This occurs because of lesser violence, and greater effort based in fear.The Blair Witch Project basically documents three friends who go into the fabled woods in Blair Maryland, to explore the myth of the ""Blair Witch"". What the three friends in encounter, is like nothing ever explored in horror before.I do want to ruin this film for future audiences, so, let me say just this -Do not expect violence, and do not expect splatter.I think this film works better watched alone, however, it is really equally as good with friendsI recommend headphones too, audio is fairly important.And get ready for the ending scene, and the following silenceEnjoy"	5.0	Brilliant, but never again	2011-09-21	3	3	0

Williams, Joshua Leonard.Running Time:  82 minutes.Rated R profanity and some tense situations.Perhaps using the most ingenius marketing scheme of all time, this hoax of a documentary film grossed over $130 million in the theatres and became one of the most talked-about horror films of the past decade.  The cinematography is nothing more than a hand held camcorder, following around the likes of supposed &quot;actors&quot; who spend most of their time running around the woods paranoid out of their minds (which is obviously supposed to be scary).  Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez claimed that the film was restored footage from a group of filmmakers studying an urban legend and then were never found.The premise is simple enough--&quot;Blair Witch&quot; is a documentary recording the events of three filmmakers who meet an uncertain fate while investigating the old legend of the Blair Witch deep in the midst of the Maryland woods.  Despite the fact the entire film later was found to be a fake, it is a film that does have some tense moments, especially the finale; however, &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; is certainly not a modern day horror masterpiece by any stretch and will probably more likely succeed at making your feel sick to your stomach due to the jerky camera movements than anything relatively frightening on screen.	2.0	The Blair Witch Project  (1999)	2004-05-31	10	5	5

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A8M4WE1MT4R4O	thomas angelo zunich	I don't appreciate the fact that before this movie even began to surface, they were saying this was ACTUAL footage found frum ACTUAL real life students that were ACTUALLY still missing or perhaps murdered.  That really  peaked my interest in this film beyond comprehension, being a lover of real  life docudramas ( of the dateline variety).When I found out it was all a  hoax I was left with this sinking feeling inside, like I had just been  bamboozled.  Why on earth lie to people in order to promote a movie?  That  is very low.Animosities aside, I knew I would end up renting this thing.  I understand the whole concept of what they were trying to accomplish.  It  is an &quot;alternative&quot; movie, seperating itself in the conventiality  of the tradional genre of a film.  It is very 1999, very now.What I got  mostly frum Blair Witch was a sense of urgency, like if you put yourself in  their hiking boots.  You feel lost, isolated, afraid.  It can have it's  caustrophobic effects on you as well.  As stupid as this may sound, there  were also some aestetic moments in Blair Witch, like when it was raining  and you could see the soft, dewy raindrops cascade against the pine trees.  Is that giving this film too much credit or what?I felt connected with  the characters throughout the film.  By the end it felt as though I knew  them and I did mildly care about what was happenening to them.  This is  exactly what I didn't want to happen though.The end is tragic and very  disturbing.  Only disturbing if you have (all together now)... AN  IMAGINATION.  That is the secret to this film, it plays with your  imagination, if you have one.I will probably end up buying The Blair  Witch Project, adding to it's grosses.  I am so jealous of the directors!	3.0	Little House of Horrors	1999-11-07	0	0	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1FESO3NA2HD1I	Timmy Busce	The finest element in this film is its originality. Hollywood flicks that preceeded it, all became carelessly similar. The exclusion of complete scripting, rehearsing, etc. and the creative storyline is what gives this  film its great realism. The excellent improvisational performances by the  three filmmakers is an underrated aspect. One decided flaw in the film is  the constant usage of profane dialogue (137 'F' words were counted  altogether). You don't need to be a censor to realize it gets to be  obtrusive. Due to the incredible popularity the film had gained, its  fiction is no longer a secret, which takes away a good deal of it's  effectiveness (Imagine if what you were watching was real). Overall this  movie has become an instant classic, it has opened doors for new worlds of  filmmaking. It's a good bet that it will continue to frighten audiences for  generations to come.	4.0	Greenstate Pictures	1999-10-24	0	0	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AR4F820R46I1S	Timothy E. Jones	During the summer I was laughing at the whole concept of the movie, (mainly because my viewing pleasure was mawred by the fact that I was seated behind three hecklers). Anyway, I saw the movie on DVD at 1am, and  it freaked me out (and I don't scare too easily).The movie starts out  looking like it'll be some cheesy yarn, but it's not. In fact, this movie  is nothing less than genius, with the very gradual build-up to the  traumatic ending, and the making you believe the characters could have  really existed (which is what makes the movie work, you believe they could  have existed, and you're watching their &quot;found&quot; videos).If you  watch only one Horror movie . . . this is it.	5.0	The SCARE of the Blair Witch	1999-12-17	1	1	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3HZSD46WVMW1Q	Tim Rosenstein	This movie's success all hinges on schtick. Here's what needs to happen for you to like this flik. If you can ignore the glaring faults of this film as a film, and simply enjoy the &quot;When animals attack!&quot; sort of voyeuristic aspect of it, and not get sick from the terrible camera work, then you'll probably like it.However, personally I didn't like it because: it was obvious to me when the actors were &quot;acting&quot;. Mostly the movie is them running around arguing, then getting freaked out. Most of it was unscripted, though there were certain things that needed to be discussed, divulged, spoken, etc., at certain points in the movie. To me it was painfully obvious when this sort of thing was happening. Check out the long-haired guy's line about &quot;why was my stuff covered in that blue stuff?&quot; It's so forced.That's the main problem with this movie is the same thing that everyone says is so unique and great about it: there's no script. So, what you got is some kids screwing off in the woods. It all seems ultra-natural because, well, it actually is a bunch of footage of these three people screwing around. But, when it comes time to make an interesting and compelling movie, the efforts to do so just didn't work for me. The forced plot points, the planted creepy things, the background story, and especially the shaky premise.They're supposed to be film students, yet none of the footage is good enough for an actual documentary, rather it's only good enough for a mock-documentary horror flik that's relying on schtick for it's appeal.If I would have found it scary at all I could have forgiven everything else, but it didn't even scare me.	1.0	Undeserving of so much praise	2001-11-09	8	4	4
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A18UVEZMFDRQ9U	Tim Sharp	The pitch:  'Lets make a film about ...  a fake scarey documentary and then lets kid people  into thinking its for real'The subtext: 'Hollywood can still be beat'I don't think that one point  of view can adequately capture this film. By the time of its European  release any mileage to be gained from the original pitch had been long  since spent. So like a sheep I followed the rest of the herd into the  cinema. Personally I found this a very boring film, maybe because I was  determined not to suspend reality and get into it. However, about a quarter  of the way into the film various groups of pale shaking teenage girls were  leaving. On the way out I scared my girlfriend by shining a torch in her  face. That film really got to her, she wouldn't talk to me for days.	3.0	The Blair Witch Project	2000-03-14	1	1	0

The premise is clever,  but I found the characters annoying, the storyline slow and the abject  horror to be missing.  In the end, it was just another bad B-horror movie  without the blood and gore.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A176IA89VGH46M	Todd Bovair	Because in truth, the movie taken on its own merits only earns 3 stars. I gave the movie an extra star because this movie was entirely original when it came out, no one had ever seen anything like it before. let me go over a few things you will want to know before you buy/rent:1) The movie was made for only $40,000. There are NO special effects, no known actors (in fact, the main cast is only 3 people), no pro lighting, and was filmed with handheld cameras (complete with jerky camerawork).2) the profanity in the movie has been much criticized. Most seem to think its because the actors couldn't come up with anything original and creative, so they just kept swearing. I totally disagree. The way the actors talk in this movie is HOW PEOPLE TALK. Ever overhear two people talking? They swear like there's no tomorrow! The conversations in the movie sound like 3 20 year olds talking, which is what its supposed to be.3) The film is not very scary through most of it. Original, yes! Scary, no. The last 5 minutes, however, are in my opinion the scariest minutes of film ever shot. EVER. I don't get scared by movies, and I felt like I was going to have a heart attack watching those 5 minutes. DEFINITELY worth viewing the movie for.4) This movie is incredibly original....but thats not to say that original is always good. The movie drags a bit, only because most of it involves the principal actors endlessly bickering with each other. It gets pretty old pretty fast. However, that doesn't negate the fact that this was an important film (breathing new life into the horror genre) and an overall good (not great) movie.5) The acting is not great. Its certainly ok, just don't expect a DeNiro 'Raging Bull' tour de force. You won't get it here.If you haven't seen this movie, you REALLY SHOULD see it. You probably won't want to see it more than once, but the first viewing is pretty amazing (and that scary ending!).	4.0	4 stars may be a little misleading....	2005-12-12	3	2	1

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2ILHD7W0HIAVW	Tony R. Tucker	Sift thru the more than 1700 reviews on Amazon at the time I write this and you'll see a lot of 1 star and 5 star reviews.  People seem to love this movie or absolutely hate it.  My first knowledge of this film was a brief blurb from Roger Ebert talking about an upcoming film and he showed footage from the Blair Witch Project of people running and screaming in the woods at night.  My first thought was, &quot;Is this a student film?&quot;It never occurred to me that the film was real, even though it was marketed that way, and even though I saw the Sci-Fi Channel's excellent Curse of the Blair Witch special, all before seeing the actual film in the theater.  The reason I mention all of this is because I think a lot of people resent being hoodwinked into thinking the events they were watching were real.  To that I ask &quot;So, you paid money to see a snuff film and now you are disappointed?&quot;  As the credits rolled in the theater I heard more than one group of people note the actors names and say &quot;See, I told you it was real&quot;.  At that moment they loved the movie.  People had been jumping out of their seats and hiding their eyes.  Imagine their disappointment when they found out the people on the screen weren't dead.  I bet they were angry enough to trash it to anyone who would listen.  My two closest friends in the world did EXACTLY that.  They both admitted liking it until they found out it was just a movie.  Now they talk about how it was the worst movie ever.  Why the change?I guess I should actually review this DVD.  Despite my original worries, this is not a student film, although it was certainly made on a student budget with student equipment.  The 3 unknown actors were simply more convincing than any $20 million per picture actor that has hoisted an Oscar.  Remember, people watched this and thought it actually happened.The plot was simple; Three students go into the Maryland woods near Burkittsville to investigate sites haunted by a local urban legend, the Blair Witch.  They get lost, they find more than they expected, weird noises surround them, someone disappears, and it culminates in a search of the ultimate Blair Witch location.The DVD is great, not only for it's special features including a great commentary track, but it also features the full length Sci-Fi mock documentary Curse of the Blair Witch, which gives background on the &quot;myth&quot; of the witch and &quot;interviews&quot; with people with knowledge of the legend.Please, if you have not seen this movie, watch it with watching a work of fiction in mind.  As a movie, it is spooky, and the isolation and building terror of the cast will draw you in.  There's nothing that will change the monds of people who watched the film with the wrong mindset.  Instead, I urge you to see it for what it is; a very good, scary film.	5.0	Love it, or hate it	2004-04-08	7	3	4

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A26PCTV7JTC11X	Trader Mort	Ever since Orson Welles unintentionally fooled audiences with his 1938 broadcast of 'War of the Worlds', the mockumentary has been an interesting subgenre of film making.When it is done well, such as the BBC's 1992 'Ghostwatch', it can be extremely effective. But the show must be both believable and entertaining at the same time.Blair Witch Project takes an original, but generally unsuccessful try at it. When the film came out, it made use of 'viral marketing', i.e. using the Internet to essentially create an fabricated urban legend to convince people, by word-of-mouth, that the the story of a film crew that mysteriously vanished was true.As a result, a mini-sensation occurred that propelled what is essentially a student-grade film, into the mainstream. Some people, just like those listening to Welles in 1938, were convinced the story was true.But once the film is taken out of this sensational environment, what is left is a pretty banal, torpid film. The movie is a lot like watching somebody's vacation video. In fact, the film could be titled 'Lost in the Woods', since it seems most of the middle part of the movie focused on the fact the trio couldn't find their way back. The psychological aspect of the movie is interesting, but not enough to compel somebody to watch it strictly for entertainment purposes.With the Internet/urban legend hullabaloo stripped away, Blair Witch Project is shown to be what it is - a film that is mildly interesting and not very entertaining. Instesd, grab 'Ghostwatch' if you can.	2.0	Original take on an old genre	2005-03-17	4	1	3
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A361WQA2D2NE1I	"""tragiclad"""	The premise of this film is very simple. In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeard in the woods while shooting a documentary. A year later their footage was found.I've always felt that in horror it's better to tell than to show. The Blair Witch does a great job at this... jerky hand-held camera movements and out of focus shots, leave you wondering just what it was that you saw.What was it that Heather found after Josh disappeared?What was that off in the bushes?What happened in the basement of the house?There's always just enough of a glimpse for your mind to register something's there - but never a good enough glimpse for you to be fully sure what it was. BrilliantThe film hinges upon your belief that what's going on is absolutely real, and the filmmakers did a pretty good job of that. The website played it completely straight, giving photos of the crimescene, images of the tapes and film that was found and a history of the Blair Witch. A mockumentry, The Curse of the Blair Witch, played on television around the time of the film's release, fleshing out the details of the history and background. Convincing interviews with bereaved parents, local law officials and so-called experts all lent an air of credibility that what you were watching was real. I can recall, at the screening I saw in '99, a woman in front of us asking her husband, &quot;was that real?&quot;.Of course - now it's common pop-culture knowledge that the film isn't real - taking much of the oomph out of it. Skim through the comments at imdb, and you'll see what I mean.My recommendation: Watch the mockumentry. Give yourself an hour or two and then watch the main feature. Then head out for a weekend of camping.	5.0	One year later his review is found....	2003-10-26	0	0	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AYB0IXBPBJ20A	"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee"""	In general, when a movie is really really good it's something you want to watch on a reocurring basis. Bad movies you tend to stay away from. But that isn't the case with Blair Witch. Not for me. This movie reeked. It was  atrocious. And yet I'll probably watch it everytime it comes on. Probably  because it's so bad that it's entertaining. The acting, while not the worst  I've seen, isn't very good. Heather Donahue does her best, but the other  two guys are repetitive, babbling...  It's no wonder Hollywood ain't  exactly knocking down their doors for acting gigs.As for the fright  factor? There is none. I've heard some people say this was the most  terrifying movie they've ever seen. I suppose they never saw the Exorcist,  but everybody's entitled to their opinion. I'm just curious as to why  anybody would say that. Is it because the movie looked &quot;real&quot;? It  was also horribly acted, which kills off any connection to reality in my  opinion.  Is it because the threat is never shown? So basically you'd be  scaring yourself to death. That's not the mark of a good movie, that's an  overactive imagination.  The mark of a good film to me is one that makes  you feel what the characters are feeling, and I never got the honest  impression that any of them were scared.  Bad film, but entertaining to be  sure. Just not in the way the director/producer hoped.	2.0	Terrifyingly Bad	2000-08-09	0	0	0

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2VBWR2QF1NIY2	Trevor Dunnahoo	Blair Witch shouldn't have appeared on movie screens across the midwest, and allover America. This is what made everyone HATE this movie. The Blair  Witch Project is strictly an art flick. Anyway, I LOVED this movie. Every  scene just kept gaining more momentum and then POOF! It scared the hell out  of me. The actors couldnt have done a better job. They really did a good  job. So what if the scariest part was when they see a bunch of voodoo  sticks? It had eerie parts that make you terrified. Some of the visions in  this movie will stick into my mind forever. Anyway a great movie for  Halloween, Friday the 13th, or just about anytime!	5.0	I actually LOVED this one!	2000-08-04	3	2	1
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A1CUAKU0H308FD	Trinity	First off, let me warn you: If you are someone who is terrified by gory horror with lots of blood, guts, and murder, this movie is NOT for you. Avoid this movie the best that you can.But to everyone else, let me start off with, this is one of my top three favorite horror movies of all time! I'm a huge horror buff, so I've seen a lot of horror in my life; this tops it all. :)The Blair Witch Project is about three college-aged kids who go off into the woods to explore the legend of the &quot;Blair Witch&quot; for a project at school. The three of them are: Heather Donahue, the solid leader of the group; Joshua Leonard, the cameraman; Michael Williams, who takes care of the sound. They decide to go camping over the weekend and have a planned out trip through the woods. The first night, everything seems to be going as planned. But soon they find themselves in a terrifying reality that may cost them everything. Eerie sounds begging to haunt them outside so that they cannot sleep at night. The noises continue to become more intense as their journey deepens. They find voodoo witchcraft things all over the place. One of them is missing. The map is gone; they walk in a straight line all day and end up where they started. They are lost, hungry, tired, and hunted.In reality, three amateur actors were sent out into the wood with two cameras- a black and white and color- and a sound system. They kept their real names for the film as well. Everyday they were given notes on where to go, and some of them had &quot;special&quot; directions. During the filming process, the actors truly were cold, tired, and hungry. They were given very little to eat, had to sleep in the cold outside, and didn't get much rest. All of this enhanced the film's quality.The originality of this film is something like I haven't seen in a very, very long time. Made on a terribly low budget, the filmmakers come up with an excellent horror story sure to chill you imaginative people to the bone. I have found that it's especially scary to those who have lived near/in the woods at one part in their life. For the first 11 years of my life, I lived almost out in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by trees and wildlife. This movie scared me in particular because I know what lurks in the forests at night. :)I would also suggest, should you have the DVD, to check out the commentary. I thought it was very interesting to see what these three actors had to go through to make the film what it is; it's also interesting to see how they made a lot of the night sound scenes work.This film is, all things considered, an imaginative and highly original film that is sure to be refereed to as one of the best horror movies for a very long time.**NOTE** I have been told that this film is based on the legend of the Jersey Devil. Look it up on google to find out more. It's actually pretty interesting :)	5.0	Fantastic Imaginative Horror- But NOT For Gore Fans	2004-03-17	5	1	4
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A243HY69GIAHFI	tropic_of_criticism	The triumph of this movie is not the story it tells. Rather, it is the uplift it must give to the hearts of small filmmakers everywhere.  If this can enter the $100 Million Club then surely their better-crafted pieces must have a chance of making serious profit margins as well.This storyline is as implausible as Ricky Martin selling out a stadium to an audience of people who are there for his &quot;artistic integrity.&quot; My pet mouse following the scent of cheese five miles away would've had a better chance of getting out of the woods than these morons.  It just makes no sense that the &quot;woods&quot; could've been more than a thicket in densely-populated Maryland.  What rural plot of land in Maryland wouldn't be completely transversable in a day, walking slowly?  And even if worse came to worse, were these people so INCREDIBLY stupid that they couldn't have marked their trail?  Some might well say that by the end they were so exhausted and delirious that rational thought wouldn't have occurred to them.  But this is a bankrupt theory.  One of the people might've broken down in this way.  Two, maybe.  But all three of them so completely fogged over that they couldn't put together a logical plan for...WALKING?Ahhh, but what about the witch, I hear you saying?  Did she not change the shape of space-time around the woods so as to make it impossible to walk out?  Did she not cast a spell upon them to make them forget basic navigational skills? Please.  It's impossible to walk out because the filmmakers NEED it to be impossible to walk out.  This magical property of the woods is the _deus ex machina_ of the plot, and the story is inevitably cheapened by it.Oh, sure: the ending rescues the filmmaker's credibility. They do know how to induce terror in an audience, however briefly. And this &quot;payoff&quot; is the result of some convincingly-acted character metamorphoses.  But throughout the vast wasteland that was the film's setup we in truth learn only two things: 1) the filmmakers disregard their audience's intelligence and 2) $20 is an awful lot of money for a movie we could've seen at the dollar theatre downtown.What's amazing to me about this film was how it depended upon its website and media hype to tell its story.  Exceptionally clever marketing, of course, but bad storytelling.  If you had no access to the media before you went to see it, the film would be all but incomprehensible.  Without the hip website, and background documentary, you've really got nothing of substance in the film. Since the marketing was so pervasive and effective, it's hard to imagine doing, but try to conceive of going into a theatre with no prior knoweldge of the film.  My guess is that you'd walk away scratching your head.  I mean, think about it: what happens?  People walk around, people walk around some more, objects are left tentside, and *boom* there's your witch blurring by the camera for thirty seconds.  The ending is scary not because we've been told an engrossing story which feeds us little tidbits along the way to turn the screws of terror in our minds.  It's not scary because it could happen to us.  It's scary because all the marketing TOLD us it was scary.  It's scary because there's a prelude at the beginning of the movie which says that the protagonists snuffed it and after an hour you 'feel' that it's about time for that prelude to come true. Because you know in advance it's not going to end well for our three adventurers, there is no mystery.  And without mystery, there can be no great horror.  There can only be the effect of being on a roller coaster looking down the tracks of the drop that's coming.In fact, this movie reminds me very much of a ride at the Magic Kingdom. Not Space Mountain, which is an ordinary roller coaster made frightening because it's entirely dark.  No this is maybe Splash Mountain.  It's so heavily hyped and all the lines are so long that it must be the best ride EVER.  You see that big flume at the very end of that ride as you're wating in line, and you think this ride is going to be GREAT.  And maybe to some people it is.  But when YOU get on it, you realize it's just a carefully created environment populated by a lot of dancing animatronic bunny rabbits singing a song until the very end, when--briefly--you have the wits scared out of you by what you had already seen on your way in.  And as the car comes back into the station and you wipe the fractional amounts of water from your face, it suddenly hits you: THAT'S what I spent the last hour waiting in line for?There are better ways to go bump in the night, people.	2.0	This li'l kiddie ride ain't no Space Mountain	2000-04-18	1	0	1

I heard about this movie and am definitely looking forward to watching it.  Actually I am quite curious to see if its better than Paranormal Activity, which seemed to be a common comparison along the lines of low budget horror flicks.  I had seen Paranormal Activity and wasn't impressed at all, or even the least bit scared about anything in the movie.  So a few recommended me to this one, and I had watched a little bit of it alone, just to get the feel for it.  The movie has seemed a little bit strange so far...but as I said before, kind of on par with the way they started Paranormal Activity.  Basically with just video camera's and trying to make it look like the movie was actually filmed by kids or something to that effect.I am looking forward to watching it within the next few days and hoping that it meets up to my expectations and at least gives a little bit as far as suspense and being slightly scary.I was completely IMPRESSED with how short of a time it took to get it here and the personal thank you written on the packing slip inside.  I would definitely look at buying from Green Splice again for other movies and books that I might have an interest in depending on what they are selling.	4.0	Haven't Watched It Yet	2010-07-22	2	0	2

If you don't,look elsewhere.(Maybe Urban Legend 3 will be coming out soon!)Puke! You need to watch this movie alone with the lights out to really be able to take in the eerie atmosphere that this movie creates. This movie delivers tension that I haven't felt since first watching The Exorcist as a teenager back in the early eighties. Many people criticize this movie for the way it was filmed,but for me therein lies the beauty of it. The mood of the film would have been severely hampered by a big production. I love gore films(Dead-Alive,Dawn Of The Dead,The Beyond,City of The Living Dead,just to name a few),but this was one of the few films to actually get under my skin. This film didn't need gore or a big budget,just good acting,a good story,minimal props and a couple of cameras. Part 2 was not worthy as a sequel,but ends up being just another horror movie that I could live with or without. I hear Part 3 is in the making. Hopefully it can capture the intensity of the first one(doubtful). Somehow picking up where the first one left off could only help. Maybe write Heather and the guys back into the picture. I wish I could write the third installment myself!(I wouldn't disappoint fans of the original!) Thanks for your time.	5.0	The best horror movie in years!	2002-01-19	4	2	2

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2O8ADNE534RSD	"""vassar2000"""	The Blair Witch Project is a scary, original, and well-acted movie.  Without any spectacular special effects or any computerized monsters, The  Blair Witch Project proved to be one hell of a scary movie.  Why?  Because  the viewers have to use their own imaginations.  We live in a time in which  Hollywood dictates what we should like, dislike, love, hate, fear,  etc...The Blair Witch Project goes against that and allows US to create  what is lurking out there in the woods and what the Blair Witch looks like.  We all have our own unique images/ideas of what the Boogie Man looks like,  what lurks under our bed, in our closet, and in the dark...and these  images/ideas terrify us.  Therefore, when we take our own unique  images/ideas and project them into this movie, we are scared witless and  the movie becomes scary.  People have told me what they thought the Blair  Witch looked like, what the mysterious children who ambushed the tent  looked like, etc...and their descriptions were all scary. People who say  this movie isn't scary haven't got imagination...They remind me of what  Daily News Critic Dennis Hamil said recently:  People want sensational  effects to tell them what to feel and when to feel it.  The acting is so  amazing and realistic and the camerawork so raw and amateur-like, that you  wonder whether this mock documentary IS in fact real.  You see three  ordinary people (which could easily be any one of us) deteriorating and  going crazy before your eyes...that is also scary.  However, if there is  one thing that bothered me about this movie, it's the actors' usage of two  cameras instead of one.  The movie would have been better from a technical  standpoint if the action didn't shift between two cameras.  If The Blair  Witch Project is playing under the pretense that this footage was found  after these three teens disappeared, then how did the  &quot;discoverers&quot; edit the footage from both cameras to make a  seamless timeline of events?  The switching back and forth between both  cameras makes it look like the people who found the tapes were superb film  editors who knew how to piece the footage together to make one seamless  timeline of events.  Or, maybe this is just the director's way of saying:  It's only a movie, kids.	4.0	Into the Woods with Blair Witch	2000-08-03	1	1	0

The  only problem was that before I saw the movie, I saw one of the actors on  Jay Leno.  So when the ending came, I knew it wasn't true.  And the ending  made the whole movie.  The actors/actress should have stayed hidden to make  the movie more believable, then it would have scared the daylights out of  me.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A21TQAX8R4IPF0	"vladb ""vladb"""	A spit in every major Hollywood studio's face, to say the least, and the second film of 1999 to learn a lesson from MTV's atrocious programming and put it to superior, even revolutionary use. With &quot;Run Lola Run&quot;  it was the relenltess pace and non-dependence on dialogue which created a  sublime effect, a near return to the silent era. &quot;Blair Witch&quot;  took the channel's utterly false reality of home-video footage and  documentary-style acting, transforming it into perhaps the most realistic  falseness to ever grace the silver screen. The enormous buzz that  surrounded this amasing horror movie (which never aspires to be more than a  cheeky genre entry) has started an undeserved yet equally strong backlash,  mostly by jealous film-students at first, then by the spoiled masses which  could not comprehend anything beyond Will Smith's special effects-ridden  vehicles. Misunderstood both by the critics who hailed it as the next  cineamtic movement and the audiences bombasted by the hype, &quot;Blair  Witch&quot; should be taken at face value; although currently that is  practically impossible to do. The degree of scariness in the exploits of  three young idiots (types all too familliar to everyone who attended  college) doomed to perish in the hanuted Maryland woods will largely  correspond to one's own level of sensitivity, but regardless of how  frightened the film makes you, it amounts to an experience of gleeful  delight,(akin to the great &quot;Evil Dead&quot; series minus the  cartoonish gore), of taking part in something new and refreshing. Of course  the overall execution is not totally original, deriving mainly from  &quot;The Real World&quot; and an obscure 80's Vietnam flick called  &quot;84 Charle Mopic&quot;, but what does it matter? Nothing, repeat  NOTHING spurts out of the blue - (a classic case in point would be  Tarantino inspired by Goddard and Melville inspired by Carol Reed and John  Huston inspired by the 20's expressionist cinema and early gangster films).  &quot;Blair Witch&quot;, while not transcending its genre, still has a  share of pure visual artistry, some probably unintentional. A certain  beauty lies in the shots of Heather Donahue's white shape jetting through  the dark forest, or the omnious rays of sun glittering in the evening  trees. The amateur feel the directors generate is but an expertly-crafted  illusion and therein lies the film's ultimate pleasure.	5.0	revolutionary film fataly hurt by excessive hype!	1999-12-02	6	3	3

It is the epitome of waste.	1.0	The dumbest movie I've ever seen	2010-02-08	11	2	9
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AS9J0WAKEKZ5M	Walter Grimace	For the longest time I've tried to scare the living daylights out of myself with horror movies. I've heard that The Blair Witch Project was a really good movie ( and scary ) so one day I rented it and watched it that night. First of all, I knew that these weren't actually real people lost in the woods. But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and went along with the movie. That was all I had to do for it to mess me up, scare the living daylights out of me, and shock me out of my skin. Wow. What a great movie. I can't quite understand why people wouldn't like this movie. If you're prone to motion sickness and saw it in the theatres then okay, I'd understand that. Then there are the people who think that you need a litre or so of blood and gore for every minute of a horror movie. I actually prefer movies to be bloodless. It takes a lot of guts in a horror movie not to show a lot of guts. People say that the movie wasn't scary. Although this movie was made to strip you away layer by layer psychologically and bruise your most cherished and primal instincts and fears, perhaps some people... uh... are reptiles ? I can't figure it out. If you haven't seen this movie, go and see it with an open mind. This movie will crawl into it and stay there for a long time.	5.0	You Want To See Something Really Scary ?	2002-06-02	2	0	2
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2IWURBS85BJR1	Watcher	I think everyone made too much of a big deal out of this movie, I really think it is a waste of time. I wasn't going to watch it in the first place but my friend saw the previews and decided it's THE scariest movie and we  should all go watch it. I would usually step out of a movie feeling like  i'm in a dream or something, still reviewing all the scenes in my mind but  this time I left feeling stupid for paying money for it. It's true that the  way they did it- Making the actors face certain situations without knowing  about them earlier- and by that acting 'for real'- Is definitely a cool way  of doing it, but still overall- I don't think it's worth anyone's time and  attention.	1.0	A waste of time	1999-12-07	6	2	4

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A25PM9JGHPU8EI	Wes	One of the most frightening films I've ever seen was a Sasquatch film in the 70's, which relied upon unseen sounds and a creepy atmosphere in a dark forest. I could hardly contain my glee when I heard the premise of this story. It just SOUNDED so good. The disappointment was crushing after watching this. I, like thousands of other people, was DUPED. These three wusses deserved whatever was waiting out there for them. I was rooting for their doom, as I couldn't take the whininess. It was horrible. I will say that the ending was intriguing, actually a little scary - but 3 minutes of fright DOES NOT redeem the idiocy that preceded it. On a technical note, what you see here is the video transferred to film version - NOT the hard videotape version, which I would have preferred to see. The muddy video-to-film look makes it all the worse for watching.	1.0	Could have been so much more - a complete disappointment	2004-10-31	27	18	9
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A3KWXO6QE62Z5E	Wes Martin	Most people won't agree, but THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is definitely scary sometimes.  What ruins it for some people is motion sickness and/or how much arguing goes on in the movie, and how they don't have decent dialogue.  But come on.  You have to put yourself in their shoes.  What if you were in the middle of the woods in the middle of nowhere when it was pitch black outside, and heard noises that sound like footsteps all around you?  You WOULD be freaked out.  What makes this movie scary is the thought that there is something evil all around you, and it's too hard to see anything.  An excellent movie recommended for any TRUE horror fan who believes that movies with scary atmosphere are scarier than movies with dumb masked killers.

The BWP is useful just to get out into the world and have an impact.I like to bushwack in the woods and it just  isn't believeable that three people could wander around the woods for so  long that they couldn't have found a telephone line, logging road, house  etc . . .I think the movie makers should have shortened the timespan to  about two days, that would have been believeable.  Yet the movie plays into  our sense of fear of nature, of being outside of our homes, our cars, our  routine lives and puts us into something new.The actors acted like  teenagers/adolescents and that was a strength too.  But with a low budget  non traditional movie you've got to get all the details right and this one  didn't quite create the perfect ambience to make everything fall into place  for me.	3.0	10 days and nights wandering around in the bush is too long	1999-12-22	0	0	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A2F7WVM7A8VB9F	Will	This movie was not gory, this movie was not bloody, and this movie doesn't have a conclusive ending. What makes this movie good? The reality of it. If I had just picked this up, I would say this is real. Sure they say the  &quot;F word&quot; alot, but they're college students. What do you expect-  Shakespeare? Lewis Carrol? Or even Dr. Seuss? No, these are college  students. Crude in mannerisms and speech, but still have their hearts in  the right place. The beginning was funny, but also crucial to the ending,  which Alfred Hitchcock himself could not have done better. You never know  what happened. This adds to the horror- what people are afraid of is  the  unexplained. To tell you the truth, the first ten minutes or so in the  woods are very boring. I was about to agree with the people that this movie  was  &quot;all hype, no story.&quot; But it was like the first chapter of  the Hobbit- you have to get past the boring to get to the good stuff. These  ten minutes is why this movie only gets a four rating instead of a five.  This is the only movie that has ever really scared me. &quot;A Nightmare on  Elm Street&quot; and &quot;Scream&quot; made me jump, but never actually  scared me. This movie has done what countless others couldn't do. I'm glad  I own the tape because every time I see it, I find something new.	4.0	The only movie that ever scared me	2000-06-30	1	0	1

Kelsey ""seeker of truth"""	"Remember that guy or girl in your school who refused to listen to the Top 40 radio stations not because he/she didn't like the music, but because too many other people liked the songs and that alone made them ""corporate trash""? This is the film made for him/her, and only that type of person. If this describes you, then buy a copy tout de suite so you can watch it in the company of others. After watching, if they are people who actually watch films in order to be entertained, they will ask, ""Why do so many people like this film? Nothing happened. It's a bunch of annoying, worthless college punks running around in the woods swearing at each other"". You then can put your ""snob"" on and denounce them as ""populace filth"" who cannot grasp the sheer genius of a film where nothing happens on the screen and everything is supposed to be one's imagination. When they leave, you can then throw your copy aside because you will never watch it anyway unless you have the opportunity to belittle those who cannot ""get it"".Another reviewer called this the ""reality show version of a horror film"", and to me, nothing describes this film better or demonstrates exactly what was wrong with the entertainment world in the 1990's as well as that comment. People became burnt-out on the flash and glamour of the 80's and, as with every other concept in human history, decided to go the other extreme and make music that was dull and boring, sung by ugly people (which would had been fine if they had been guitar wizards or something, but their musical skills were by and large pretty horrible too), the models looked like junkies,clothes were so hideous that bums wouldn't wear them now, and the reality show was born.God I hate reality shows. They destroyed decent writing and camera work for at least a generation and gave every freak willing to swallow rat's brains a spotlight usually reserved for people with real talent. Hence, this film was born. The ""actors"" are extremely annoying (as other reviewers have written, the viewer begins to wish for their slow, painful deaths a few minutes into the film), the story was beyond weak and nothing annoyed me more than the lie that the producers put forth that this was some kind of documentary (once again, as someone else has said, how could a camera survive on its own in the elements for a year?), and the jerky, haphazard motion of the camera might very well make you ill. I know that we're supposed to be the MTV generation and all have ADD so badly that we can't concentrate on a single image for more than half a second, but let's vote to stop that now! It's insulting to everyone under 40 that Hollywood assumes that we just don't want or can even tell if a film has quality production.To close, if you love films shot up people's noses, with no dialogue besides the ""F"" word, and that are so jerky the viewer feels worse than after riding in a plane during severe turbulence, this is the film for you. But if you're a pretentious schmuck who enjoys torturing others with films that not even the actors' parents would watch twice, you'll enjoy it too."	1.0	A Film for the Indy snob in Your Life	2008-08-17	16	4	12

I am squarely in the 'love it' camp and give it 5 stars. The creators have gotten more atmosphere out of less budget than I thought possible. It just goes to show budget isn't important if you have good ideas. This pseudo-documentary of three collegiate slacker types lost in the Maryland woods WAS hyped to death, luckily I ignored all that and discovered what is now one of my favorite movies of all time!Yes, this movie has a lot of shaky-seasick cam, and yes, it has a lot of swearing. This isn't why it's effective of course! I think it scares people (me especially) for 3 reasons: 1) As mentioned by other reviewers, you never see the Blair Witch. This allows your imagination to run free with the creepy sounds and images you ARE given. 2) There is a curious balance for a horror flick, hardly any blood and gore...heaps of bad dream images (particularly the lil' house in the woods...I think I've been there in a nightmare!) Also lots of scenes in pitch blackness (that nust have been intense in the theatres). Not only was eliminating the usual gore a way to deal with the low budget of this film, but in suspense, less is always more! Think of JAWS, some of the scariest parts are when you DON'T see the shark!But my favorite point, and one I don't think many people notice or mention is 3)...the contrast of the spooky supernatural witchy elements with the very believable, everyday terror of the way people mistreat each other. As the situation worsens for the characters, they begin arguing and lashing out at one another more and more. Since at the beginning, everyone is chummy and likeable, I find that this disintegration of their friendship to be unsettling and scary too...sort of a mirror image of the external threat of the Blair Witch. Many reviewers say the people in this movie spend too much time arguing...but I think that's intentional. It simply puts another level on the 'bad vibes'. I'd cite examples but I don't want to spoil anything worse then I already have!So if you want to see an example of the amazing atmospheres that can be created in a movie on a ridiculously low budget...and you want to be scared so bad that your soul temporarily leaves your body...check it out!	5.0	Something Witchy This Way Comes	2003-10-20	4	2	2

The aspect of Blair Witch that I enjoyed the most was the fact that I did not know how it would end.  The script was not cookie-cutter, and I found the acting to be as good as the script (or lack thereof).All 3 actors do a fine job of allowing us to forget they are acting.  The performances are subtle and convincing, and almost every scene carries foreboding and fright.  I would rate this as one of the scariest movies of our generation.Many will disagree, but I still love to watch this movie.  It frightens me every time.

6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	A10W5NFZ9PLX4K	"Yih Dzelonh ""yih_dzelonh"""	I only recently saw The Blair Witch Project on HBO or some other cable station and after viewing it had mixed feelings.  Before I had ever even seen the movie, I was extremely skeptical and had heard extremely mixed reviews from critics and viewers alike.  I had heard that it only cost about 36,000 dollars to produce this movie and the majority of the comments from viewers indicated that the movie was a total debacle and not suspenseful in the least bit.  But, I nonetheless kept an open, unbiased frame of mind before watching it, wanting to develop my own opinion of it, rather than relying on someone else's.One thing I really like about this movie is it's idea: three people doing a documentary about a legendary witch via asking locals their opinions and tales about it, (using a camcorder) then actually looking for and researching the witch in the forest where it allegedly resided.  The acting is also very convincing -the locals don't talk like they're doing a movie and the three young researchers are very convincing as well.  So in these respects, the movie succeeds.The only problem is that the acting becomes far, far, far too melodramatic and exaggerated, and by the end of the movie I was praying, ANXIOUSLY BEGGING, in fact, for the actors (the young woman and the two young men) to be ruthlessly slaughtered by this alleged witch hunting them in the most malicious, cruel fashion ever seen on film; I began to HATE and DESPISE the research team from the get-go in the forest.  Their constant slews of profanity and bickering and extreme paranoia and panic drove me up a wall and really ruined the movie in a big way.  At least I can say that they were convincing in really believing that they were being hunted and that there really was something ominous in the forest.  The ending didn't provide the deus ex machina, unfortunately (showing all three being viciously mutilated) that I badly desired, but at least it was interesting and fairly suspenseful.While The Blair Witch Project has its major flaws and shortcomings, the idea is at least, fresh and unique and it did end up being fairly suspenseful, but viewing this flic was just a little bit too aggravating with the idiotic teenage reasoning, swearing, and panicking...	3.0	Good idea, but unspectacular implementation.	2002-01-16	2	2	0
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	ATSCK1JQSPUFL	Yurik Lee	We've all become used to the modern horror flick where everything is shown on the screen. But throughout film history some of the most frightening  movies were those that held back. Jaws was very creepy until you got to see  the shark. Alien was creepy until you saw the alien and just seeing a  glimse of a ghost walk past the bedroom in 6th sense, scared the hell out  of me. This is where Blair witch works better than all the above. It shows  nothing, and lets the viewer use his/her imagination to create the monster.  If the monster was exposed at the end of the film, no amount of SFX could  have made it as scarey as what was visualized in my mind. Not seeing the  monster made it more real..It could be anything or anyone. The acting  showed a side of human behaviour that is rarely seen on film, where panic  and chaos cause people to act in weird ways. Most actors would not like to  see themselves onscreen with snot and tears running down their faces, and  that is exactly the point. These people are not meant to be actors, but  people like you or me lost in the woods and being hunted. Half way through  watching this film I tried to imagine what I would do in a similar  situation. My first reaction was to curl up in a little ball and cry. No  film has ever made me reliase that I'm probably even more pathetic than the  next person.  Lets hope Hollywood takes heed and starts making films like  they used to. You dont need big stars and budgets to make a good film, and  they don't get much better than The Blair Witch project. You just need to  kick start that imagination that has been crushed by watching years of  mindless flicks.	5.0	Use your imagination!	2000-08-29	4	2	2
6305568901	Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	Just recently, I read Stephen King's horror treatise &#34;Danse Macabre&#34;.  In that book, he discusses &#34;The Blair Witch Project&#34; as one of the most frightening movies he has ever seen.  I decided to watch it on that recommendation, and I came away fascinated by the experience.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Blair Witch&#34; focuses on a group of three friends trying to produce an independent documentary about the so-called Blair Witch that haunts the woods surrounding a rural town.  At first, the documentary seems to be going quite while, but when the trio gets lost in the woods and strange things start happening, things take a turn for the worse.Sadly, history will probably only remember this film for the controversy that surrounded it at the theater (people thinking that the documentary was actually a real thing).  While it isn't an all-time classic, to be sure, it does produce some genuine emotion by touching on some very deep themes.Basically, this movie preys on those all-too-human emotions in which the &#34;monster behind the door&#34; (as King himself describes it) is much more scary when it is unseen.  SPOILER ALERT HERE: During the entire entire, viewers never even catch so much as a glimpse of whatever/whoever is causing the strange happenings.  It's the ultimate &#34;devil you don't know&#34; story.Yet, &#34;Blair Witch&#34; also works on a more human-drama level.  Much like the later &#34;Cloverfield&#34;, it is filmed entirely in the shaky-cam style, trying to be as close to human reality as possible.  As the three hikers slowly begin to realize just how hopelessly lost they have become, parts of the film become a sort of character study in panic and emotion.  Viewers begin to wonder &#34;would I react the same way in a similar situation?&#34;Overall, I was more intrigued by &#34;Blair Witch&#34; than anything.  It is amazing to me how a movie so stark and completely devoid of any conjured drama (no soundtrack, no &#34;jump scenes&#34;, etc.) can still be a bit unsettling to watch.  I have also seen the first &#34;Paranormal Activity&#34; movie, and I don't understand why that is viewed with such reverence while &#34;Blair Witch&#34; has to fight for every inch, so to speak.  They are the same type of movie, but this effort actually shows the descent into panic/madness better than &#34;Paranormal&#34; ever did.	3.0	"A Precursor To ""Paranormal Activity"" (But Probably Even Better At What It Does)"	2014-03-04	1	1	0

Just enough expressions of creepiness and the implication of an unseen, extremely malignant, entity are given, so that  fear begans to work inside the imagination of the viewer. There are subtle  details set forth earlier in the film. If these subtle elements are missed  by the viewer, the story will not have a strong impact as it can for some.  People who rely on massive amounts of special effects or spraying blood and  gore to get their jollies from horror movies ,just won't be into this film.  This story makes me think it is a modern equivalent to the early American  stories, Young Goodman Brown or The Headless Horseman. I do think this  movie is not without problems.  The journalistic build up behind the witch  herself  could have been stronger.  I could watch this movie a second time  to catch any details I might have missed the first time around but would be  disinterested in multiple viewings. All and all I give this film a B- for  effort and a B+ for bald fear and creepy feelings.	3.0	Fear is in the unknown.	1999-12-10	10	8	2
