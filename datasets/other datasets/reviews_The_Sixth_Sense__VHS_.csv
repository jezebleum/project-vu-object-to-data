The acting is also very good especially Haley Joel Osmet.There are scenes in this film that are unforgettable and will haunt you long after you have watched it.The beginning scene with the patient in the bathroomThe little girl (now on the O.C.) whose is mysteriously illand my favorite the car ride at the end of the movie when the little boy tells his mother that he has spoken to his dead grandmother.The movie almost seems has the feeling of a Swedish or German film.  It also seems like the writer was an outsider who really captures American nuances.I cannot say enough good things about this film.  One of my favorites.  Pay attention to the plot!

I admit I got scared on many parts of the movie. And I even saw ""The Ring"" at midnight and it didn't scared as much as ""The Sixth Sense"", and I have even seen this one on the afternoon !!! It has unbelivable performances from Bruce Willis and specially from Haley Joel Osment.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	"M. Night Shymalan's 'The Sixth Sense' is one of his two best movies.  The skill by which the development and resolution of this bizarre and chilling classic make it a modern landmark.  Just by this movie alone, Night established himself as Hitchcock's successor.To describe anything more than a bare-bones rendering of the plot would be irresponsible, but here it goes... Malcolm Crow (Bruce Willis) celebrates with his wife a recent award achieved helping counsel disturbed children.  Soon he meets up with the weaknesses of his past and must suffer the consequences.  For the rest of the movie he has to make it all up with a new client, Cole (Haley Joel Osment) and balance his desire to make his wife his main priority.  The juggle isn't easy, and he falters, but is honest, in both attempts to make up mistakes for his past.  The causality of another dimension presented is disturbing, yet fascinating.The tension of the story is counterbalanced with a heart that makes more than one plot accessible and enthralling.  The performances are superb with arguably Willis' best ever.  Osment, for his part, plays a prodigy as a prodigy in what has to be one of the best (if not ""the"" best) childhood performances on film.  The supporting cast is remarkable as well.  Perhaps critics have given 'The Sixth Sense' grudging praise, for it means to unveil the supernatural in a way that is meant to mirror the real world in an unflattering way.  (Psychology is rendered at least overrated.)  Shymalan is effective like few directors are with a film that is edited for every second to wrap around the other expertly.

It more of here's a ghost  here and there!They do not even explain why they are there!Stir of echoes  has everything the sixth sense does not ! At least it has a plot while this  movie does not !

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3QR5L4SG42380	Aaron Dwight King	A lot of people whinged about thisfilm not garnering any oscars (about 150 of them, all told, in reviews), but it really didn't deserve any.  I'll gladly recognise that the little kid is way above the normal &quot;go here,  say this&quot; 2-foot parrot style of most kid actors (diff'rent strokes,  any other sitcom with kids, all Shirley Temple movies, etc., etc.), but he  wasn't the best of the year by any stretch.  It was nice of the Academy to  nominate him, will probably make him feel confident to keep acting, but his  performance was really a M. Knight-Shyamalan creation.  Any Oscar for this  movie would have to go for the screenplay, as it was one of the most clever  of the year, but when it is in competition with American Beauty, it gets  lost in the shadows.  So get over it, enjoy this extremely intelligent  piece of writing and direction with solid enough acting to carry it off,  even from the somewhat stilted Toni Colette.  The ending, by the way,  rounds out the picture nicely, even if it isn't a huge &quot;gotcha&quot;.	4.0	Solid Movie, but not an Oscar film	2000-04-17	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1VQBHHXIKHIGS	A Customer	"{My review of THE VILLAGE mentions THE SIXTH SENSE more than it does THE VILLAGE, so here it is.}I don't really want to talk a lot about this movie because I could spoil the effect. Instead, I'll talk about this filmmaker's first movie. THE SIXTH SENSE, also by M. Night Shyamalan. I first saw it in December 1999, on a 20-hour flight from Chicago to Hong Kong. My only flight out of the USA. The film really pulled me in, which I suspect is particularly difficult on an airplane.Then, the ending. Based on the article you just read, we can say that some viewers weren't surprised. Me, I was blown the heck away and wanted to see it again. Years later I finally did. I taught movie classes, this is a film I chose, and I saw it about a dozen times, fully aware of the ending. It had a bit more going for it than that.My only complaint is with people who think Bruce Willis was the star. The star is Haley Joel Osment! I may have missed out on ""the surprise ending"" because I was watching the kid instead of the shrink. Bruce Willis could probably star in a few more movies after he died and we'd never notice. But I digress.THE VILLAGE is about a pilgrim-style village. Some place quaint, rural, close knit and low tech. Nobody from the village goes into the surrounding woods lest they encounter Those We Do Not Speak Of. The acting was flawless and the scenery most certainly created a mood. Shyamalan is a masterful writer, director and producer. But I had trouble caring about what happened to his characters.That could've been my fault. Saturday morning at 8, Jan was working, and my goal for the day was to pack for our impending move but I was too drained to begin. The neighbor had loaned us this DVD back in February, so I figured watching it and returning it to him was a good start.(The same bad attitude that I brought to THE SIXTH SENSE, right? One of these days I'm going to watch a Shyamalan movie in the right frame of mind.)""The ending."" How would you like to be a filmmaker judged solely on ""the ending?"" In the case of THE VILLAGE, it worked for me. I thought about this film for days after seeing it.Actually, I was trying to decide what to write in this review. How about this?""Shyamalan is a filmmaker of bold originality surviving in a commercialized medium.""That's a good thing, no matter what your opinion of each individual film is. I believe some critics are panning him, but I'm not panning this one. I'm glad I saw it. I've missed a few films between THE SIXTH SENSE and THE VILLAGE, and there will be more after THE VILLAGE. I'll watch them all."	4.0	Shyamalan	2006-08-28	3	1	2
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1C0C9IJO2HS03	A Customer	"It seems that my gift is a lot more icky. Eww, the smell of rotting corpses. At least if you see dead people, you can close your eyes and they're ""gone.""Anyway, onto the movie. It's damn good and Bruce Willis didn't have to kill anybody. ;)  I could end my review there, but I think there's more to it than that. The Sixth Sense is one of the films of the '90s that really blew me away the first time I watched it, and with each viewing it gets better. I've seen it four times now. A child shrink, Malcolm Crowe (Willis), takes on the case of a traumatized 9-year-old boy named Cole (Osment) who can communicate with the dead. His divorced mother Lynn (Collette) is worried about her son's frequent nightmares and episodes of acting out. Director Shyamalan shows that he knows how to startle an audience and create a creepy atmosphere, and the script and actors are first-rate. The heavily-awarded Osment turns in a touching, brilliant performance as the terrified young boy, a performance of such depth that is rare for an actor of his age. I can't wait to see what he'll do as he grows and matures. (Also watch for him as Forrest Jr. in 1994's Forrest Gump.) Willis's acting is wonderful too, and it's great to see him in a subdued role like this.Definitely worth buying for the DVD extras, which tell a lot about the making of the film and other little things that make it more enjoyable to watch."	5.0	I smell dead people!	2002-07-15	4	1	3
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2EGATRZURZ53V	A customer	Don't get me wrong, I've never seen Willis act better and Michael Caine was right when he said HL Osment should have got the Oscar.  But... the script lets them down.  I can't say why without spoiling the end, but it  just doesn't hang together.I felt like the crazy lady in  &quot;Misery&quot; complaining about 1920-era matinee series - at the end  of one episode the hero goes over a cliff in a train and it blows up.  But  at the start of the next episode he manages to jump out and escape.The  movie is good while you watch it, and if you can disengage your brain at  the end you can ignore the inconsistency.  But if you can't, you may feel  disappointed.This is a good way to spend 2 hours, but rent it - don't  buy it.	3.0	Ok but not great	2000-04-25	13	4	9

Sure there are scary moments but they seem secondary to the relationship that builds between Willis and the little boy and to  some extent the boy's mother.  The story actually is quite simple and I was  expecting something a little more intricate.  That's the only reason for 1  missing star.  The acting is well done throughout.  One odd aspect of this  DVD is the previews in the beginning.  I couldn't find a way to get past  this other than fast forwarding.  That is slightly annoying.	4.0	Nicely done	2000-06-24	1	0	1

But yes it can be suspensful at some times but when the film starts to reach its climax it gets more emotional, the ending is very sad itself, it as if when your done watching the movie that it takes something away from you, and puts something back in, you will just be in your seat thinking about what you just saw, and it will affect your life, it should...

This film is not  your typical mummies walking and scaring people as they pass by, but more  of a spiritual charm that does not only entertain in a most creative way  but educate the soul of your sixth sense from the eyes of a young child.  Needless to say the cast was astonishing, the Director who is also the  writer was brilliant and the movie has perhaps the most unpredictable  ending i for one have ever seen.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2R1XIQVGC5ZA6	Alexie Kinast	Most horror movies, while I still continue to watch them, don't exactly captivate me and pull me into the story. The Sixth Sense most definately did, and I'm not just saying that to be like everybody else. Haley Joel  Osment is an excellent young actor, and Willis is in top form in this  flick. He handled an intelligent, sensitive role better than I ever thought  possible, and Haley, well... Haley is already an icon of precocious youth.  Because these actors were well-suited to their roles, the film is smooth  and progresses naturally, without feeling rushed or pushed. I also liked  the fact that Shyamalan didn't overuse the gore and ghosts aspect of the  movie, for that would've quickly desensitized me. Instead, he placed the  ghosts sparingly, at parts in the movie when they would create the most  uproar amongst the audience. James Newton Howard is also an excellent  composer and the score of Sense is haunting and lilting without being  jolting.If you haven't seen it yet, please do. There is a very definate  reason it was pegged the #1 thriller of all time, and the academy (in my  opinion) must've been out of their minds not to award this superlative  endeavor.	5.0	Who didn't love this movie?	2000-07-21	2	2	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2QGM63A8ZNSFG	"Alex Kalb ""akalb@clarku.edu"""	This was, without a doubt, an amazing movie.  The plot focuses on the once great child psychologist Malcolm Crow (Willis) and his attempts to help the disturbed child (Osment).  Osment is a real show stealer here, and his scenes with his mother are touching without being unrealistic.  The supernatural aspect of the story is much more subtle than anything recently released under the moniker of a horror movie.  Absolutely no one dies in any kind of bloody way over the course of the movie, which is truly original in this day and age.  This movie is inventive and scary and I defy anyone that says that you'd only want to watch it once. With the DVD, not only do you get this intense, brilliant movie, but you also get deleted scenes with an introduction by the director, a short but informative featurette, and an amusing little gift, an excerpt from a movie made by the director when he was only ten.	5.0	Spooky, fascinating, stacked	2001-03-18	1	1	0

The way the movie was arranged and acted out is  so detailed, I have watched it several more times and each time I discover  something I had never noticed before.  I enjoyed the deleted scenes because  after you have seen the movie itself, it is refreshing and even  entertaining to see what was left out and why.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A9Z4C6SSRUL0E	A. Liu	"Instead of raving about how good this film is, I believe people should watch it and be their own judge of its worth. However I would like to clarify some of the arguments from those people who denied The Sixth Sense in the previous reviews:(1) Unless you can identify with the little boy, you will not be 'scared' by The Sixth Sense. Because it does not 'TRY' to scare you. It is simply a supernatural DRAMA that tells a story of a little boy, and what HE sees is scary to him. Put you into his shoes - eight years old, seeing dead people walking around in the house - wouldn't that be scary if it was you? Or maybe you have been drinking so much since then that all your brain cells have been killed so you cannot remember your childhood imagination? Want to be scared till your pants drop? Want to see large amount of blood only the blood bank of the county hospital can supply? Then go back to watch your B-grade slasher flick. ""Sixth Sense"" is not for you.(2) People who claimed that they have guessed the ending from the first ten minutes because it was so 'pathetically obvious', how exactly did you do that? Simply by 'he got shot -> the next fall when he was sitting on the bench', and all the secrets revealed? It's either you are a psychic, or you are amazingly simple-minded. Or even you have seen it before and just trying to show off how clever you are. The fact is, boast about how easy it is for you to guess the ending does not make you a more intelligent audience, but more superficial. If you are so smart, why aren't you making one of the biggest box-office hit last year?(3) Some claimed that it is unreasonable for the ghosts not to know that they are dead, and spite the story to be stupid. But, how many ghosts do you know? How do you know what the ghosts know and don't know? You don't even know whether there are ghosts or not and yet you made yourself to be the representative of the nether world? This is a story that is being told like it has never been. Since you think the idea is absurd, then there is no way you would be able to tell a story like this, ever. Consequence? See (2) above. By the way, how many films DO make sense? 'Scream To The Infinity'? 'I Know What You Did On My Grandmother's Birthday Party'?(4) As for the DVD itself, there is NOTHING WRONG WITH THE DISC!! All the problem that occurs is because of your DVD player, either the setup or player function. Read your player manual before you throw all your blames onto a quality disc.(5) One reviewer said that the 'deleted scenes' are 'cut out' from the theatrical release... PLEASE!!! They are NOT. They are the scenes that never surfaced in cinema and put back by the director into the disc as an extra, he also explained why they were left out. One other said that the 'Storyboard-Film comparison' was not there, how come? They are on the top of the list of the bonus features!Despite the few negative reactions of the lesser some about this movie, I saw this film with respect and expectation toward the filmmakers' creativity and the actors performances, and damned if I did not enjoy the 100 minutes, again and again."	4.0	Making Sense	2002-12-29	4	2	2
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3JQRM0U1T8QRO	"Allan Ostermann ""allan"""	This film is the closest thing to an Exorcist for the 90's. There have been thousands of gory films over the years, but this is different. This is creepy. And well written.Haley is incredible as the horrified little boy  who can't look over his shoulder without seeing something terrifying. Bruce  is just fine as the psychologist who wants to make up for a big mistake  with an old patient he couldn't help (however he does do that manly surly  puckered cheek look he's infamous for. Otherwise he was okay).He  pursues Cole for redemption from his past. Little does he know that Cole  will help him more than he can help Cole.Toni Collette is great as  Cole's mom, a harried single woman holding two jobs and trying to reach the  distant boy. My only problem with her acting is slight; she does that  laughing-crying thing that looks awful. You know, the boo hoo hoo with the  smile. Other than that, she's incredibly real.When I mention the creep  factor, I'm reminded of the scene in The Shining with the dead twin girls  in the elevator. I can still visualize that scene in my head. This is a  film full of that kind of yikes factor.As for the girl who vomits (I  won't say anything more), that scenario is taken directly from Hitchcock's  incredible Notorious, but put to good use.There is one other scene that  sticks with me because I laughed and didn't know if it was supposed to be  funny. It was certainly macabre. It involves the boy who says, &quot;Let's  go check out my dad's gun collection.&quot;As for the ending, here it  is. Bruce Willis is actually a man. Wait, no. That's The Crying Game.See  this film, then see it again to see how seamlessly the makers avoided any  inconsistencies.	5.0	And I don't like Bruce Willis...	2000-05-06	0	0	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1TD9JUXG1DGW3	"Allie Kat ""sarahphin"""	This is a classic ghost story. It's subtle, evenly-paced, and takes its time to develop the characters. It's not a typical formula story. I'm very, very glad that I saw it when it first came out, and was able to be swept along in the story. Watching it again, I got more of the detail and was no less entranced. The performances were terrific. I'm always leery of anything with a child in it but of course Haley Joel Osment is a separate breed from sitcom monsters. Bruce Willis does an excellent and sensitive job portraying the child psychologist. Regrettably I think some viewers were expecting the usual action/adventure fare and were disappointed that it was not, and were unable to accept that he is a fine actor who has done a wide range of roles. Similarly, those who were expecting a horror movie with screaming teenaged girls must have been disappointed. The cinematography, the direction, are wonderful. This is entertainment for the brain and I can only wonder why, with all the talent that's available, such movies are so rare.	5.0	Classic Ghost and Suspense Story	2000-10-18	5	4	1

Although the reviewers I heard didn't mention the exact nature of it I figured it out after a few minutes of the film.  I think I might have enjoyed this movie more had I not known, but I will say that even the second time I watched it, it was still entertaining.This kind of movie has to be really good to be enjoyable the second viewing, so I will say it's a good movie.  The child actor had to be good and they picked a winner here.  Willis is better and more entertaining in action flicks (at least that is my opinion) but here and in the movie The Kid, he is good, there is no doubt.If you haven't somehow overheard the twist in this movie, hurry and watch it before someone ruins it for you.  This is the kind of scary movie that can be watched with older kids as it is very scary at points, and while it has some gruesome scenes in it, it doesn't have outright gory violence like a slasher flick nor does it have any sex scenes.  A strong recommendation for anyone that likes good drama and doesn't mind a couple of frightening images.	4.0	Scary and well written	2002-02-25	0	0	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3D2TTJBCKPBF0	Amazon Lover	It is superb.  Willis seems to be taking a professional turn away from the mindless action genre that he is so well entrenched in, embracing instead the dramatic  roles that he is so capable of commanding.  &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is  one of his best films to date.  As Roger Ebert noted in his review of the  film, Willis succeeds in doing what many actors would find difficult to  accomplish; acting opposite a young boy while making it SEEM like acting.  It is difficult to avoid the temptation of coaching dramatic responses out  of such a young thespian, let alone to maintain a strictly professional  attitude while performing opposite such a young child.  Willis makes his  role opposite the boy credible.  More than a mere nod must also be granted,  however, to the accomplishments of young Osment in this film; he required  no coaching from Willis!  The story depends almost entirely upon the  credibility of the young actor's role as a boy haunted by visions of the  dead.  And the role is executed flawlessly.  Osment's Oscar nomination is  richly deserved.&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is one of those rare  cinematic experiences which demand more than one viewing.  As almost every  other reviewer has noted, the ending of the film is a giant suprise, even  for those who prepare themselves to observe the entire story acutely.  Overall, a superbly acted and directed picture, well worth the time and  money it costs to view it.  More than once, that is!	5.0	Reviewers take care in what you write!

It passes over the blood and guts thriller style  of 'scary movies' and is instead a deeply dramatic psychological thriller  that gives the viewer a most unsettled feeling.  Willis delivers one of his  best performances to date.  The supporting cast is fantastic and of course,  Osmet simply amazed me.  This young actor portrayed Cole Sear with depth  and range far beyond his years and experience.  The basic story premise may  not be the most original or complex but it is handled with superb skil,  creating an emotional tour de force film.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	"The greatest thing about `The Sixth Sense' is that to this date it has yet to be topped, not even by its director.  Film and film and film again and yet nothing comes close to that bone-chilling feeling one gets every time they hear those four famous words uttered...""I see dead people.""M. Night Shyamalan made a household name for himself no matter how difficult the pronunciation with this `Grade-A' supernatural thriller about a young boy troubled by his unique gift.  The film opens with a tragic event involving Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who has just received an award in his honor.  But before the celebrations can truly begin he's confronted by an ex-patient of his who it seems Crowe was never able to help.  The aftershocks of that evening ring throughout the remainder of the film as Crowe's relationship with his wife becomes more and more strained.  But as that relationship slowly dies he forms a bond with his new patient Cole Sear.  Cole has a problem that is presents itself almost too familiar with Crowe.  It appears that Cole can communicate with the dead.Both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment are outstanding in this brilliant film.  Some have claimed Willis to be too reserved and reclusive and thus leaving the entire film on the shoulders of the very capable Osment, but in my eyes both of these actors contribute exactly what they needed in order to make this film work.  Willis wears the confusion of his situation on his face with earnest honesty and that adds layers to his character.  Osment shines so brightly here and should have walked away with the Oscar that night, but alas, he'll have his day again I'm sure.  He gives Cole so much charm and charisma.  He's able to create a believable nine-year-old boy without playing the complexity of his character down at all.  He adds so much believable maturity.  It's truly astounding to watch.The star of this film though is Shyamalan who instills a deep-rooted fear into the audience from the very beginning.  It's this very asset that sets `The Sixth Sense' apart from all the Hollywood cheap imitations that seemed to swarm the theaters shortly after `The Sixth Sense' made a killing and set the bar.  Sure, there are a few that followed that were worth the price of admission (the Nicole Kidman vehicle `The Others' was one of them), but for the most part nothing since has even touched the surface of the effortless brilliance that was and is `The Sixth Sense'.  The lighting, the music, the atmosphere, set designs, script and acting all add so much originality and suspense to this one of a kind experience.There's hardly a fault to be found with this multi-Academy Award nominated film.  The entire cast (I should make mention of the amazing Toni Collette who is just fascinating as Cole's frustrated mother) delivers down to the bone and makes this a film to watch again and again and again."	5.0	Dark and disturbing and sincerely one of the very best...	2007-07-27	2	1	1
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2MCVEY373U28W	Andrew Essary	I could go on and on about this movie, but &quot;wow&quot; says it all. I could mention the incredible performances. Haley Joel Osment delivered a knock-out punch to audiences. He was amazing, his fear seeming genuine, from the perfect delivery of his dialogue to the subtle facial movements that sold the scene. Perhaps the only thing more surprising than the kid's performance was his being robbed of the Oscar he so richly deserved. Bruce Willis broke his steretypical one-line warrior role and made us believe that he could be more than a tough guy, like say, a sensitive and intelligent psychiatrist. Toni Collette showed us just how amazing her voice-talent is and how real her emotions can be as the mother of the frightened boy. Olivia Williams was convincing as Dr. Crowe's wife, wether she was being playful, loving, scared, or cold.  I could mention the writing and the directing. M. Night Shyamalan proved just how great he can be with his first true success. From the scene set-ups to the incredible camera angles, his on-screen vision is without parallel in the suspense genre.  I could mention the extra features. From friendly interviews to deleted scenes, and a bonus little snippet from his childhood, the features are both interesting and exciting.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A30EWR3PT5XOWG	Andrew Kravetz	NO SPOILERS HEREThe Sixth Sense is a solid entertaining film. It is a must for my DVD collection (and yours). We start with the casting. Bruce Willis has proven himself as a serious character actor (He's not all  Diehard and Blind Date). Haley Joel Osmond proves that he is worthy of  Adult-sized respect in Hollywood. (He alone made me see it a third time in  theaters). Even the supporting cast, like the boy's mother and teacher have  strong performances, although I can't remember their names.  This film  [without spoilers] has apparently set the Standard for which other  thrillers are to be judged. Any movies that come out in 2000 will  undoubtedly be compared to this gem. None will live up to its subtle way of  grabbing you and then shocking you. The Ending alone was enough to make me  see it a second time.  Trust me. There are a lot of mediocre films with  big hype. This film earned its hype through audience and critical response  alone. This is the one to own.	4.0	Solid Entertainment	2000-03-13	2	1	1

The acting is superb throughout and the  production is excellent.So why only one star, well, I couldn't give it  zero... the idiots that made the DVD seemed to think that every time you  use the disc, you want to watch 4 other movie trailers. Using the features  of DVD they have disabled all the buttons until you have watched the  trailers - this is possibly the most irritating thing they could have done.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	ANDZZ303EP3KX	Andy P.	First of all, beware, there may be spoilers in theis text. I just want to  point out a few things that may inspire people who were totally surprised  in the end (I wasn't) to see the film again.If you are yet too see the  movie you probably know some big development will be revealed in the last  minute and if you can find clues and have a good guess by the end you will  be more satisfied. Otherwise you may feel as if they just threw something  on at the end (Which is not at all true - there are so many clues, long  before the end I thought the twist was obvious) Just don't let yourself be  fooled.Here's where some of you should leave.I cannot believe how  many people were fooled by this movie, were told they were fooled and still  don't know it. Does anyone else realize the signifigance of the penny trick  Malcolm shows the boy. It might have been unintentional but I think it's  symbolic of how the jump between scene one and two is supposed to trick  you. First Malcolm is shot in the chest (heart area) and possibly before  you can think how he could survive the wound you see him walking around  again. The eye is quicker than the mind (or is it the other way around).  But in the film, the penny trick never works and possibly the filmmakers  didn't intend this trick to work either. (For me, the drick didn't work,  just like the penny trick, and I ended up loving the movie, every second  was good as it happened was thrilling and I could think and find clues as I  was watching) Maybe the movie would have been better if those two scenes (1  and 2) had not tricked as many people as they did.The film is also great  because of the nightmarish quality the film takes. The settings were pretty  drab (opulent possibly) The set is nothing memorable or nothing that  outshines the two characters, which adds to the nightmare. How many people  find signifigant the details of the location of their dreams/nightmares.This is really a well written, almost flawless, wholly entertaining,  creepy, almost completely horrifying and not too long movie. Anyone not at  all scared obviously would have no problem with unfamiliar bodies wandering  their house.	5.0	They tricked you!!	2000-04-04	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1FE06N5A77K8W	Annie Feng	I watched parts of The Sixth Sense in English class, I thought it was interesting and went to rent it. While I was at the movie rental place, I searched in Action, Comedy and Sci/Fantasy for this movie, but couldn't find it, then a helper found it in the Horror section, and I was amazed The Sixth Sense was counted for a horror movie. When I brought the movie home to watch it, I guess it has its scary moments, but overall it's NOT a scary movie, I mean, how can it be counted as a scary movie when the message of the movie is NOT meant to scare you: Ghosts can be just as lost as anybody and sometimes need help, so you shouldn't be afraid of them. Tell you the truth, I am a very easily scared person, *Seriously I am*, I have been avoiding horror movies ever since I was seven because I watched this movie which I thought of now is kinda ridiculous but it scared the crap outta me, but The Sixth Sense did not scare me at all, I don't even think it should be qualified as a scary movie, it's pretty much in the same category as those ghost-inserted action movie but without the action.But the movie itself I thought was well done, and Haley Joel Osman is my favorite young actor, he's fantastic!	4.0	Not really scary at all	2005-07-08	6	4	2
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AK6UVFSU07NXH	Anthony Hinde	It must be difficult to cast films where the central character is a young child, particularly when the role is so emotionally demanding. In the case of The Sixth Sense, Avy Kaufman either got very lucky or made an inspired  choice by casting Haley Joel Osment. He plays Cole Sear and owns the screen  for the large majority of the show.Cole is tormented but it isn't  until about half way through the film that we find out it is because he can  see the dead. And to an eight-year-old, being visited by disturbed, maimed  and angry spirits is horrifying. It's made all the worse because he has no  one he can turn to for support. He is the only one who can see ghosts and  his behavior has made him a freak in the eyes of his classmates and  teacher.The film starts with a frightening glimpse of what Cole  may become. Renowned child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe has a grim reunion  with a former patient. An unstable child of yesteryear, Vincent Gray, has  grown into a fractured and psychotic adult who wants nothing more than to  remind Malcolm of his failure, before killing himself. The reminder takes  the form of a bullet in his doctor's stomach.We catch up with the  good doctor, played superbly by Bruce Willis, about a year later. (This  role is not unlike that Willis had in The Color of Night, although in this  case his character is a gentler soul.) Malcolm is reviewing his case notes  on young Cole, prior to their introduction. We learn that Cole's profile is  identical to Vincent's, Malcolm's patient from years earlier. The big clue  for the audience is that Vincent and Cole both have a small spot of blond  hair within their otherwise dark locks.The film builds slowly,  which is not to imply that it is dull. In fact a better description would  be &quot;mesmerizing&quot;. We are forced to care for  young Cole as a  clearer picture is painted of his day to day existence. No night is safe  for him, no place is free of fear and no one understands his torment. In a  desperate bid for sanctuary he turns to the church and the questionable  protection of religious symbols, which he shamelessly steals, building a  chapel in his bedroom.His local church is where Cole and Malcolm  first meet, after a strange solo dash down the street. And so begins the  careful building of a relationship, a friendship, and eventually a  salvation for both of them. For Cole is not the only one with problems. Dr  Crowe is also a changed man. The dramatic shooting and suicide of his  patient has shaken Malcolm's faith. He is no longer a satisfied purveyor of  mental balms but a frightened, uncertain victim. His wife Anna, seems  unable or unwilling to deal with the situation; and what had been a close  and loving relationship is now teetering on the brink of collapse.It is not long before we realize that Malcolm is Cole's only hope for  sanity and conversely, Cole may be Malcolm's last chance for redemption.  With a foundation like that, I was looking forward to the meat of the  story. Cole does eventually come to trust in Malcolm but we already know  that trust is not a cure in itself. Vincent was a potent lesson of this. So  when Cole reveals his secret, it is simply a gauntlet thrown down to  Malcolm. Cole claims to be able to see the dead. A classic case of  schizophrenic delusions but unusual in one so young.Up to this  point in the film we have seen nothing of a supernatural nature, only the  sad effects that Cole exhibits. And so Malcolm's diagnosis is  understandable. Once the secret is out however, our viewpoint is released  and we are able to see as Cole does. His world is populated by terrifying  beings that seem ignorant of their own maimed appearance and, in Cole's  words, only see what they choose to see and have no understanding of their  own death. His midnight callers create some of the scariest cinema I've  seen in years. Not because of cutting edge special effects but because we  share Cole's helplessness in the face of his &quot;gift&quot;. Even his  homemade church offers no protection and he is driven past despair.I can't go any further into the story without running the risk of  spoiling the final plot twist. Instead, I will simply beg you to see this  gripping, intelligent and deeply emotional movie. Let's put some more money  in the pockets of director M. Night Shyamalan in the hopes that he will  continue to make movies of this caliber.	5.0	You know that feeling you get on the back of your neck?	2000-05-11	6	4	2

This could have been an outstanding movie, but alas, too many plot-holes, and too many unanswered questions.  Not the good kind of unanswered--the kind of unanswered that shows that the creators of the movie couldn't think in a straight line.Why did Cole know Latin?  Why did he know his teacher used to stutter?  Why did Malcolm never wonder why he doesn't eat, shower, or sleep?  Why would Cole's mother's grandmother leave the bumblebee pendant in Cole's bureau drawer?  Where's the sense in that?  Why did the dead people, hung by their necks, NOT KNOW THEY WERE DEAD?!  And all three of them?  What a co-ink-ee-dink!And Malcom's wife could NOT talk to him in her sleep.  You cannot speak or hear when you're in the deepest stage of sleep, and if she had been in a stage light enough to hear Malcolm and speak to him, she would have startled awake from the freezing cold, his voice, or from hearing herself speak aloud.&quot;Clues&quot; could have been handled more delicately.  It's just silly to have &quot;insight&quot; presented to us through Malcolm's flamboyant circling of script in his textbooks.I really liked how the two noxious kids who locked Cole in the closet didn't even get questioned or scolded for either a) locking him in there or b) standing there stupidly while he screamed and spazzed out.Also, this flick just wasn't that scary.  I jumped once, and that's because I had the volume too darned loud.  I'd expected a real spine-tingler.Too much sentimental stuff.  Resonance is good in a movie--Cole going on about great-grandma seeing his mother's recital is not.This movie had some strong points, but the weak points kept nagging at me throughout the entire film.  I had expected near-perfection considering the hype this movie got AND the Oscar nominations, to boot. :(However, it is kind of spooky to imagine that the reason we feel fear when we're alone is that there really ARE ghosts lurking in our midst.  But then again, isn't hocus-pocus superstition what usually prompts fear in the first place?  So I guess that speculation isn't too ingenious......On an up note, I CAN skip over the previews with my Playstation 2.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1BJU6WP3VJ4JG	"April Stuart ""alynns"""	This review pertains particularly to the DVD version of this film because even though I'd seen 'Sixth Sense' twice at the cinema, the DVD purchase was still worth it because of its great extras. I particularly loved the  'Rules and Clues' segment which explained how the famous twist had to be  believable for both the first and second viewings. Some were obvious but  some were pretty obscure and admittedly, maybe I'm a little dim, but I  think the editors gave their viewers a little too much credit in the  fine-detail detective work! We didn't know we had any reason to be looking  for clues! Fascinating stuff anyway.The 'deleted scenes' were also great  to see and quite considerable in content. You kind of agree with the  reasons for the deletions but understand the angst at having to remove such  great scenes. The DVD is worth it just to see those extra moments between  Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis.And how ever many times it's been  said, I have to add to the tributes to Haley Joel Osment and say that his  portrayal of Cole was flawless. You felt the weight of the world on his  shoulders and the ending was as much as a salvation for the the viewer as  it was for him. Haley has a distinguished career ahead of him, if this film  is any reflection of his future.	5.0	The best twist ever!	2000-07-22	0	0	0

I agree with the other viewers who are disgusted with the DVD version containing (what is considered to be VHS material)soon to be outdated movie pre-views . What  was the studio or distributor and marketing execs thinking by featuring  Mission to Mars and other previews on a Collector's Edition DVD; Obviously  they weren't. Imagine seeing your DVD copy of The Sixth Sense 5-10 years  from now and thinking how nostalgic and dated it will look and feel seeing  that blasphemous Mission to Mars preview with its theatrical date release  glaring at you !As for The Sixth Sense, without a shadow of a doubt, it  definitely deserves to be placed high on a mantle or pedestal next to  1999's Academy favorite and winner American Beauty !I also would've  enjoyed seeing Haley Joel Osment win for Best Supporting Actor. So what if  the kid is only a kid.Many film critics were astonished by his performance  yet said that for a child to receive the Oscar at that age would be too  soon for his career ! Hogwash.In this day and age nothing is &quot;too  soon&quot; for anybody's career--especially an award for a child of this  acting caliber. He acts with more genuine feeling and emotion than most  so-called professional adult actors out there in today's film industry (  shocking that some of these actors are still in the business despite their  lack of acting skills).Bruce Willis gave one of his more finer  performances in quite awhile. I can see why he was chosen to play Malcolm.  They say those with a comedic or witty and sarcastic exterior are the ones  who are more apt to show greater and deeper emotions of a serious sensitive  nature.Bruce showed that there ain't nothing wrong with a man showing his  more tender and emotional side without having to make a wisecrack to cover  up for some sort of insecurity complex! You go Bruce...As for the  performances by Wahlberg and Collette, simply OUTSTANDING ! Could not  believe that Wahlberg lost about 40 lbs. for the role; talk about an actor  literally throwing himself into the role (method actor ?).  As for Toni  Collette, I did not know she is originally from Australia and was in  Muriel's Wedding.She was able to swap her Aussie accent for a New Jersey  one; fascinating !The story, plot, effects, were equally mesmerizing.

Does this sound interesting? Well, yes, it is. The question here is: is the movie  interesting? I'll leave that to you to find out, but all that I can say is  that this movie is overhyped and filled with holes. And please, don't say  to me that I don't have the imagination to find out the answers by myself,  it is because I have a very good imagination that I say this movie is  filled with holes.  Just look at the ending. If you keep  with the  storyline, you'll deduct that certain events, that don't appear in the  movie, should take place at a certain point in time (point in time that you  need to imagine) for the scenes that appear on the movie to be there.  Right? Then, following the same logic, you'll rule out the ending. It  simply wasn't well planned, that's all.

Generally speaking I don't care for Bruce Willis' films, but recently he seems to be remaking his image into a more caring, gentle persona.  This film appears to be one  of those efforts and is overwhelmingly successful.  Young Osment is a joy  to watch.  Quite evidently a precocious child when seen interviewed on  Opera and other talk shows, he is a consumate actor and puts his character  across well.  The plot of the film is tightly woven, with the ending so  thoroughly unsuspected and delightful, that I actually went to go through  it again to see if there was any evidence for &quot;cheating&quot; or  goofs; there weren't.  The special effects are used with restraint and only  when integral to the plot, furthering a prescribed goal rather than used to  make up for difficiencies as they are often used in other films.

To pull this off was a nightmare of timing, camera angles and great acting I'm sure.  Bruce Willis  has a marvelous chameleon quality that makes him believeable in this role.  I'm an admirer of his in his over the top action roles as well.  It is a  credit to his talent that he can do both. The young boy does a wonderful  job as the child that sees &quot;Dead people&quot;.  The roles are  developed well and keep you in a net till the end.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3568NFZQJL313	A. Tomsho	This is my taste in horror movies.  Some people go for the gore-fests, some go for films that are just shocking and disturbing.  Nothing wrong with that.  I myself just prefer something with a little more depth to it than most of the films in that category.The Sixth Sense, from writer/director M. Night Shyamalan, is fully satisfactory.  This is possibly Bruce Willis' best role to date.  The movie itself will probably remain one of my favorites for years to come.Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Willis) is a child psychologist.  It goes badly one night when one of his former patients now grown up takes a gun to the doctor in his own home, claiming that Crowe never helped him.  Fast-forward several months, to see Crowe trying to help young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who is affected by the same symptoms as the patient who shot Malcolm before committing suicide.Malcolm is determined to try and save Cole from himself, but learns that Cole is the unwilling bearer of a strange and macabre gift: the ability to see and communicate with the dead.  At first, Crowe is unwilling to believe it, but as the film progresses, he begins to believe Cole and helps him to overcome his fear of the ghosts, instead speaking with them to try and bring them to a resolution that allows them to move on to the next life.  In other words, Cole is given the duty, the destiny, of putting restless spirits at ease.The eventual twist ending was quite a shocker, though many of you have probably already heard it from friends yammering about how either they never saw it coming, or lying and said they knew it the whole time.  These twist endings are sort of a trademark for Shyamalan, as are his directing techniques.One thing I particularly liked about his style, was his usage of symbolism and atmosphere.  Throughout the film, doors and windows always symbolize something significant.  It isn't until you see the whole film that you understand this, though.  Another subtlety in the film is the usage of the color red.  All of the other colors seem muted, but red stands out.  And it's so well-executed, you don't even realize it unless you're actively looking for it.In addition to the creepy psychological facets of the film, there were also a few shocking moments carefully placed throughout to create a greater sense of tension and dread.  There were also a couple disturbing aspects touched upon to give the film a heavier atmosphere.  These moments are made all the more disturbing by the fact that some of the acts people commit in the film are based on real mental illnesses.Overall, I give The Sixth Sense 5 stars.  Bruce Willis turns in a much better performance than some of his other recent works, Haley Joel Osment is refreshing in his incredible talent for someone his age, and Shyamalan provides a compelling story with memorable characters and some of the finest, most innovative directing approaches I've seen in a while.This is all, of course, just one man's opinion.  I'm not going to tell you that you will or will not like it, but if you enjoy the sort of stuff I've described above, it's at least worth giving a shot, right?	5.0	A Classic Example of Horror Cinema	2003-10-03	3	2	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3FMHCGIJSWIJN	"""backstreetboyfan"""	'The Sixth Sense' is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen. People who don't understand this movie either (a) don't pay close attention to what's happening in this movie; (b) just don't know much about the sixth  sense; or (c) don't believe in the sixth sense.The 'sixth sense', for  those who have no clue on what it is, is a &quot;special power&quot; that  some people (very few, however) can have. They claim to be able to see  ghosts and spirits and be able to talk to them and the ghosts and spirits  can talk back to them and see them - kind of like being a median.Anyway,  this movie is about a little boy name Cole and a child phychiatrist named  Malcolm. In the beginning, Malcolm and his wife meet one of Malcolm's old  patients. That patient tells Malcolm that Malcolm hadn't helped him solve  his problems, that it just made his problems worse. So Malcolm's patient  ended up shooting Malcolm with a gun and then killed himself. A year later,  Malcolm's new patient is 9-year-old Cole Sears who has the sixth sense.  He's afraid of the ghosts and spirits who &quot;haunt&quot; him - that's  his secret that he shares with Malcolm. Cole hides out in a church for  sanctuary reasons because of the ghosts. When Malcolm finds out Cole's  secret, he tries to help Cole get rid of the ghosts and make them leave him  alone.'The Sixth Sense' is a really good thriller starring Bruce Willis  and Haley Joel Osment with a really surprising ending! The acting is  spectacular, and Haley Joel Osment shines in this movie (it's a real shame  he didn't win that Oscar for 'Best Supporting Actor' - he really deserved  it)! The plot of this movie is brilliant, and seemed very real, like it  could really happen to someone. If you want to see a really good thriller  movie then see 'The Sixth Sense' - you'll enjoy it!	5.0	Awsome thriller movie.	2000-06-26	0	0	0

Now picture yourself in the living room of this child's home, sitting directly across the room from his mother. Would you, ...oh, I don't know, maybe, ASK THE MOTHER SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HER CHILD!Apparently, in the universe that Mr. M. Night Shyamalayan (what a spooky name, huh?) comes from, this concept is far too bizarre to comprehend. Here on the planet Earth, we human beings tend to communicate with people we are in close contact with. I guess an entire movie of ridiculous plot holes is necessary to fool rational people with a big ending. I've only seen one movie in my entire life that is more insulting to my intelligence than this piece of garbage, and that is ""The Game"". If you liked the way that the ridiculous plot holes in this movie tricked you, then you'll love ""The Game"" too.The worst thing about movies like this is that any great acting or superb visuals are ruined for me. ""The Sixth Sense"" definitely has both of these qualities, but in my opinion they are completely ruined by the impossible plot. It's a shame that you don't know how truly BAD this movie is, until it is over. I know that doesn't seem possible, but that's how this movie works. I'll never figure some things out. Do yourself a favor, and don't try to figure this movie out either. Just stare like a good little zombie at your TV, and be amazed by the ending.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A138QB80V9V046	B. Allen	Let's get one thing straight; this is NOT a horror film (chic's or otherwise) as some reviewers have characterized it.In the end, when you cook this one long enough, what is left in the bottom of the pan is the struggle of one little boy (played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment) to somehow come to grips with an ability (more a curse than a gift, or power) that is all too frightening, not only in it's  shock value, but also in it's shear pervasiveness. The threat isn't that he  sees ghosts, or even that they mean him any actual harm (thus removing it  entirely from the contemporary horror film genre in which an ever increasing body count typically leads us to a sad and predictable (anti) climax; leaving only the  protagonist standing and able to dispatch the villain, who invariably returns in the sequel). No the threat here to young Cole is that the ever  increasing throngs of uneasy spirits will completely obliterate his rather  tenuous connection to this realm of existence, and they will leave him  utterly lost, and unable to see (or hear) anything OTHER than dead people.  They don't want his blood, they want his attention. Look past their anger  and grotesque appearance and you see sad, pathetic, needful things. Wanting  nothing so much as an explanation for their current condition, and perhaps  some justice as well.Poor Cole; he just wants to be like the other kids. He just wants a friend. Someone that he can talk to. He just wants to be able to go to the bathroom in peace... It is his isolation, even from  his confused, and worried mother (wonderfully played by Toni Colette), that is taking the biggest toll, and is the heaviest load, on his narrow  shoulders.In the end we come to understand that the doctor (portrayed with an uncommon and perfectly understated sensitivity by Bruce Willis) who is so  intent on helping Cole (and redeeming himself in the process) is truly the  only one with the unique qualifications necessary to rescue him. When the  twist comes at the end we don't see it coming, not because we are looking  in the wrong place, but rather because we are not looking for it at all. It  is the loss of love that we are mourning. And in the end Love is the  redemption that we are hoping for...If you are waiting for chainsaws, or hockey masks you are looking in the wrong place. But if you are looking  for a superbly acted, and directed psychological thriller that will keep you up at night, and thinking about it for days after you've seen it, then you have  definitely come to the right place...Hitchcock is somewhere smiling happily.  He would have gotten a kick out of this one...	5.0	A great psychological thriller (and yes, a love story...)	2000-05-02	0	0	0

Seeing a second time lets you realize that no one was really talking or could see Bruce Willis.  The use of the color red was intersting and the  music....totally riviting.  Like the musical scores that made movies like  the Mask of Zorro, Crimson Tide, Independece Day, Braveheart, Air Force One  awsome, the same goes for the score on Sixth Sense.  As you watch the  movie, listen to the music!  Listen closely and you will hear breaths.  As  for the extended ending, it was nothing special, so don't go thinking that  perhaps Bruce Willis becomes re-incarnated or something.  Deleted scenes  are ok to watch, but nothing to get all excited for.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	ANGH6401L9Y0T	"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93"""	The director is M. Night Shyamalan, and I've seen a few other of his pictures, and now I think I'm going to have to check out what else he has done. He's got a way with supernatural themes that makes them seem downright natural. It's an art, that is.Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a child psychologist who has just received an award from the Mayor of Philadelphia (Shyamalan lives in the wealthy Main Line near Philadelphia) for his work with troubled children. But one of his former patients shows up in his apartment accusing him of failing him. He shoots Dr. Crowe and then himself.Later, Dr. Crowe is still trying to make sense of how he failed that patient, and starts treating young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment, one of my favorite child actors) for a condition very similar to the one that shot him and then himself. After several rather bizarre situations, Cole eventually tells Dr. Crowe his secret: he sees dead people. Dr. Crowe suggests that perhaps the reason is they want him to do something for them.You'll probably see the ending coming a mile away. I did because someone had done a spoiler on it for me. But that does not reduce the value of the movie one whit. And while is it a thriller and there are some scary, bloody parts, they are not really gross. Well, I guess the little girl who vomits as profusely as Linda Blair ever did is pretty gross, but it's only because I'm a real wimp about horror movies.This one is worth seeing.

The performances are very good, but maybe not exceptional.  But here's the thing:  This is an  extremely entertaining film.  The quality of the DVD is excellent.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1LO05OQR2UAG2	"""baronnine"""	Overhyped, yes, and severely overrated in general.  This movie was just plain horrible.  It's an incohesive film, with a plot that pushes one's suspension of disbelief to such an extent and is so full of holes it's  almost a parody.  There are incomprehensibly also a LOT of tears in this  movie; it seems almost every scene involves some kind of inane variation on  someone crying.  Most of all, it was just plain boring and dumb.  Throw in  one of THE most annoying child actors you'll ever see, and you have the  recipe for a pure waste of a couple of hours of your life.  I watched this  film with friends, and the only reason we lasted past the first half-hour  to begin with was to see the much-vaunted ending.  Needless to say, it left  us as empty as the rest of the film.  It's too late for us; our two hours  are lost forever.  A chunk of time we'll never see again.  But it's not too  late for you.  If my review can save just one person from wasting that same  chunk of their precious life (not to mention the synapses they'd burn out  by sitting through this moronic mess), then my sacrifice will at least not  have been in vain.  Stay away from this garbage...your five senses will  thank you.	1.0	Ugh...awful	2000-01-23	184	18	166
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ	"Barry ""Barrybgb"""	M. Night Shyamalan accomplished something really great with this frightening chiller. He created a scary horror film that was just that. Scary. No over the top effects, no gratuitous gore with no reason for being there, and so on. It's an old fashioned ghost story meant to give you the chills. Probably a few willies here and there too. Bruce Willis stars as child Psychologist Malcolm Crowe. He's helping a 9 year old boy named Cole Sear(brilliantly played by Haley Joel Osment)who seems to have the gift of seeing ghostly visions. Of actually seeing and hearing spirits. The case is especially significant to Dr. Crowe. A patient of his had broken into the doctor's house a few months earlier and shot him. The guy then turned the gun on himself and pulled the trigger. He definitley doesn't want another patient to turn out like that. His marriage to his wife(played by Olivia Williams), hasn't been the same since. Shyamalan knows how to set the mood. There are dark colors, ghostly effects, and just some moody looking shots. Very eerie. Shyamaln has crafted the film together so brilliantly. It's clever and imaginative. I guarantee that you will be watching the film a few more times afterwards to piece everything all together. Bruce Willis is really good. He's not just the &quot;Die Hard&quot; guy. He's a real actor, and a good one at that too. Then there's young Osment. He delivers a shockingly magnificent portrayal as Cole. Never have I seen such a mesmerizing performance from a young actor in all my life. He was nominated for the Oscar and he deserved it. He really could have won. Toni Collette, as his mother, was fabulous as well. Shyamalan is a creative and imaginative director/writer. He really is a talent to watch. He followed this up with the darker &quot;Unbreakable&quot;. It wasn't as good, but very interesting nonetheless. The Sixth Sense is a classic film that will live on for ages.	4.0	&quot;I See A Classic!....&quot;	2001-12-26	4	2	2
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3NBHD2FW44TAM	Batman	Previews for this movie showed it off as just another stupid horror movie, which today are very common. This movie is not that way at all. Its very scary, and dramatic. The film tells the story of Cole Sear(wonderfully played by Haley Joel Osment) who is very troubled. Malcolm Crowe(Willis) a child psychiatrist helps little Cole with his problems. But he later finds out from him that he sees dead people, walking around like normal peole not knowing they're dead. Easily a classic. We get chilling scares, and a few tears as well. Earned 6 Academy Award nominations which I thought it should have won. Shyamalan is a great director! I reccomend his newest thriller Unbreakable! The dvd has lots of great features that talk about the movie and what they did with it, and also some deleted scenes. I highly reccomend this on dvd! High points:the direction, the superb acting, the scares and the drama mixed together, the surprise ending, the hauting score, and what ever else I missed. Low points:None.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2582KMXLK2P06	B. E Jackson	"It was always a complete mystery to me what people saw in this movie.  Why it caught on in terms of popularity across the United States back in the late 90's is totally beyond me.  When I first watched this movie, the first thing that went through my mind was ""Oh no, this movie is going to kill the horror genre"".  Luckily not every single horror movie ripped off the ideas of this film to make the entire genre worthless (unlike say, Van Halen, whose influence made listening to guitar solos in a rock song a chore from that point on, but that's a different subject for a different time).I was never *ever* scared while watching the Sixth Sense.  Not even once.  Nothing even came close to giving me goosebumps.  Everything came across so ordinary, almost like a dream from a childs point of view.  No, not a nightmare- just a regular dream.  I was completely unsatisfied with the acting as well.  The little boy from Thunder Alley was the worst possible choice- he wasn't convincing at all.  I didn't feel his emotions (which were overbearingly exaggerated most of the time).  The whole ""I see dead people"" thing was about the dumbest thing I've ever seen.  Watching him walk around and say things like ""There's a dead guy over there"" didn't have me convinced a dead spirit was around him at all.  Guess what everyone?  There's a dead guy standing next to me while I type this review for amazon.  I'm scared, shaking and very nervous right now.  Are you scared?  Of course not.Going to high school when this movie came out, I can't believe so many of my classmates were scared of this story and actually went around saying the new hot expression ""I see dead people"".  How horrible.  Then again, maybe they were making fun of it.  I hope so.I have nothing good to say about the Sixth Sense.

It was obvious to me even in the trailers.  The movie was  excellent in that it remained true to the old thriller noir films such as  the abiance Hitchcock loved. But the honest truth if it hadn't been for the  stunning performance of Haley Joel Osment as Cole... this film would not  have shined. The dread you feel is for that little boy and his horrible  secret of seeing dead people.  The real thrill is watching a little scap of  a boy tortured with his big eyes and quivering lips as your heart wrenches  for him and his mother.  Overall, the film was not what I expected, but  Haley Joel Osment amazed and astounded me with a believable Cole.	3.0	Hardly What I Expected	2000-04-04	1	1	0

Some of it is eerie and unbelieveable, other parts so beautiful with the scenery and people.  Bruce Willis was certainly handsome, just like in THE KID.  He works well with children.The thing I had trouble understanding when I viewed this film at the theater was his being able to interact with the child if he were dead.  I kept wanting him to be alive and well.  Apparently, the little boy was the only person to be able to see and talk with him.The strange things which continued to happen to the psychic kid were unusual to say the least.  His acting was not juvenile but more on the adult level.  He is a good little trouper.Dealing with the psychiatric deviants as this character had done in his professional life turned out to be dangerous and deadly.  The director seems to delve into the inner workings of the minds of non-average misfits, and turns out a suspenseful and powerful story with a message.	4.0	Is there life after death?	2004-04-26	3	1	2
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AZ1KR2Z1J4AXC	Beverly E McNamara	&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; at first glimpse looks like an orignal horror film with an artistic 'edge' to it - but it's anything but original or artistic.This film was completely disappointing. All [I MEAN ALL] of  the interesting scenes in this film were either already done in  &quot;Poltergeist&quot; or were just not explained AT ALL. In fact, very  few things were explained in this film. The acting by some [NOT THE CHILD -  I FOUND HIM ANNOYING] was good and there were some startling scenes, but  this is nothing to drool over.It is amazing to me how this was  nominated for Best Picture for the upcoming Academy Awards when excellent  and ORIGINAL films like &quot;Magnolia&quot; and &quot;Election&quot; were  left out. I was angry. The Wall Street Journal felt the same way. It was  big surprise - I will admit - but not a pleasant one.I am a teenager and  whenever I go to the movies I don't expect much - just something that will  entertain me. When I left the theater after seeing this, it left an empty  feeling in me - because I didn't understand why anything happened the way  it did. When the young boy is trapped upstairs in the room, he screams and  his mother finds cuts on him. NEVER EXPLAINED. When the mother all of a  sudden notices that there is a &quot;ghost&quot; in some family pictures?  LAME. Oh - and most of the acting - LAME as well. Certain parts of this  film, however, were entertaining - and that is why I gave it 2 stars, not  1. The ending was nice, although it doesn't fit with some other parts of  the film. I won't talk about it b/c some of you haven't seen this - I know  that. I'm warning you though- don't trust the hype.

Its believability is  down to the fanstastic acting of all players, especially Haley Joel Osment  and Shyamalan's delicate touch. These, together with a great score has to  make it one of the most atmospheric movies you are likely to see. Casting  Willis as a child psychologist must have had some risks but he pulls it off  so well.The whole pretext of this movie is in the question who is  helping whom? Is Malcom helping Cole come to terms with his psychological  affliction? Is Cole helping Malcom improve his relationship with his wife?  Is Cole helping his mother come to terms with her feelings for her  mother?It is not often you get a movie with this kind of impact, but in  the same way that Cole's ghosts walk with him, this film will stay with you  for a long time.Don't get too caught up with the twist hype - I guessed  what it was most likely to be before I even saw the movie but I was not  prepared for the way it unfolded.	5.0	As good on DVD as it was in the cinema	2000-04-07	6	5	1

Haley Joel Osment is awesome; i hope he continues to find scripts that  are a challenge for him. there are a lot of really neat camera angles and  such that you wouldn'y normally think about using.  if you are looking for  a blood and guts horror movie, don't see this, because that's not what it  is.  rather, it deals more with psychological issues and pulls in your  emotions, rather than your fear.  i too am somwhat annoyed that the DVD  makes you watch the previews, but i think i can deal with it.  it certainly  isn't going to stop me from watching it again.  like Thomas Crown Affair,  the ending does surpirse you, and is a big part of the movie's appeal, but  t shouldn't keep you from multiple viewings.  overall, i think this is a  great movie, and it has been added to my family's list of favorites.	5.0	i think this is a great movie.	2000-04-10	24	20	4

For example, in one scene Willis is sitting opposite Cole's mom in their living room when Cole comes home from school.  So how did he get in there?  Well, an intelligent person would think he would have talked to the mom before just barging in and sitting down.  Did he do this?  No.  According to the ""surprise"" ending, he actually let himself in the house, sat down across from Cole's mom, said nothing, and just sat there, not paying any attention to the fact that she didn't notice him.This movie is incredibly stupid.

Haley Joel Osment (""A.I."") plays a boy with the power to see ghosts -- and he sees them everywhere. Bruce Willis (""Armageddon"") is the psychiatrist who at first tries to help the boy with what he thinks are delusions, but soon grows to believe in.Shyamalan's ""Signs"" is another great scary flick, and for a simple reason: Shyamalan knows the secret to horror. It's all about the quick, fleeting glances of the darkness. It's all about building up the proper, terrified state of mind. I've never considered slasher flicks like ""Halloween"" or the endless ""Friday the 13th"" sequels to be even remotely scary.  Shyamalan knows that what you imagine is scarier than what he can show you, and he uses it.""The Sixth Sense"" pulls you in and makes you feel for these characters before the resolution, followed by what has become one of the most famous twists in recent cinema history.This Vista Series DVD is a great presentation, as well.

An award-winning child psychologist, Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) attempts to council Cole, believing that his problem is one of unchecked childhood fantasy, or mild schitzophrenia.Dr. Crowe realizes that Cole's symptoms are remarkably similar to those of a former patient, and reviews tapes of that patients sessions.  What he hears changes his mind about Cole... his previous patient wasn't imagining ghostly voices, they were real, and could be heard faintly in the background of the tape.Now being aware of the reality of Cole's condition, and that what was assumed to be mental illness is really uncontrolled mediumistic ability, Dr. Crowe assists the young boy in communicating with the spirits to determine what they want.The real twist to the story comes as Dr. Crowe realizes that he, too, is dead (killed by his first mediumistic patient) and only Cole can communicate with him.The realism of this movie is what makes it so frightening.  For instance, the accurate depiction of the temperature dropping in the presence of a ghoist... something most parapsychological authorities agree on.  Or the ability to capture ghostly images on film, and voices on audio tape.Thank you, M. Night Shyamalan (director) for not resulting to the usual special effects, or groaning chain-rattling depictions of ghosts.  This movie is sure to become a classic for all fans of supernatural horror, and those familiar with the real thing.	5.0	Scary, and real	2000-12-18	2	0	2
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A9T2V3QTWVIVP	Bobbye	Psychological thrillers have always been a favorite story line for me. I listened and watched intently as Cole and Matthew drew on the strenths and weaknesses of each other-fascinated at the growth of fear in each. At the  beginning, Matthew, the doctor, was calm, patient and wanting to help Cole  because, as a therapist, he had failed a patient in the past-someone like  Cole. But as Cole draws closer to Matthew and begins to verbalize his  terrors, Matthew begins to draw away as he faces......Well, you have to  watch the ending to know that, but when you do, you'll want to go right  back to the beginning-and when you do that, you'll be amazed at what you  missed the first time!

They get 5 stars. Nice moody atmosphere combines with the 'give them the plot in little bites' approach that forces the viewer to keep up dating their understanding of the movie. But the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point with it attempt at a trick ending. Too much 'it just happened that way' plot devices and Bruce Willis isn't enough of an actor to make it work.	3.0	Good movie if you don't look too close	2004-12-29	10	2	8
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1NL41UM76CFSO	"Bob L ""Bob L"""	Based on the rave reviews of this movie from friends and co-workers I went out and bought the DVD. First of all I notice many of the reviewers of the DVD version had complaints about the previews at the begining of the disc.  I was able to just skip right by them and start the movie in a matter of a  few seconds, so I don't understand all the gripes about that.  I thought  the movie itself was very good, if not quite up to the hype, but then how  often does a movie live up to the hype?  I didn't really consider it a  &quot;thriller&quot; in the classsic sense, but that didn't detract from my  enjoyment either.  It was very well acted by the main stars, especially  young Haley.  His performance was certainly worthy of the nomination and  probaly the Oscar as well, although I haven't seen &quot;Cider House&quot;  to judge Micheal Caine's performance.  Bruce Willis did a fine job too,  quite a change from the well-worn John McClane role.  As for the  unforeseen twist ending, well, I guessed it only a few minutes into the  film and was able to confirm it by the clues provided throughout(they're  there, you just have to know what to notice).  But again this didn't  detract from the overall quality and enjoyment of the film.  As far as  being worthy of the Oscar for best pic- I'd have to go with &quot;The Green  Mile&quot;, but that's just my opinion, I could be wrong...	4.0	Six Senses, Four Stars	2000-04-07	0	0	0

Shyamalan's films are characterized by being plodding and moody, always with a ""surprise"" ending. Well, sorry, what he conceives of as being profound and clever, I see as lumbering and predictable.There are people whose films I like, those whose films I admire, those whose work I admire more than I like, and those whose work I like more than I admire. At the ends of the spectrum are those whose work I both admire and like and those whose work I neither admire nor like. Shyamalan is in this latter group.If you like any other of his films, you're probable slow enough to like this one. Otherwise, avoid at all costs!"	1.0	Another M.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3R4TS03ITT2JC	Bob Thompson	The Sixth Sene is a perfect example of how people have become obsessed with parts of movies and not movies as a whole.While watching The Sixth Sense I couldn't help but think how average this movie was. The script is  so-so at best, the acting (with the obvious excpetion of Haley Joel Osment)  is pretty average and the plot as a whole just seems like something that  you've seen before.Then comes the ending which is undeniably a great  twist. In fact the ending is really the only brilliant thing in this movie  and I believe people often overate this movie just because of it.The  Sixth Sense is nothing more than an average movie with a great  ending.The fact that this was nominated for best picture is even more  sickening. Then again The Green Mile was also nominated so it's fairly easy  to conclude that the Oscars have no credibility anymore.People glorify  the Sixth Sense in the same way that they glorified Saving Private Ryan.  They saw the opening beach sequence in that film and thought &quot;wow,  that part was so good, the rest of the film has to be good.&quot; Well it  wasn't at all. Did anybody care about the fact that each character in  Saving Private Ryan was nothing more than a cartoon charater? It was a  wonderful example of how Steven Spielberg cannot make a movie anymore  without having something big to distract the viewer from the fact that the  film is mediocre. Unfortunately the Sixth Sense suffers from the same  problems, it's nothing but mediocrity that impresses everyone because of  the finale.There are plenty of other better movies to see this year:  Magnolia, Fight Club, Eyes Wide Shut, American Beauty, Election, Sweet and  Lowdown, Go, The Insider, The Limey, Being John Malkovich...

I dislike more of  his movies than I like, but in this one he is first rate.  Haley Joel  Osment, who I had only seen twice before(Forrest Gump and the Jeff  Foxworthy Show), also gives a terrific performance and should have an Oscar  sitting on his shelf. The commentary and deleted scenes added to my  enjoyment.  I felt like this movie could have went another forty-five  minutes or an hour even, and it still would have been very enjoyable.  I  think kids might enjoy it too, as long as they had an adult there with them  during some of the intense stuff.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A535HK7A55JGR	Brendan Donegan	One thing that is true about The Sixth Sense is that it is an especially creepy film. The way in which Shylaman builds up the suspense is terrific, letting the audience wait until about halfway through the film before the  first physical encounter with a ghost. One of the main things that made the  film so chilling is that the ghosts seem to have retained there injuries  after they have died. These injuries range from smashed in heads to burnt  flesh and all this makes The Sixth Sense much more horrifying for it.And  that is exactly what The Sixth Sense came very close to being, a horror  film. Except The Sixth Sense is like a horror film with brains, not relying  on gore and cheap shocks to scare the audience, instead making us scared in  a much subtler way. All the actors put up great performances, with Bruce  Willis probably putting up the greatest performance of his life.In the  end The Sixth Sense is a good film but not a great film, only being let  down by one or two less interesting scenes where nothing nuch goes on. And  one more thing. Theres an absolutely fantastic twist at the end.	4.0	The Sixth Sense	2000-03-15	25	22	3

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1C6JRA7L2L4RI	Bret Urick	There has been a lot of criticism surrounding &quot;the Sixth Sense&quot;, most of which is aimed at the movie's supernatural issues.  It is said that the movie is quite a boring ghost story with very few frightening moments.  But by looking at this wonderful movie as merely a horror movie is to  completely miss the movie's main and psychologically deep themes.  Above  all, &quot;the Sixth Sense&quot; is not a ghost story, nor is it a horror  film.  Rather, it is an in depth study of the human psychology....with a  few ghosts thrown in to aid in the characters' development.  It is a story  of communication and how we must all learn to speak to the world around us,  acknowledge its existence rather than build our own mental and emotional  walls to protect ourselves from the ills of the world.  It is about leaving  your safety net behind and venturing out into unknown regions, thus finding  your true self.  Foremost, it is about how we should not view ourselves as  spearate islands but as a single continent of humanity, living and dead,  who continue life after death.  Therefore, if you come into &quot;the Sixth  Sense&quot; expecting a spine-chilling horror flick, you will be sorely  disappointed.  This movie has intelligence, a phenomenal script, some of  the BEST acting in years (especially from young Haley Joel Osment), and a  truly touching message that rings true for all of humanity.  I give this  movie 5 out of 5 stars.  If it were possible, I'd give it more.  10 out of  5 stars.  20 out of 5 stars.  By far the best movie of 1999, and one of  the best of the decade.  And please, communicate with each other.  We are  all in this together.	5.0	Not a Mere Ghost Story...Best Movie of 1999	2000-03-08	3	3	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A141HP4LYPWMSR	Brian E. Erland	"The '99 film `The Sixth Sense' is a masterfully conceived and executed tale of the supernatural about a young boy named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who has the ability to see and converse with the spirits of the dead. Cole's ""gift"" is perceived by his Mother and the authorities as problematic, requiring professional help. When child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) offers his assistance to the troubled youth the two embark on a journey of self discovery that is totally unexpected for both the psychologist and the viewing audience.This is an amazing film that expertly utilizes a type of cinematic deception, slight of hand and misdirection that leads you to think you know what's going on only to shock you at the end. Haley Joel Osment is amazing and Bruce Willis delivers a superb but subdued performance that allows his character to fly under the radar until the surprise ending.

Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy Bruce Willis.  But I thought, regardless of how much I like Bruce Willis, most thrillier/suspense movies have been done, if not overdone.Well I was wrong on this count.  This was an extreamly well done & thought provoking movie.  With a well thought out story/plotline, excellent acting, & an extreamely excellent ending twist.  The acting was great.  And Shamala's directitorial debut was a massive smash hit.  I mean most directors take about 2 to 3 movies before they at least start to make a good movie.  Not in this case.  Although I daresay his other movies haven't quit been up to parr.

Shyamalan does a great job of setting up the tension using lighting on otherwise inanimate objects, like statues on buildings, as well as odd shots, like high above entrances, which at once create both a distance and tension.  Bruce Willis plays a psychiatrist who is attempting to redeem himself by helping a young boy, Haley Joel Osment, who seems beyond help.  Osment is very intelligent and holds a dark secret which Willis attempts to bring out.  The story-line, cinematography, characters, and site locations all work together to the surprising climax and final revelation.

Some have already said it's a bad idea. I want anyone who doesn't have the DVD to know once you insert the disk it  plays the standard Studio/FBI intro as usual, which you can't push the  &quot;menu&quot; button for, and goes straight into a LONG session of  previews for other movies, which you also can't press the Menu button  on.I'm all for having previews on disks (and in fact I am frequently  disappointed when the menu shows single slide ads for other movies but no  actual preview), and would encourage all studios to add them where there is  space on the disk.HOWEVER... I think we need to make a stand and make  sure the studios don't do this again, not this studio, not other studios.  Do not put the previews at the front without a menu option! Do not, do not,  do not!Yes, please use the empty space on the disk to ad previews, but  give us as people who BUY the movie the choice to choose them from the  menu, don't shove them down our throats! If you want to do a different  build for the rental releases thats fine, but as someone who purchased this  movie outright, I object to being forced to sit through the previews.The  movie is a 5 star movie for sure, this DVD package with the damnable ads  should be avoided at all costs.Start a campaign, make sure the studios  know we want the previews, but only as a menu choice if we choose to make  it!

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1LDMDMUBJSUN4	Bruce E. Munck	"M. Night Shyamalan hit a towering home-run with this movie. In a year (1999) noted for some good films this one stood head and shoulders above the rest. I won't delve into any of the film's specifics since so much has already been written about it, and I don't want to ruin anything for someone who might actually have missed this flick (incredible as it might seem). I simply want to echo the sentiments of so many others who feel, as I do, that this is one of the all time great creepy films and can stand its own against just about any of them. This movie overshadowed another eerie thriller that year, ""Stir of Echoes"", which is very much worth a viewing as well. Unfortunately Mr. Shyamalan has not been able to recreate the success of this movie although he has given it quite an effort. ""Signs"", ""Unbreakable"", ""The Village"", are all okay movies, but none come close to ""The Sixth Sense"". I also own this movie in the two-disc Special Edition DVD version and wanted to see it in higher-def. For the current price levels you may as well opt for Blu-Ray since it is a bit better quality, but the movie stands on its own and is a good view even in VHS if that's what you have. I certainly recommend this movie to anyone wanting a three-dimensional experience (sight, sound, and feeling the hairs on your arms stand on end and prickle!)"	5.0	Genuinely Creepy!	2012-06-25	1	1	0

Willis' portrayal as the tormented child psychologist Malcolm Crowe is sensitive and compassionate, a beautifully realized, complete performance. And Osment's performance as the disturbed child Cole who has &quot;the sixth sense&quot; is astonishing--in my opinion, it's the best performance by a child actor in film since Patty Duke in &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;. The wonderful relationship that evolves between Malcolm and Cole is worth the price of admission alone. Also kudos to Toni Collette as Cole's ever-loving, always supportive Mom; to Olivia Williams as Malcolm's wife (in hindsight, one realizes that Williams pulls off an incredibly difficult technical piece of acting), and Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent, the anguished, tortured young man whom Malcolm could not save.  Brilliant, disturbing, evoking laughter, tears, chills, and a great deal of thought, this is great film making.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1NPNGWBVD9AK3	"Bruce Kendall ""BEK"""	Actually, watching the DVD of &lt;Unbreakable&gt; prompted this review. Both feature Bruce Willis in the starring role and are &quot;eerily&quot; similar in their cinematic tricks. We get lots of vague, essentially nebulous lighting (I really do need to get glasses, I guess!)and thinly-construed plot. Shyamalan is regarded in Hollywood circles as the next Steven Speilberg, but what he serves up is rather thin gruel in the larger scheme of things, even though after wincing through A.I. I see the validity of the comparisons (Sorry, Steve, I really did love &lt;Schindler's, one of the great films of the century&gt;).What this film fails to deliver is the type of dramatic tension that is evident in such masterpieces as &lt;The Innocents&gt; (an immensely well-crafted child-oriented ghost tale adapted from Henry James' &lt;The Turn of the Screw&gt;, screenplay by Truman Capote, and &lt;Jacob's Ladder&gt;, neglected pretty much by the Oscar committee and the mainstream press, but infinitely savvier and scarier than this imitation. In fact, &lt;Jacob's Ladder&gt; has almost the exact same ending as &lt;The Sixth Sense&gt;, but I've never seen or heard of M. Night Shyamalan giving credit to this earlier, superior, screenplay. Perhaps it's about time.	3.0	OK, but Way Over-hyped	2001-08-04	23	8	15
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1GB1Q193DNFGR	Bruce Lee Pullen	M. Night Shyamalan's sleeper hit The Sixth Sense is an outstanding surrealstic supernatural character study that showcases unusually restrained and effective acting by Bruce Willis as a dedicated child  psychologist who after receiving an award for his superb work in his field  gets an unexpected visit by a previous patient who shots Willis and then  turns his gun on himself. This traumatic event starts a downward spiral in  Willis's life that leaves him with nothing but his work with a troubled  young child. Haley Joel Osment, in an Oscar caliber performance, plays an  emotionally distressed boy who is blessed or cursed with the ability to see  and interact with the spirits of the dead. Osment's star-making performance  shines with more passionate human emotion and authenticfear than any child  performance since Linda Blair in the Exorcist (1973). What makes this film  drastically different than the convential horror or suspence film, is that  this film takes itself seriously by allowing the  characters, plot, and  locale to gradually build to where the audience feels as if boys like  Osment actually due exist somewhere in America. The Sixth Sense will be  remembered in years to come as an atmospheric suspence classic that  cleverly dealt wih its subject honestly enough to make itself feel fresh  and engaging everytime you watch it.	5.0	Brillance Can Be Sensed By All	2000-03-08	3	1	2

Altho' I always know the outcome, the excellent acting of (then) young Haley Joel Osment, and the palpable chemistry between him & both his mother (played by Toni Collette) and his therapist (played by Bruce Willis) make this movie a viewing pleasure time and again.  My favorite scene is at the end of the movie when he & his mother are in the car, and he's ""ready to talk about his secrets.""

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2MMM6JGI7IRBK	Burt Flemming	So, without being a spoiler, let me just say that this movie has some serious plot holes -- ones big enough to drive a truck through.  Its big gimmic -- the plot twist at the end -- doesn't work out as well as the director would have us believe (review his comments on the DVD).  Without giving anything away, let me phrase it like this: many of the scenes involving Bruce Willis cut directly to his already having entered the room in which the seen takes place.  If the plot twist is to be believed, Willis either magically appeared in these places and didn't realize that he hadn't arrived by normal means, or there's something really wrong with the plot.  IOW, not only is the audience unaware of his situation, neither is he himself, which makes no sense given the mechanics of getting a person into and out of a room.I don't want to spoil it, so I won't get any more specific.  Watch the DVD and see if you don't agree.  You may have to watch it twice to see what I mean.  The most glaring problems are when Willis is sitting in the living room with the boy's mother, when he joins his wife for dinner, and when he attends the funernal and the play near the end of the movie.	3.0	Good movie, but has some plot holes	2002-03-17	4	0	4
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3HTX1NOTTWERP	Busy Body	"When I first saw The Sixth Sense way back in January 2000, I remember being absolutely amazed and stunned by the excellence of this film. I'd never seen a film that - while being slow paced - gripped me for the entire time I watched it. The Sixth Sense was THE film of 1999, and went on to become the most successful horror movie in the history of recorded film - grossing $679.4 million worldwide by April 2000. There were a number of highly successful horror films of the 1990's such as The Blair Witch Project, The Haunting, House On Haunted Hill and the Scream trilogy. This doesn't mean to say they were any good. The Sixth Sense is a rare film that deals with ghosts and psychic ability in such a realistic manner, that was a welcome change from all the silly slasher-type films - and a perfect one to round off the decade...The Sixth Sense revolves around two main characters; Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Malcolm is an award-winning child psychologist who is happily married to his considerably younger wife, Anna (Olivia Williams). They are relaxing one night at their home, when Malcolm is shot by one of his former, now-adult patients, Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg). The film continues months later. Malcolm has apparently recovered from the shooting and becomes involved with a new patient, nine-year-old Cole Sear. Cole's parents are divorced and he has no close friends - infact, his closest friend ""hates him."" Cole's mother, Lynn (Toni Collette) begins to notice that her son isn't happy, and that maybe something's going on in which he won't tell her - like finding cuts and bruises on Cole's back. A while into the film, Cole confides in Malcolm that he sees dead people - walking around like ordinary people. And that he sees them ""all the time."" Malcolm isn't sure whether to believe him or not, but stumbles across a recorded tape way back when he was involved with Vincent Grey. On the tape, Malcolm leaves the room with only Vincent is in there. It's clear from the tape (when Malcolm increases the volume) that someone else is in there with Vincent. Malcolm comes up with the suggestion that Cole must face his fears and communicate with these dead people - see what they want, and why the keep following him around. In return, Cole helps Malcolm with problems that he's experiencing with his wife - she won't talk to him, and he doesn't know why. Malcolm's discovery in the end has to be one of the best and most shocking twists in cinematic history.The factor that makes The Sixth Sense so superb is the extraordinary acting skills of Haley Joel Osment. I have seen quite a lot of movies, and the acting of Osment in The Sixth Sense is absolutely amazing. After each major scene in which something truly gripping occurs, the screen fades to black - giving it a touch to it that makes it unique. I remember watching this film last night on terrestrial TV, and (now a few years down the line after it's initial release) realising that a wide variety of scenes in The Sixth Sense have already reached classic status. The one where the dead girl grabs Cole's leg from underneath her bed is a perfect example of this - the expression on Cole's face making it all the more iconic. The scene with the girl being sick in Cole's red tent is another (the tent constantly being used as a metaphor by children as a means of protection), along with the hospital bed scene which sparked a worldwide catchphrase; ""I see dead people!"" Director M. Night Shyamalan is superb, and with classic films such as The Sixth Sense and the superb Signs, is definitely on his way to becoming the new Spielberg. I have seen a lot of films in which Bruce Willis stars, and I have to say this is one of the best. He takes a backseat to his macho stereotype, and the effects are very rewarding. Willis is very believable as a softer, more gentle character in the form of Malcolm. Toni Collette plays the confused single mother image extremely well. At first it's difficult to distinguish whether she is protective or abusive towards Cole - but as the film picks up momentum, it's obviously the former.OVERALL GRADE: 10/10The Sixth Sense is officially the highest-grossing horror film in history, which surprises me a little. The film received hardly any publicity until after its success at awards ceremonies. I have now seen The Sixth Sense about 10 times, and never tire of watching it. Of course, the film cannot be viewed day after day (as this would just be too repetitive), but once every three or four months still manages to thrill you in a way no other film did before it, or any film that will in the future."	5.0	A Massive Horror Masterpiece	2003-02-03	7	5	2

However, he really shows his acting stuff  here and I'll give the devil his due!  There are some inconsistencies in  the story that my husband, friends and I picked apart later in a coffee  shop but, as a whole, it had such a great impact that I can't take off for  those.

I thought this would be scary because of what people were telling me and from what I read.  I was scared by about 2 scenes.  Two.  The movie was long, boring and the ending??? Absurd.  Hard for me to believe the guy didn't know he was dead for over a year.  You'd think that if your marriage was falling apart, you'd try to talk to the person, touch the person to get his/her attention, etc.  Nope.  In this movie he just kind of threw up his hands and accepted that his marriage was falling apart and that his wife didn't want to talk to him.  Reaaaally stupid.  The movie was oh so very overrated, and I'm glad I didn't watch it in the theater.  M. Night Shamylan or whatever the director's name is, he has done some lame-o overrated movies.  ""Unbreakable"" was lame.  ""Signs"" was lame.  Please, Mr. Shamylan, do us all a favor and stop making lame movies.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A27NSZP2PPGW6Z	Carra R Lane	THE 6TH SENSE = a deeply weak movie, so glitzy & faux that it actually damages eager-to-be-insulted audience directly. Which is unusual? Kitsch normally just diverts money away from honest effort, is the layer of commercial scum obscuring the nice roots of anything: Hank Williams Jr. instead of his more sincerely pitiful whining father. Or whatever will happen when marketably witless ghostly sentimentality prevails?M. Night can't script. No real story/plot/characterization, just cinema atmosphere, a nice vogue look, lovely disconnected bits? A pre-robotic Haley Joel Osment is cute, professional, denatured/stiff, a pint-sized sensitive New Age adult. He's TOO good? His performance is exquisite, rings precocious/false, Culkinized, the polar opposite of Mary Badham's Scout Finch (TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD). Could have been an audition for AI? Bruce Willis is miscast, tones himself down nicely to no purpose: the whole project strains credulity past exaggerated action/adventure. The kid's mother is NOT a bit part but is never honestly built? What little IS suggested fully excuses her son's father for leaving or, if necessary, dying? None of the other players has much to do. Nothing connects in a sensible (or parasensible?) way, but everything that can be done is done FOR or well done or perhaps overcooked. Idiot-proofing? Works like Windows when Windows works? M. Night Shyamalan is Spielberg minus Steven's occasional bursts of humor &/or interest in substantial subject matter. His belief that he can/should write seems likely to lead to a string of very empty very popular movies.In order to earn directly damaging, a lowest-common-denominator flick has to be soma-like. No heart, red or black or gold, no fable. Dumb & dumber stuff. Enquiring minds? The indirect damage is typical & simple. Dollars churning around in the M. Night movie economy are unavailable for making/buying more interesting/curious art of any sort. The distinction is, in cartoon terms, the difference between Rocky/Bullwinkle (with Sherman/Peabody) & Mickey Mouse/Fantasia? Irritating to we who can't buy Disney, plain or kaleidescopic, who prefer our fairy tales fractured/funny, prefer our lemonade with sugar, or at least corn syrup, not saccharin? Even if this kind of preference rots our teeth?	1.0	HOME ALONE MEETS DEAD SOULS IN ROSWELL?	2002-09-09	13	4	9

He might even be considered a wuss.  Someone breaks into his house and he points out to them that there are no drugs or needles around, and he will call the police if necessary.  I just had to shake my head, seeing that.  By the way, he did a great job of it.  You believed that he was a child psychologist who had just received an award from a grateful city.Haley Joel Osmet was a compelling, but strange, 9 year old.  When he explains his 'gift' to his mother, I... hm.  It just inspired this giant nameless emotion in me.  In retrospect, I'm just in awe that it could happen.This movie just did everything &quot;more&quot; than other movies.  The gore wasn't terribly gory, but it did grab you (me anyway, but I'm a wimp that way).  The ending was... just amazing.

My second mistake was watching it at night. Alone. In the dark.Not so much scary as it is just plain creepy (far worse in my opinion), this movie goes for a couple of big &quot;jump out of your seat&quot; moments, which usually happen after long periods of creepy, suspenseful build up. For several nights after I saw this movie I had to make sure that the lights were on in whatever room I was in. As a die-hard horror/thriller fan, it takes a LOT to spook me like this one did.The acting is pretty good, although I don't think it was the Oscar-calliber that the movie's hype led me to expect. However, the same story in the hands of any other director and actors would have sucked the creepiness from the story and left just your average scary movie.	5.0	Can't watch it in the dark	2004-07-22	1	1	0

It is really, really creepy, so even if you see it a bunch of times (like I have), you still react to it the same way as if you have seen it for the first time. This movie has an excellent cast. Bruce Willis tends to be under-emotional in movies, but in this one he is magnificent. This isn't your average thriller. It doesn't have a million scary things happening at once, so the suspense is almost unbearable in some parts. That's what makes a good scary movie.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A32BGKYAI367RE	"""cenobite_"""	Here it comes. The movie we've all been waiting for. On the onehand it's 'creepy' and 'a treat for horror fans', but it also 'hasbrains' and 'will please demanding viewers'.  And so you can imagine how much I was looking forward to watching this movie. And what a letdown it was. It reminded me of a cheap soap opera rather than of an intelligent mystery story. The relationships between the boy and his mother or between Willis' character and his wife made up a great part of the movie and were full of all the clichees we have to watch in any Hollywood tearjerker. The 'horror' part of the story was not much better, though. And the ending is unbelievable I seriously asked myself what made Bruce Willis star in this horrible flick. Willis' performance is not bad, though he's already been better, but the boy becomes really annoying after the first ten minutes.  The rest of the cast is forgettable.So that was it? Cut down to 30 minutes and aired on cable TV it might have been an okay entry in a mystery TV series, sometime between 'Ally McBeal' and 'The X-Files'. But as a full-length-feature it bored me more than any other 1999 movie (except for The Other Sister, maybe) - and take in consideration that I sat through such disastrous movies as The Thirteenth Warrior and Star Wars: Episode One.To me, anyway, The Sixth Sense is full of clichees, offers nothing new, has a story that lacks any plausibility, and is really, really boring from the beginning to the end.	1.0	Supernatural tearjerker	2000-03-19	35	11	24
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3AY3EV2MFRFGG	"Chadwick H. Saxelid ""Bookworm"""	Some reviewers wondered why this movie was such a huge hit, despite being a low key and special effects light thriller.  That answer, when you strip away the twist ending everybody just had to see, was in the subtext of families being healed after a traumatic loss.  Just substitute in divorce instead of death and the resonance becomes clearer, much the same way many parents empathized with the discarded and forgotten toys of Toy Story 2.  All through the movie we see Willis's character, a fallen and broken man, continually trying to reconnect with his apparently estranged wife and his young patient, a surrogate son of sorts.  That the ghosts the boy sees are primarily victims of domestic abuse or simple neglect only further the subtext of a needed healing.  Whether you find the film 'scary' or not is a non-issue with me, for The Sixth Sense shows how rich, intelligent, and textured supernaturally themed drama can be.The disc comes with hours of bonuses which include commentary, deleted scenes, trailers, and behind the scenes info.  The extras are nice, but even if it were just the movie on the disc it would still be a required addition to any ghost story fans library.

Now the thing that made it great for me was on DVD was the first time i ever saw it. Noone eevr told me the ending and I am happy about that, But however if you have seen the movie then the DVD is not really worth it as there is nothing else to see. They have an alternate ending, but it is essentially the same just done differently. What I did like was the superior performance of Bruce WIllis as he as usual stole the movie.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3UWPJF8UU4A9U	Che	I do not understand why people think this is a scary/horror movie? I was all pumped up ready to go see it. I bought the DVD the day it came out, watched it, and the next thing you know, it was over! I was disappointed,  not because of the movie, but everyone said that it's scary when it wasn't.  This was a good boost for up and coming director, M. Night Shyamalan. A  good role for diverse actor (yes, DIVERSE), Bruce Willis. It will also mark  the careers of oscar nominees Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette. Bruce  plays Malcolm Crowe, a Psychologist that tries to help Cole (played by  Osment), a child with visions of dead people.The key to this movie, if  you've never seen it, is not knowing the ending!  If someone tells you the  ending, it literally ruins it for you! I'm fortunate enough to have watched  it without knowing the ending. It's pretty sad, the outcome of the movie. I  felt empty harted, sad, and mad. It left me hanging. Watching it the 2nd  time wasn't the same as the 1st, since you know the ending. It does give  you a chance to look at the clues throughout the movie. The DVD edition is  special. It has a bunch of commentaries and stuff. Overall, I thought it  was a good movie but not a great one like everyone else said it was!	4.0	Why do people think this is a scary/horror movie?	2000-07-25	2	0	2
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A23MZ5EULW2GHH	"C. Heinrich ""wsidechris"""	I think I've seen too many movies, but I was disappointed by this one.  Images of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot;, &quot;Angel Heart&quot;, and others raced through my mind.I was thrilled with the film's lack of violence, and I liked the antique (though glossy) look of the film.  And of course there were some good performances, most notably young Osment and Toni Colette (their moments together are the best in the film).  Bruce Willis was okay, but after the &quot;surprise&quot; ending, I guess I found his performance adequate.I guess I am somewhat let down by the hype of the film.  If I were a younger, less knowledgable and less educated filmgoer, I probably would have liked it more.  But I can't seem to forget good films I've already seen.  Or, just call me a snob (I guess I kind of am when it comes to art).To make things worse, the video features an interview with writer/director M. Night Shyamalan.  This guy has a tremendously inflated view of this film (and himself)!  You'd think he had created the next &quot;Godfather&quot;.  And, in accordance with the modern times, he went on and on about how much money the film made; as if that makes it a great film.  Let's remember that the single &quot;Physical&quot; by Olivia Newton John was a #1 hit for 10 weeks in 1981.  Topping the charts and getting people to talk about something do not a great piece of art make.  Spare us the talk about making a cultural impact with this film because of the box office draw and people quoting the line &quot;I see dead people&quot;.  It worries me about the future of filmmaking.  I wonder what other &quot;great&quot; films are going to be created by &quot;ball-playing, Big Mac-eating&quot; kids that spent their youth hanging out in malls.	3.0	If you've seen great films, this will be average at best	2001-03-31	5	1	4

Many have scared the socks off of their poor audience, with a paticular tip of the hat to &quot;The Blair Witch Project,&quot; but this  movie is different.  The movie tells you with its story, its tone, and its  color that something will happen, but you can not put your finger on it  until the end.  The movie supports no &quot;cheap scares&quot; present in  movies like Scream in which a scene is not scary, just sudden and  startling. This movie, &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; Will make you afraid.  Afraid of the dark, and afraid of being alone.  The genuine surprise ending  added closure to a genuine 21st century scary movie.  And, with added  footage, you will not want to miss &quot;The Sixth Sense.&quot;  Note: This  movie is only for those who are not afraid to be truly afraid.	5.0	You don't need a &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; to tell this one is good!	2000-01-23	83	71	12

Bruce Willis is excellent as Malcolm Crowe, an acclaimed child psychologist. Also, his life was on top. He and his wife were happily in love and he had just received an award from the city. However, there was one kid, now teenager, whom Malcolm could not help. That left Malcolm haunting and lingering memories. Go forward into the future. Malcolm is now sad and depressed. His wife is completely ignoring Malcolm and his whole world is upside down. One day, Malcolm meets Cole Sear (brilliantly played by Haley Joel Osment.) Cole is seeing dead people, the exact problem of the kid Malcolm could never help. At first, Malcolm is convinced that Cole is just imagining things. After a while, Malcolm starts to change his mind. Seeing is believing.M. Night Shaymalan is a talented director and writer. He is able to make The Sixth Sense spooky in a way that doesn't require too much special effects. Just the perfect camera angles and music. Also to note, Haley Joel Osment was nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor.	5.0	The Perfect Film To Give You Nightmares	2001-08-31	2	1	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1FJ1U5LKD87RA	"C. Lyles ""Movie Seer"""	"The Sixth Sense was the first film M. Night Shyamalan directed where I learned of his name. The film was especially intriguing, in my opinion, because it focused on the nature of fear rather than just being afraid.  Some who love ""horror"" films may tend to treat them as if though they are action films, where they enjoy seeing the victim run away from a seemingly indestructible foe bent on mass murder with no cause behind it.  We laugh and say how stupid that person is for tripping while trying to get away rather than making it past the door entirely, so to speak.  Others may just want to be scared out their theater seats.  This effect may not be what Shyamalan is trying to achieve with this film.The fear in this film is not being projected towards us, the viewers, but towards the characters themselves.  The troubled protaganist, Cole Sear (played impressively by a young Haley Joel Osment), is being forced to deal with his fear in solitude since it is a form of it that not everyone can express.  This key point is what drives this impressive film.  The nature of fear is different for everyone, and through Cole's visions, we get a glimspe of what it is that truly scares him.  Not to give away anything specific, Cole sees something beyond ghosts.  He sees violence, pain, suffering, and most importantly, despair.  Each ghost he sees met its end in either a violent, painful, sufferable, or despairing way.  What Cole fears is actually the most deprecating aspects of human society: mankind's unwillingness to live  a peaceful life.  The only peace and stillness that Cole receives comes in the guise of Malcolm Crowe (another impressive turn for Bruce Willis).Like Cole, Malcolm has his own fears that he struggles with.  He fears the failure of his professional career, the seemingly impending failure of his marriage, and the possible failure of what type of man he seeks to be.  He buries this fear, letting no one see what it is that plagues him.  It is not until Malcolm and Cole establish their uneasy relationship where both individuals are able to seek some type of solace from their fears, an act that neither one could have accomplished on his own.  Just as love, hate, envy, jealousy, and other emotions can connect people with one another, fear can be just as powerful a bond as the others.  Fear essentially is the gravitas of this film.  People do not always need a saviour or hero to show them the way.  Simply sharing your differences and finding the common element between them can do just the trick.Other reviewers have used words like ""boring,"" ""ridiculous,"" and ""overrated"" when looking at this film.  Everyone has a right to his or her opinion.  However, where one person sees something boring, I see something insightful; where one person sees something ridiculous, I see something ever-presently intelligent; and where one person sees something overrated, I see something that is brave in its undertaking.  Make no mistake, I am not a film critic.  I could attempt to make some informed judgement on acting abilities, casting, plot, setting, and the likes.  But I respect the film industry enough to know that I am in no way qualified to make such judgments on a work of art, even if it is a movie.  Still, what I seek to communicate here is that sometimes, visionary directors want viewers to move past the surface and dig deeper, as archaeologists do, for the hidden meaning of things.  Shyamalan, I think, made a similar challenge in this film.  He may be saying that to be afraid is one thing, but more can come from it.  Anyone can be scared by any number of things, whether it is a dead man in a hockey mask hacking at teenagers with a machete, or a creature that was created or from outer space eating people to survive, or a serial killer with an omnipresent message of what it truly means to live who carves his powerful viewpoint on uncaring victims.  But to share your fear, and see how it too connects you to that unspoken realm of human existence is just as appealing and enlightening as knowing when to duck, run, and head for cover when something insane passes by with a malicious desire for murder in mind."	5.0	A True Gem of a Film With More Substance than Others May Admit	2008-04-14	3	3	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3OEECMCM2T4KQ	C. Middleton	"This is a film that has withstood the test of time. Despite viewing this haunting tale many times, and knowing its surprise ending, the story continues to intrigue, and still manages to reveal little nuances, details about the plot, that was missed during prior viewings. It is that type of picture, which should be studied, as it is a near perfect film.The Sixth Sense launched M. Night Shyamalan as a major writer and director with his own particular style of filmmaking. The Sixth Sense, fortunately, was not a one off, as Shyamalan has gone on to make further excellent films such as Unbreakable, Signs and The Village. This talented young man seems to have an innate gift for creating suspense and those subtle and not so subtle aspects of life that can cause us deep fear, things that truly frighten, without having to shove it in our faces. There are too many directors out there who feel they have to explode and shock, CGI-ing their audiences to death, in order to somehow keep us interested. These kinds of films have their place, however, the truly frightening films, like The Sixth Sense, rivets us to our chairs with subtle twists and turns, long suspenseful silences and the unexpected.A good example of this subtlety is right at the beginning of the film. The psychologist and his wife are having a celebration in their home. The doctor has won an award from the mayor and they're getting seriously stuck into the wine. Finishing a bottle, she goes down stairs to the cellar alone to retrieve another. The camera is placed behind the wine rack, as we view her reaching for a bottle, giving the distinct impression or perception, that we are in the room with her. She appears to hear something, voices, and her once joyful expression subtlety changes to one of fear. As the audience, we feel something terrible is about to happen, but we don't know exactly when or how.Another example is the many surprise manifestations of the dead that we see through the little boy's eyes. One of the more disturbing scenes is the woman in the dressing gown that he mistakes for his mother. He walks into the kitchen and the woman turns around revealing a battered face and fresh scars on her wrist from an attempted suicide. ""See what you've done to me!"" she screams. ""Look what I have to put up with!"" as the little boy runs to his room to hide in his tent, which he has made as a makeshift chapel, his sanctuary, away from the dead.We all enjoy the occasional scare, and there's nothing like a good ghost story to do it. What I find incredible about this film, though, is despite seeing it several times, knowing the story and its many surprises, it still manages to hold my attention and continues to create that feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach. The word ""classic"" has been bandied around a lot and attributed to films that don't deserve the label, but The Sixth Sense, in my opinion, deserves to be called a true classic of the genre, as it will continue to be appreciated for years to come."	5.0	"A True ""Classic"" of the Genre"	2005-05-10	4	2	2

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3DTUMLBZCG47D	Connor J. Hamilton	From the explosive beginning to the surprising end, The Sixth Sense engages the attention of any viewer who does not mind a movie devoid of violent explosions, extensive gunfire, and bedroom scenes. (Indeed, no film should contain the latter.)The heart of soul of the film is Cole Sear, a disturbed nine year-old who hides his run-ins with ghosts from everyone around him, including his mother. Actor Haley Joel Osment gives a stunningly mature and good performance, especially judging from the fact that he was not yet a teenager at the time. He is uniformly believable, and his character is very real--he is not one of those movie characters that makes you sick and eager to get the movie over with.Bruce Willis, playing the child phsychologist Malcolm Crowe, gives a very quiet performance, but still with plenty of feeling. He is not at all dry.You can tell from the get-go that M. Night Shyamalan is a master at his craft. The entire feel of the movie is perfect. From the silent views of doors inside a house, to an angry voice shouting from behind a door, he keeps up a very expectant suspense.

It was very good but I didn't find it as ""the greatest movie ever"" as some did. It is an involving story, however, and I've come to appreciate it more with multiple viewings. I've seen it three times, the last one looking for mistakes to disprove the surprise ending....but couldn't find any. The filmmakers covered their tracks. However, a couple of scenes were misleading. Those who have seen this movie know what I'm talking about. For those who haven't, I'm not going to spoil it here.I enjoyed both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the two leads. Willis has had many action-packed, profane macho roles in his career but I like him best when he's low key, as he is in here (and in ""Unbreakable,"" to name another fairly-recent movie)  Osment, meanwhile, is a terrific child actor, as he has proved in other films. He's simply one of the best of his young generation. He and Dakota Fanning are the two best child actors I've seen in many years.This isn't just some supernatural-horror movie. It's a nice human interest story. There is one scene late in the movie in which Osment's mom is having a talk with her young boy in the car. It is an extremely touching scene that brings tears - a great moment in the film."	4.0	Still Very Good Even When You Know The Ending	2007-09-16	1	0	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A316HU3BAFG0D2	"D. A. Martin ""Avid Reader"""	"The ""psychological thriller"" has always been my favorite genre of film making.  Such films are more challenging in that it takes a special cohesiveness between a director, screenwriter, and cast to craft a story that will get inside the viewer's head and stay there days - even weeks - after having seen the film.  Though heavy on the suspense (naturally), all of the ""scary stuff"" is implied, which I feel has a much stronger effect on the audience than the average run-of-the-mill fright flick.  ""The Sixth Sense"" is one of only two films that I have seen in my lifetime that pulls this off successfully (""The Silence of the Lambs"" being the first).I had never heard of writer-director M. Night Shyamalan before seeing this film, but I knew afterwards that this guy was indeed a gifted film maker/storyteller, cut from the ""Hitchcock mold,"" with a long and prosperous career ahead of him.  It didn't hurt that ""Sense"" went on to earn almost $300 million in box office sales in North America from its August 6-8, 1999 opening.  Yes, Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, and pint-sized powerhouse Haley Joel Osment all made for a fantastic cast, but it was Shyamalan's masterful directing and storytelling that made this one of the best suspense films of all time."	5.0	A Psychological Thriller Par Excellence!	2003-04-04	1	1	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	First I want to make it very clear, that while the film has it's frightening moments this is not a horror movie by any means and if that's what your looking for then you should look elsewhere.  That said, storywise, plotwise and actingwise, this is hands down the best supernatural film you will ever see.  Placed in the capable hands of writer/directer M. Night Shayamalan who proved he is a force to be reckond with as well as the very capable hands of actors Bruce Willis, Toni Colleti and Haley Joel Osment who well deserved the oscar nod this film rises above it's predesesors in that it reaches much more emotions than that of fear.  It reaches your heart as you watch this child deal with his 'gift' of sorts as well as Dr. Crowe (Willis) as he deals with the distance between him and his wife.  The ending is as shocking as they come and deffinatly earns itself recognition as Shyamalans best script (Unbreakable was good, and Village had its points but Signs was a complete mess)  I have to say that I have always found Bruce to be an impressive actor, but I felt that he was far too undertapped...and this performance prooves that he is more that just na action star and needs to be taken much more seriously...I would have liked to him take home an oscar nod for this.  The film revolves around Cole (Osment) and his ability to see dead people.  Crowe (Willis) is a child psyciatris who is trying to help Cole come to terms with his gifts.  It is truly touching as Crowe helps Cole find ways to make the ghost go away.  This is a great film that gives a new perspective to an old idea...In other words this is the one that started them all, this is the reinvention of the ghost story and because of the MAJOR success of this film we have other gems like 'The Ring' and 'What Lies Beneath'...	5.0	Powerhouse of a film!	2005-09-14	4	3	1
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1DOYVFA12C0KJ	daniel	The Sixth Sense has gone onto become the highest grossing thriller of all time so as you might image it's better than the trailer suggests.  The people at Touchstone decided to market this as a scary movie hoping to cash in at Halloween, if it had the legs to make it that far, and did it ever.  But not for the reasons you might expect.  Sense is a touching story of Cole, a confused young boy who sees ghosts and subsequently turns to a once-renowned psychitrist for help.  Bruce Willis plays the part of Dr. Crowe to subtle perfection (I'll bet you never thought you'd see the word subtle to describe the man who brough us Die Hard and Armageddon).  His disbelief in Cole lingers a little too long, but not long enough to weigh down the film's swift pace.  The pieces start to come together and by the end provide us with a good jolt that will make repeat-viewing a must.  It's a clever twist which the director had been building to all along and won't be caught by anyone but the most keen of viewers.  My advice is to watch it without expectations because if you buy into the hype you're bound to be disappointed.	4.0	A  Suprisingly  'Sense'-ative  Film	2000-10-13	1	1	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3BJHQSDEPOPTJ	Dan Reef	In August of 1999, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; opened worldwide and, since then, has been established as one of the more successful psychological thrillers in our time. Critics said it had everything anyone could want in a flick, and noone dared to give it anything but five stars. When I saw this from an entertainment standpoint, I could not figure out whether the slow-motion button on my remote was jammed or if &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; was an incredibly dull film that moved unbelievably slowly, and ended up nowhere. I eventually realized that the latter of the two answered my question. Yes, it is boring. No, it is not scary or entertaining in any way, shape or form. I would rather drop the gloves with Tie Domi than watch this pile of garbage movie again. But, I didn't hate it just because it was dull. There were plenty of other reasons why this movie is, in my honest opinion, the worst ever. Through the eyes of a critic, here are some mistakes that the critic's didn't catch. First of all, why is Cole a freak? He is only 8 years old and he walks and talks like the common person his age. Does it really make him that weird if he says that people were hung in what is now his elementary school? This is only bizarre if the person claiming it's truth is an adult. No disrepect to young boys like the one Haley Joel Osment portrays, but is it that uncommon for an 8-year old to say irrelevant things like he did? Next, why did he see visions of dead people? There are many twisted psychopath's in our society, but a common 8-year old who never hurt anyone would never have these kinds of hallucinations. In addition, the trailer for &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; always shows the part where Cole tells Bruce Willis that the corpses want him(Cole) to do things for them(deceased). Put plain and simple, NO THEY DON'T! Sometimes, they talk to him, but they never ask or demand him to do one thing. Finally, does an 8-year old really NEED psychological help? No, he does not need help. He may be a slightly pessimistic child, but does he really need psychological assistance? NO. After the movie is over, ask yourself, did Bruce Willis do anything to help Cole? What I'm saying is that Bruce Willis' character isn't even needed at all for this motion picture. WHAT IS HE, A SIDEKICK? Some of the reviews on Amazon just warn you that a movie is bad and advise you to avoid it. But, I wanted to provide a good explanation as to why I hated &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;. I hope you can understand why this is, in my opinion, the worst movie ever.	1.0	The Sixth Sense makes No Sense	2000-12-28	13	4	9

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	ANOJRF40V7E7D	Dave Webb	I saw this movie as soon as it was released. I believe it is best appreciated on the wide screen, but owning the video for me was an inevitability. I had never seen the same movie twice in a theater before.  After all, why pay to see a film again if you've already seen it? I saw The  Sixth Sense five times! The eerie atmosphere and music, the excellent  acting, and the incredibly written script, and the twist at the end combine  to make this a very satisfying experience. The story creeps under your skin  and stays there long after the movie is over. I was never a fan of Bruce  Willis before, but his performance in this film is perfect and has made me  a fan. Every actor is well-cast, but without Haley Joel Osment the film may  not have been as successful. Writer/diector M. Night Shyamalan found the  just the right person to play this part, and drew out of him the best  performance of his young career. Shyamalan will be the next Spielberg for  sure, as this is the best writing I've encountered in a script in a while.  (It should be, since he was paid over 2 million dollars for it.) His  previous movie, Wide Awake, while not as good as Sixth Sense (or even in  the same vein) is worth watching as well. Do yourself a favor and see The  Sith Sense if you haven't already!	5.0	Quite simply, my favorite movie.	2000-03-28	0	0	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	David Anderson	&quot;I see dead people.&quot;This is the movie's stand-out quote.  It shows M. Night Shamayalan's brilliance as a producer, director, and writer.  He incorporated one of his childhood fantasies into &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and added some of his own ideas giving it a brilliant storyline.  The symbolisms(ex. the color red) give it that added uniqueness.  Shamayalan proves that he'll become the next Steven Spielberg someday.Haley Joel Osment deserved his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role of Cole Sear.  He expresses Sear's fears and trials much better than most other 11-year old actors are capable.  This powerful performance excites many to discover his performances while he's growing up and as an adult.The rest of the cast is amazing: Toni Collette, Bruce Willis, Trevor Morgan, Olivia Williams, etc.  Everybody, including Osment, has that special chemistry amongst one another.  They provoke their emotions into their audience.  When a character fears, the audience fears.  When a character rages, the audience rages.  These define the meaning of &quot;The Sixth Sense's&quot; storyline and environment.  They force the audience think about the story elements rather than revealing them bluntly.  This allows the audience to constantly watch it and learn new elements everytime.  One may constantly whisper to their friends, &quot;I see dead people&quot; due to the movie addiction.	5.0	I love seeing dead people	2003-07-25	0	0	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"Some films are just blessed from their conception through their finished product and ""The Sixth Sense"" is one of those films.  Everything just works to perfection here from the direction, scripting, casting, and the technical attributes.  Director M. Night Shyamalan was totally on his game with this film.  His story works not on just a psychological level but also on a supernatural one.  The film is augmented by the eerie camerawork of Tak Fujimoto that give locations in Philadelphia that I'm familiar with a creepy feel that I otherwise would not attribute to them.  Bruce Willis has never been better as Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist who is recovering from physical as well as psychological wounds.  Haley Joel Osment is a complete revelation as Cole Sear, a troubled youth suffering from the recent divorce of his parents and visions that are inhabiting his imagination.  Toni Collette gives a heatbreaking turn as Cole's mother.  Olivia Williams is also effective as Crowe's wife who he feels distant from because of recent events.  This film is, of course, remembered primarily for it's twist ending which I will not divulge here for the few who haven't seen this film.  This film is so effective that it would work even without it.  In my mind I think Shyamalan was spoiled by the success of this film.  In subsequent films he has has been trying to capture lightning in a jar by succumbing to audience expectations only to disappoint to some degree.  He should realize that what made ""The Sixth Sense"" such a success was good story and good characterization.  He seems to be writing the endings first and then building the story around it.  He should be writing good stories and the endings will come naturally."	5.0	Suspense Classic	2005-02-02	2	1	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1GP0QM4WYTAOS	"David Brehmer ""'I once had a gorgeous shining..."	This movie was nothing more than a cut and paste version of Poltergeist, Ghost and Jacob's Ladder. Some of the scenes were so familiar that you can't help but wonder how someone could have the audacity to keep them in  after the final edit. The first half hour is incredibly slow, and the  special effects were anything but, looking more like a sophomore production  of Sleepy Hollow than a huge budgeted Hollywood effort. I realize that they  were trying for subtlety instead of blood, but they seemed to convey more  apathy than actual sublime proficiency. The ending was surprising, but  after watching it twice I found far too many inconsistencies to make it  plausible (unless you buy the child's excuse that people only see what they  want to.)The acting was very strong, though, and together with the  superb cinematography (Philadelphia never looked better) they are perhaps  the only two reasons to watch. Compare this movie with Jacob's Ladder,  which in my opinion was a much more intricate and profound allegory (plus  truly nightmarish spectres), and decide for yourself.This does deserve  to be watched, intently, but there are much better selections of this theme  to be found.	3.0	Very Unoriginal	2000-04-08	1	0	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A36L1F0YECOAW8	David Grant	One of the few movies I have ever seen that was so respected and admired that no one ever told anyone else what happened at the end. Rare, to say the least. At the heart of this exceptional film is a moving performance by Hollywood action star Bruce Willis (of all people) as a child psychologist trying to help a young boy who seems to be haunted by visions of ghosts. The film unfolds slowly, picking up pace after a half an hour or so and then seems to end all too quickly, with a surprise twist at then end that will leave your jaw hanging on the floor. What director M. Night Shyamalan has done here is nothing short of amazing. An involving, emotional, and frightening film that recalls the days when vile special effects were not needed to terrify the audience. Instead, Shyamalan juxtaposes between subtle visual suggestion and bold, striking images to constantly calm and then shock the viewer and it's a strategy that works beautifully. I have never been so frightened by the turning of a doorknob as I have been during this film. But as terrifying as it is, THE SIXTH SENSE is also a film about loss and redemption and love and it will easily move you to tears. Haley Joel Osment is superb in the role of Cole Sear, the small child haunted for reasons he doesn't fully understand. Child stars like this don't come along very often and here he gives a performance that is both heartbreaking and assuring. His growth in both character and understanding during the course of the movie never seems 'acted'... it is such a strong performance that we believe every word he says even when the characters on the screen beside him don't. He is remarkable. As is Toni Collette as his hard-working mother, a woman at a loss to explain what's happening to her son. But the key performance in the film, the one that sets the story down it's unforgettable path comes from a most unlikely source: ex- New Kids On The Block singer Donnie Wahlberg, who lost a lot of weight to play a bitter and terrified ex-patient of Willis's. It is an amazing bit of acting that not only sets up the story but also defines it. THE SIXTH SENSE is one of the best films of 1999 and deserves a place in your home library.	5.0	A true ghost story told brilliantly.	2001-02-14	3	1	2

Doesn't that just shout out that your dead?  Plus, if I were Bruce Willis's character, I would have figured the whole  thing out when I saw my dead body on the bed!

This is nothing short of an abuse of the DVD format!I will NOT buy  another movie put out by Hollywood Pictures unless they stop this practice.

Night Shyalaman what it is about. he said it was about communication. look at the four central characters and the lack of communication between the two couples. haley joel osmet's character can't communicate with his mother because of fear. what would she think of him if she knew his secret? she is already suspicious that something is wrong.then on the other end is malcom and his wife. we see throughout the movie that their relationship has hit a snag, and it takes the coming together of reclusive doctor and the frightened young boy to bridge the gap of communication between both couples. on this level, the movie is excellent, and this is what m. night shyalaman was attempting to do.everybody should get this movie and watch it for this. enjoy the scary parts too, but this movie is about human relations and communication.	5.0	a pleasant surprise	2000-12-20	4	3	1
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2GLFKM6IBYRP7	Dean Sullivan	The movie is basically about a child psychologist Malcolm Crowe(Bruce Willis)who trys to help a child(Cole Sear played by Haley Joel Osment)with real emotional problems. The first 30 minutes of the movie can seem  slow,leaving the taste of a very good episode of the X-files in the viewers  mouth. However the film really then lunches itself on the audience, when  the child confines in Willis,&quot;I see dead people,&quot;, and the movie  takes off. A true 5 star movie if'll you'll very see one.  Cole Sear,  played by Haley Joel Osment is incredible in the film and should win a  oscar, and so is Willis(who I'm a big fan of). The story is excellent, and  ending the most powerfull for years, it makes you wanna watch it all over  again.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2G0O4Y8QE10AE	Deborah A. Woehr	Sixth Sense beats the Poltergeist series, Ghost Story, and whatever else they came out with in the past twenty years.  The story is set in Philadelphia, the main character (Bruce Willis) a prominent psychiatrist  who just received an award for his achievements.  The spookiness gets off  to a good start when his wife goes down to the cellar to pick a bottle of  wine.  I got the distinct impression that something was down there with  her.  From there, things get really ugly when they find one of his patients  inside their bathroom.  Then the story jumps forward a year.  Willis tries  to help out an embattled little boy, who claims to see ghosts.  The ghosts  themselves didn't make the hair raise up on my neck.  It was the chilling  stories behind their appearances.  Willis becomes consumed by the case at  the expense of his marriage, or so it seems until the very end.  The  conclusion will surprise most of you because the movie's hints are so  subtle that you don't even notice them until it hits you in the face.  I  left the theater thinking, &quot;Why didn't I catch on to that?&quot;  Very  well done.	5.0	An Excellent Movie	2000-05-04	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1ZU731IFILMV4	"Demonic Kelvin ""Dark"""	Overall, this movie brings a quite slow and calm story line with little eerie in it but still, it is good. Among the horror movies I've seen, this one is not considered very horrifying. The thing that capture my attention in this movie is the excellent performence by the young Haley Joel Osment. Despite his age, he managed to act(well, I have to say)extremely well. I kind a amazed by the way he acted. He is so cool and he managed to express his inner feelings, thus making the cold and solemn situation appears in the entire movie. He makes me started to think, how a little kid like him can act so WELL and so REAL? I've never came across any kid that can perform that good and I never expect such excellent perfomence from him. He indeed has very good talent in acting(he's just 11 years old). But still, I must say that the whole story is a little boring and not much intense situation appears in it. Although I said it is quite boring, but there is one part in the movie that I feel is interesting. It is the ending which is a big twist to the entire story. With the message that this movie brings and such outstanding performence by the actors(especially Haley Joel Osment), you won't be suprised that people watch this movie again and again. Even I myself had watched it for times to understand the message it brings and the true essence of this movie. Not bad of a movie.	4.0	Slow, calm, little eerie but GOOD!	2004-10-06	3	1	2

The new extras consist of three documentaries, one on making Sixth Sense, one on the paranormal, supposedly hosted by M. Night, but you mostly hear from William Peter Blatty and the guy who wrote Ghost. Oh, and the third one is an interesting look into how Night uses storyboards to help him in the film making process. These are generally excellent and worth buying the movie over again, especially since you get everything that was on the original version as well. With one notable exception. The segment from Night's first horror film, which I found amusing, is missing. Why oh why are &quot;deluxe&quot; editions put out that don't contain all the extras of the regular edition? Oh well, it's an annoying, yet small oversight. The packaging is superior and the movie looks and sounds great.

You are probably here to find out if it is worth owning on DVD, and let me tell you it certainly is. There is a load of features on this disc, and the best part is the anamorphic widescreen presentation. No letterbox garbage here. One of the features is the first film done by the director when he was a child, along with several trailer and tv spot commericals. The picture is excellent, but as with all quiet dramas, you aren't going to impressed by the sound. Other than that, the Sixth Sense on DVD is a great buy.	5.0	A terrific ghost story within a great DVD	2001-02-28	2	0	2

I was surprised to find my favorite movie, second only to the Godfather. This is one of the sweetest most emotional films I've ever watched because to me, the concept that a small boy could find the courage to face his fears in the very thing he fears most, is beautiful. I enjoyed the performance of the two main actors as well as the music by one of my favorite composers. The twist at the end didnt surprise me but only becuase I was paying very close attention to subtle details in the film. Nevertheless, this movie is a great example of a beautiful story portrayed in an inconventional way.	5.0	very sweet	2005-12-01	1	1	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1AE5GP7DGGYSZ	"Diane, genre fiction & wordplay lover ""diane_d"""	My perspective for my first viewing of this movie was probably not that common: (1) I do believe that ghosts can and do exist (although I'm certainly not someone who believes every &quot;true&quot; ghost story until it's totally disproven), and (2) when I initially heard that it had a total-surprise ending, I proposed what turned out to be the correct plot-twist - 'though I was half-laughing as I said it. Anyway, the point is, I can't comment on the shock-value of the ending revelation, because I personally wasn't shocked; but I can and will comment on the quality and plausibility of the production.As you can see by my 4-star rating, I liked it. I was afraid it might be a gore-fest, full of gross, just-killed-looking ghosts, but that's far from the main theme of the picture. It's about a scared, ostracized little boy, and a troubled man who wants to help him, but isn't sure just what is real. I didn't find the basic premise or the ending TOO ridiculous or far-fetched, but there are still a couple of &quot;iffy&quot; points I wish I could talk over with the makers, asking exactly what they conceived to have been really happening. When I watched the film (on a premium movie channel), there was some commentary from them (the writer and the director(?)) played over the lead-out, which was interesting - I assume it's also included here.Boy, it was difficult to write much without giving any spoilers, but I hope this helped you decide. I have to say that even with my guess in mind as I watched, the first time through I still missed several of the clues that I was right, and I wasn't SURE until well along. It's quite cleverly done.	4.0	Well-done - emotional, not shock-shlock	2001-01-11	3	2	1

Haley Joel Osment is going to be a really good actor if he keeps making movies, which I hope he does.  He is great.  Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis bringing stardom to this already great movie.  It was one of the most unexpected endings that I have ever witnessed.  It was overall, a wonderfully, entertaining, thrill ride that after three times seeing it, I still want to see it.  M. Night Shyamalan would once again prove his brilliance with scary movies with Unbreakable also starring Bruce Willis, and then again with Signs, starring Mel Gibson.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	The Sixth Sense is a rare Hollywood gem that came along in a year full of flop movies such as The Haunting and The Blair Witch Project (not that there is anything wrong with those films; I'm speaking in terms of  popularity). Packing in big crowds and delivering a thrilling a suspenseful  joyride of excitement and talent, director Shyamalan's film is one that  will not soon be forgotten. The story centers on a child psychologist  (Willis) and his mission to help a small child (Osment) that is plagued by  ghostly apparitions. Only they arent' apparitions; they are reality. I  shall stop here, for going on will ruin the rest of this masterpiece. The  ending is, by far, Hollywood's most brilliantly conceived ending to date,  and the suspense leading up to it is well worth the wait. The performances  between Willis and Osment are astounding, and their chemistry as  patient-doctor is well-received by viewers. The chemistry between Toni  Collette and Osment as mother-son was perceived brilliantly by the  director, who also wrote the screenplay. Cinematography and camera moves  each have significant accentuation that set them apart from one another.  Each question or mystery solved is yet another brought up, and the  intensity of each moment is evident. An original work of art, comparable to  The Silence of the Lambs.	5.0	Haunting and very original.	2000-03-29	5	3	2

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1XX5797TIZT5Q	D. Mok	The Sixth Sense starts off with a very dreary, almost purely expository scene that screams out to the audience who the main character is, what's his situation, and what his relationship to his wife is.  When I saw that  scene, I started preparing myself for a movie lacking in slyness, subtlety,  and pacing.I'm glad to say my initial perception was wrong.  Once Haley  Joel Osment enters the picture; once Bruce Willis' character starts on his  course; once the tension sets in, The Sixth Sense begins to pack a wallop.  The gold-standard performances from the three top-billed actors Willis,  Osment and Toni Collette are already enough to make the film dramatically  involving, all three holding back on overemoting and opting for strength  and nuance.  The script is hypnotic, the camerawork carefully considered,  and the final suckerpunch one of the best in cinematic history.  Once you  see it, you can think back and realize how difficult it must've been to set  it up, how many restrictions that placed on scenes involving the  protagonist, and how well it worked.Finally, the greatest triumph of The  Sixth Sense is to bring the supernatural horrors so close to home that they  become normalized.  Osment's reactions to his visions are so real that even  though the film draws from the well of the supernatural thriller, a genre  that's becoming increasingly dated, none of the impact is lost.Another  lesson to the new horror filmmakers who use Scream and Urban Legend as  standards for horror:  It's never &quot;who&quot; did what that terrifies,  but &quot;how&quot;; it's not gore, torture, loud music, car crashes and  weird-shaped weapons, but atmosphere and character identification.	5.0	A true rarity:  A deserving blockbuster.	2000-04-04	2	2	0

Not that the film is &quot;scary&quot; - but its very realistic. You can't help but wonder what could be in another dimension around us, that we just can't see. I have always been a believer in the after-life, and this movie shows such a realistic portrayal of the writers opinion of the spirit world. Haley Joel Osment, who plays the little boy who can see dead people, gives an incredible emotional performance. And this has to be Bruce Willis' finest performance to date. If you are curious about what could be &quot;on the other side&quot; - or even if you have already formed opinions on the afterlife - this movie will hold your attention and make you think.	5.0	Interesting Film on the After-Life	2001-01-07	0	0	0

We munched and crunched and were amazed at the star qualities portrayed by the young fella.  He  certainly deserved an Oscar or honorary award for his outstanding  performance. Toni Collette did a pretty good job with her American accent.  We enjoyed the twist and I must admit, I did not work out what was going on  until the film allowed us to realize it.  The glitch I found was when Bruce  Willis was at the table talking to the little boy.  He had a hair lick  falling off his head and in the next cut to him the hair lick was  conveniently slicked back into place.  I can't believe a film nominated for  an academy award could have such a glaring mistake. Thoroughly enjoyable  nonetheless and watching it a 2nd time around should be worthwhile.	4.0	Amazing thought provoking film - 1 Glitch Found	2000-04-17	5	2	3
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1OBM38R2NOIR7	Doris Morgan	"The Sixth SenseThe Sixth Sense (1997) directed by M. Night Shyamalan, which he wrote and plays the part of Dr. Hill, a psychiatrist, is a timely masterpiece.  The late 90's was a time for increased and renewed spiritually.  Many individuals were and are still seeking answers to what happens after we die.  Shyamalan was born in India where belief in reincarnation is very strong.  While he was born in India he grew up in the United States in Philadelphia.  There is a quality of ""other world ness"" or ""wholly unknown"" that he brings to the screen.  What some have only imagined or ""wholly sensed"" he brings to life on film.  His works include Signs (2002) and currently he is in post production of The Village (2004).  What he and fellow director Jerry Zucker (Ghost, 1990) both portray through the genres of drama, mystery, and thriller is: Unfinished business keeps you around after you die.Unfinished business is what keeps Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist around for a while.  Despite the fact that his grieving wife has not been able to let him completely go- she plays home movies to keep him close, for a while.  Individuals do sense sometimes their loved ones who have passed on are right beside them.  This could be in the role of protector, as in Ghost, where Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) tries to protect his girlfriend Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) from harm, or as a guardian angel.  One theme within both films is that of coming to terms with oneself and to be at peace.  This was accomplished for Sam when he was able to communicate his message through Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), thus saving Molly from certain death.  In The Sixth Sense Crowe feels guilty about not being able to help is de-ranged ex-client.  To do penance for that he tries to help, and succeeds in doing so, Cole.  Cole for his part learns to face his fears, and works with his gift instead of against it.  He helps the dead girl communicate a message to her father about her death.  Through the process Crowe walks with Cole, afterwards he is able to let go, but first he whispers into his wife's ear how much he loves her.What makes this film and others like it so interesting is that our society has within it a sub-culture of those who believe in the supernatural.  The popularity of Crossing Over with Jonathan Edwards attests to this fact, as well as It's a Miracle.  People want answers and will go to almost any length to get them.  Many individuals have testified that they have either sensed or seen deceased family members at one time or another.  The Sixth Sense is a great film for those of us with imagination and also for those without imagination."	5.0	Un-Finished Business	2004-06-02	3	0	3

If so, I'll be very anxious to see what comes next from this talented person.  As far as ""The Sixth Sense"", like most people it caught me, held me, riveted me to  my seat, then surprised the heck out of me.  This is one of those rare  films that, after the ending credits, I wanted to immediately purchase  another ticket and view it again from a different perspective...to see what  I missed and why I didn't catch on as the film progressed (""The Usual  Suspects"" was another film that captured me in the same way).Although  several people didn't care for this movie, and thought it was overhyped and  that Haley Joel Osment overacted (ala a young Ricky Schroeder in  ""Earthling""), I came away with the opposite reaction...and hey, I liked the  ""Earthling"".  However, I can relate to those who didn't like it.  I've  viewed many films that have been highly praised, but left me cold (some of  these films I've viewed again after many years and was surprised to find  out that they were much, much better--or worse--than what I remembered.  I  believe ones' sense of liking or disliking anything depends upon  expectation and what mood he or she is in at the time).  With that said, I  thought ""The Sixth Sense"" did live up to its hype, and was amazed at the  performance of not only Osment, but also Bruce Willis' surprising,  understated performance.  I also enjoyed how the movie sent  honest-to-goodness chills through me, and without the use of gory ""slasher""  scenes that try to shock the audience with its violence.While I don't  believe this is a great film in the ""classic"" sense, I do think that it is  the type of movie that can enlist impromptu discussion around the  proverbial water cooler (ala ""Fargo"").  Between 1 and 10, ""The Sixth Sense""  deserves a solid 8, and it's a film that I am anxious to see again."	4.0	Creative, eerie script.	2000-03-18	2	2	0

The first time i saw it in theatres i was scared to look under my bed that night :) Now the effect has worn off, but i still love watching the movie. There is a lot of suspense, and the acting  was superb.There are quite a few extra features for this DVD. I found  the deleted scence section to be very entertaining. Its neat to see what  has been cut from a movie. Another feature I liked was one were the  director showed one of his early attempts as a youngster at making a scary  movie. Most DVD's don't have a feature like that, so I thought it was very  creative.If you liked what you saw it the theatres, I'm sure you will  like this DVD, its definetly worth picking up.	5.0	Love the extra features on this DVD	2000-05-20	1	0	1

It's a wild rollercoaster ride from beginning to end. The tension mounts slowly but surely, and it's pretty much a  supernatural sleuthing masterpiece, where when you watch it the second time  round, you realize you had missed out some things out in the first viewing.  It is not just another run-of-the-mill ghost story, believe me. This one  you must see to believe.	5.0	An essential for a collection.	2000-06-07	6	4	2

Near the end, I was running what I had  seen through my mind, and I was saying to myself that this was a pretty  good 'Bruce Willis' film, but not great - then the suprise hit me like a  ton of bricks in the face!  The whole theater let out a collective 'oh!'  and the film immediately went from 'Pretty Good' to 'Excellent'.  If you  have not seen the film, do not ask anybody about it, just see it.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1SGOBOYHHEMS6	El Carajo	Shame on you, M. Night Shyamalan; five senses are enough for me.  It is generally considered an asset for a movie to make its audience identify with its characters.  Ironically, The Sixth Sense manages to turn this  identification effect into a liability.  106 minutes of this soporific  snack and I felt myself among its ambulant spirits, mortally wounded and  too bored to die.  I'm not sure if any &quot;suprise&quot; ending could  have resurrected such a corpse, especially not one that is all but dictated  to the viewer in the first five minutes.  This twist is so predictable that  the movie defaults on its already meager build.  In trying to create a  mellifluous thriller, Shyamalan has instead concocted a metaphysics of  melodrama where the stiffs embody the movie's false and tawdry animism.  But at least the actors are easy to make fun of.  Bruce Willis portrays his  character like a doped-out android, and Osment, in trying to prove his  character is not a freak, delivers his lines with the cadences of a nubile  chimpanzee.  All the ink spilled and all the hype spouted over this film  bespeaks the paltry condition of American sensibilities.  Buy this film and  relish it, but you may have to answer for it in the hereafter.	1.0	Is There Death After Life?	2000-04-15	12	7	5

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4	Elisabeth	The first time I saw this movie, I immediately watched it a second time.  If you've seen the shocker of the ending, then you know why.  When I watched it the second time around, it was like watching a completely different movie.  This is a very tricky stunt to pull off, but I think director M. Night Shyamalan pulls it off perfectly.I watched the DVD extras where the director said he was concerned that midway through the movie, a specific scene might've given away the ending.  Not at all!  At least not for me.  I was completely shocked at how the movie ended...in a good way.I should note that this is a slow-moving movie.  I saw this movie with my dad who prefers high action movies with lots of explosions, so he fell asleep halfway through this movie.The first two times I saw this movie, the slow-moving nature of it didn't bother me.  I was too fascinated by the storyline to be bored.  I also liked the symbolism throughout (that I didn't catch until I saw the DVD extras) like the red door knob, the red balloon, etc...  Great little tricks in this movie that are fun to try and find.I also like the surprise shots, like in the kitchen when the cupboards are all open and in the tent.However, on my third viewing of this movie, I did think the dialogue could've been sped up a bit.	5.0	The second viewing is like watching a completely different movie	2010-04-05	9	2	7

No NOTHIN' to insult the viewer's intelligence or embarrass the cast and crew. Pure and simple: the best horror film of the 90s, and the most moving and transcendent horror film in many, many years. Hell, maybe ever. Somewhere, Val Lewton, Montague James and Ambrose Bierce are looking down, beaming with pride. If you're not choking back an honestly-earned sob by the film's end, please resign from the human race. And this from someone who, having read 'An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge' as a child, saw the snap ending coming very early on. Doesn't matter: masterpiece.	5.0	Transcendent Horror	2001-10-27	2	2	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2EB7NEJEI2PS4	"""elyjar"""	I was a little sceptical at first about watching a movie that deals mainly with themes that involve issues like life after death, ghosts and the supernatural. Unlike it's predesessors 'The Exorcist' and 'Omen'(which also featured a boy), &quot;The sixth sense&quot; is a much  more intense and  powerful movie, both emotionally and psychologically.The affliction and  pain that Osment brings to the screen is so overwhelming and powerful, it's  scary to  think where all that talent comes from, more so than all the  creepy scenes in the movie put together.While the few sentimental  scenes between Cole(Osment) and his mother(Toni Collette) are simply  priceless, the show stopper is definately the 'knock your socks off' ending  to the movie. The punch the final scene delivers will simply blow you away  and  leave you with an emotional and psychological baggage for days after  watching the movie. I saw the movie when it was originally released in the  cinemas and as I drove home late that night , I could swear I heard a knock  on my rear windscreen. My heart  literally stopped as I slammed down on the  brakes. That's how much the movie affected me.I can't begin to imagine  how talented Osment is and what a star he will become. His screen presence  and emotions eminates from his acting to the audience, even moving some to  tears. As for director M. Night shyamalan, I can't say enough about his  great directing and screenplay. His craftsmanship and meticulous attention  to subtleties will amaze even the harshest critics.And the best thing  about the movie? The fact that you can go back after watching it the first  time, and see all the events and moments in the movie that have enabled the  greatest audience deception in movie-making history!5 stars for the best  of 1999!	5.0	Wins my vote for best movie of 1999 hands down!	2000-05-02	5	4	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A228NBNLYJ8V3J	Eran Cohen	The sixth sense is a remarkable and distinct movie. See it once, maybe twice - but no more.  Most of you have probably seen it on the silver screen, considering now to buy the DVD version - don't. The depreciation of this movie is significant because of the finale; after seeing it once, feeling the excitement and suspense of the first view, a second look is far less thrilling or enjoying, for that matter.This difference is so clear that I truly advise to save some buck, and rent it, or buy the VHS version. Understand , most of its magic is gone once you know what it's all about. You may pay attention to things you've missed, and enjoy the overall experience again in a different way, but once you have - you wouldn't want to see it again (to prove my point is the majority's, look how many used DVDs are offered for sale).	4.0	Great movie , but . . .	2001-08-18	0	0	0

This movie was top notch and except for one flaw on the DVD release, one that's more than  painfully aperrant in the other reviews, is worth every penny. My original  review blasted the DVD releases ultra-annoying previews. I seem to be one  of the lucky ones who can skip past them, one at a time, to get to the  movie. It takes a few clicks and less than a minute, but this is not really  the point. I stopped buying video because of mindless fat at the beginning,  not just previews to bad films, but also the even more annoying commercials  for products relating very little, if at all, to the movie or to movies in  general. Add to this the fact that it's a COLLECTOR'S edition and I was  fairly outraged. I really think that I would stop buying DVD altogether if  this became the norm, just as I did with video. That's how much I love film  and hate video. The movie is wonderful, A true work of film art that should  be honored. The DVD is passable, and those responsible for it's poor  execution should be chided.	3.0	For Shame (Revisited)	2000-04-17	8	3	5

The first time you watch this movie you'll be drawn into the characters; especially the young boy as he tries to come to grips with the  special gift that he has.Bruce Willis puts on one of his best  performances to date as a child psychologist having sever marital problems  in the midst of trying to help the distraught child.The Sixth Sense is  going to take you on a roller coaster.  One moment you'll feel love,  despair, shock, happiness and then fear as the plot offers more twists and  turns that a labyrinth.You'll be shocked at the ending of this one as it  comes from out of left field... or does it?  Watch the movie again for a  second time and you'll pick up on things that should have given the ending  away, but were so subtle that they didn't.I enjoyed this movie a lot  more the second time I watched it.  Suggested for mature youngsters and all  adults.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1CHM200OEN65X	"Eric Wilson ""novelist"""	&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; appeals to that oft-neglected human sense in Hollywood films...the sense of taste and style.  Utilizing single position camera angles, terrors hinted at rather than splashed across the screen,  and understated acting, this movie raises questions and fears without  shoving them in your face.  When I first saw it, I said that Cole's mother  should get an Oscar nod for her gut-wrenching role.  I'm glad to see she  has. When I first saw the film, it was the same week that Kip Kinkel's  interviews had been released.  This brought to the forefront the reality  that there is another realm that pushes kids and adults toward unwise  choices.  Kinkel said he heard voices.  Unfortunately, &quot;The Sixth  Sense&quot; erases its own valid questions by slopping a tidy solution  across the last half hour:  Just listen to the voices; they just need your  help...Well, that's not always true.  Only one Divine voice offers reliable  direction--but that one's difficult to hear through all the other noise.  Overall, this movie's technical aspects impressed me--and yes, the ending  caught me off-guard.  Worth the viewing, just don't buy into its every  message.	4.0	Listen to the Voices?	2000-03-09	22	11	11
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A84UFSF2SZS2W	"EriKa ""E"""	Was this film a surprise? Was the ending a surprise really? Personally I felt, as I watched the film, that there was something missing. Certainly a real dialogue between all other characters but Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis was missing, but that was not blatantly obvious. Willis's oblivious behaviour toward his wife also left some unanswered questions. How is it that he could really not know he was dead if there were all these things going on in his wife's life that he knew nothing about? (She was taking antidepressants, was starting to see other people)? I suppose it is possible to be living with someone who becomes virtually a stranger to you as circumstances change. However, the most obvious problem was simply that there was no real segu&eacute; into his life after he had been shot. We see no ambulances, no recovery, nothing. This always makes me suspicious. We just see him lying there bleeding, and the next thing we know he is meeting a little boy. How would he have time, after all, to devote all this time to one case if he were indeed alive? Also Haley Joel Osment probably does not choose to tell Willis he sees dead people because Willis is his counselor but because Willis manages to make contact and communicate with him, unlike all the other dead people who have just scared him.  I guess I felt prepared for the ending only because I have seen similar things. For example, in Jacob's Ladder, with Tim Robbins, his character hallucinates an entire life after Vietnam, but it turns out that he never left Vietnam. He died in combat. Granted, The Sixth Sense was superior with its story, its stylistics and its suspense. Perhaps it appears that I am complaining, but far from it. Willis's performance was understated and skillful. I am not a fan of Haley Joel Osment, but his performance was commendable, particularly for someone of his age. I was highly impressed also with Australian actress Toni Collette as Osment's frustrated but loving and protective mother. The Sixth Sense had clues in it, but it was not clear-cut. It was not obvious how it would end. It was well crafted, suspenseful, and completely unexpected in the cinema when it appeared... unexpected but welcome.	4.0	EERIE	2001-11-04	8	1	7
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2D8CUJPOSRPNA	Erik North	In my humble opinion, THE SIXTH SENSE was the last great horror movie of the cinema in the 20th century.I say this for a number of reasons.  First of all, writer/director M. Night Shayamalan must be credited with having made a horror film that is genuinely frightening and unsettling without resorting to undue blood, gore, or nudity (thus the 'PG-13' rating).  Second, his handling of the relationship between psychologist Malcolm Crow (Bruce Willis) and the troubled boy Cole Seer (Haley Joel Osment) is one of the more psychologically satistfying things I've seen in the cinema in years.  Third, and last (but not least), is the twist ending that occurs--and, contrary to what anyone else might believe, I did NOT see it coming.  This twist is perhaps the greatest sting-in-the-tail ending the cinema had seen since the coda of the original PLANET OF THE APES in 1968.  I have the feeling that Rod Serling, no stranger to sting-in-the-tail endings (see &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and APES), would have found a lot to admire about THE SIXTH SENSE.Shayamalan weaves elements of such great horror movies as CARRIE, THE SHINING, and POLTERGEIST into his film; and yet, THE SIXTH SENSE does not seem too terribly derivative--it's paying homage.  Willis and Osment, as well as Toni Collette's performance as Osment's equally troubled mother, are at the center of this intriguing thriller.  If you missed it in the theater, try not to miss it on VHS or DVD.  See it; you won't be sorry that you did.	5.0	Seeing dead people	2001-08-11	6	5	1

I first approached Sixth Sense only as a welcome relief from movies saturated with gratuitous sex and Hollywood match-making. Was I pleasantly surprised!  The movie had such a fantastic plot and character dynamics, it was gripping from the beginning.  Even stoic macho men are curious to find out how he little Ghost Watcher will be cured of his problem.  The twist at the end comes unexpectedly and suddenly!  It's worked very well into the fabric of the story and only someone who knows the secret can see the hints throughout the film (at which point they seem almost blatantly obvious!)As a DVD, the included extras add a great deal of depth to the movie and increased my respect for the director and writer, M. Night Shyamalan.  I eagerly await his next creation.	5.0	Let's Twist Again!	2000-10-01	1	1	0

Young	There are so many positives for the Sixth Sense that it's hard to go into all of them in detail, but I'd like to at least share my favorite areas.First and foremost was the way the filmmakers stuck to the rules they set up for the universe. There were no cheap gimmicks or shortcuts taken and there was a lot of attention to the details of each scene.If you're like me, then the ending of the movie came as a surprise. It was not as surprising as the ending to Perfect Blue, but suspenseful nonetheless.Perhaps the best part is the fact that this is really a movie that screams to be watched twice, just so you can go back and scrutinize every scene and detail to see what you missed. There's always something new to discover in the viewing.For all these reasons, I give the movie a solid five stars. One of the best of the year.	5.0	A film to watch again and again.	2000-10-24	2	2	0

He is beginning to see things that are there, but aren't there to people who still exist. They're all dead. This is known to Cole as the Sixth sense. For him, he just wants to get rid of it, so he'll have to just talk it out with them. They just want to talk. Maybe it just might help him, and them.I loved this movie. I didn't understand it at first and thought it was going to be terrible, but turned out to be one of the best scary movies I have ever seen. I jumped about 3 feet in the air when the little boy said, &quot;Come on, I'll show you where my Dad keeps his gun&quot; and the back of his head was blown off. Amazing. Sometimes you don't need special effects to make a scary movie. 5 stars!	5.0	Having a sixth sense can be a blessing or a curse.	2004-04-19	2	1	1
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AD5K7ZWB85GH8	Evgen CAFUTA	The movie is basically about a child psychologist Malcolm Crowe(Bruce Willis)who trys to help a child(Cole Sear played by Haley Joel Osment)with real emotional problems. The first 30 minutes of the movie can seem  slow,leaving the taste of a very good episode of the X-files in the viewers  mouth. However the film really then lunches itself on the audience, when  the child confines in Willis,&quot;I see dead people,&quot;, and the movie  takes off. A true 5 star movie if'll you'll very see one. Cole Sear, played  by Haley Joel Osment is incredible in the film and should win a oscar, and  so is Willis(who I'm a big fan of). The story is excellent, and ending the  most powerfull for years, it makes you wanna watch it all over again. This  movie is a modern classic, and should be bought on DVD, showing off all its  grace.  I hope someone will found this review helpful.	5.0	I heard a sound of silence	2000-02-19	3	2	1

Lucky for Bruce Willes to come along and help!!  Mr.  Wills tryes to tell him why schooling is important, but the boy is scaring - he looks like he is in an acting class pretend at least three times!  The main learning of the movie is that the boy is sad because his pictures have balls of light in them.  The mother sees the balls of light and the scaredeness so she can help.  They decide to stay in school for the boy's best health, and he becomes popular again!!!  I think it's a good message about learning and being friendships, and scary, but not too much, except for Mr. Wills.  He is mad at his wife because he died - a tricky surprise!!!

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1BU1FY4HXN802	"""ferretclaw"""	A rather annoying display of stupidity is very common among Amazon reviewers. They are often inclined to reveal far too much information, ruining it for the rest of us. The Sixth Sense is a movie that's surprise ending could ultimately be decimated by a single careless reviewer. Fortunately, few of this movie's reviewers are dumb enough to blatantly reveal the ending, but some came precariously close to it. This widely acclaimed phsycological, supernatural, etc. thriller, as it has been called, is really a movie about faith. Although it is designed for people of philosophic values, it also uses suspense and chilling sequences to attract a wide range of viewers. If you are the kind of person who watches a movie and takes the whole thing literally, you can enjoy it but not even begin to grasp the subtle, hidden values about life, afterlife and making choices. I previously stated the movie was about faith. And it is. Not any specific faith or religion, but faith in your self as well. It could be enterpreted many ways. Here is how I interpreted it: The Sixth Sense seperates all people into to classes; those with faith and those without. Those with faith usually come out strong in times of crisis. This is also the underlying theme in Shamalyan's other film, Signs. I was dissapointed that the other reviewers seemingly failed to grasp the movie's underlying values. But now maybe you will. And if you like the Sixth Sense, I'd advise you against buying the Others, as it is a cheap rip-off of the Sixth Sense without the subtle messages. And watch out for them poor, misguided reviewers.	5.0	Watch it until you really understand it	2003-05-24	12	8	4
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2HIWDD2TDXS19	F. Gentile	"There's a zillion reviews of this film, & every opinion has been expressed (except MINE !) So, here goes. I felt this was one of the better movies I've seen in a long, long time. It is rare to find a ""scary"" movie that actually does just that. That's because it takes psychological manipulation of an audience, not just screeching jumping creatures or oodles of blood. This is a unique story, uniquely told. Many films promise a ""twist"", that'll  ""knock you off your feet""...etc, and you usually end up saying ""THAT""S the big surprise ??"" (Like you didn't know immediatley that the character in ""The Crying Game"" was really a man... HELLO ???) But, I must say, this film really delivers. I am, admittedly, usually prejudiced (sometimes unfairly so) against newer flicks as, they are more often than not, dissapointments. This film took me totally by surprise. Not only is the acting great, but the subtle unfolding of the story has just the right pacing and rhythym  to make the hairs stand up on your neck. Haley Joel Osmet is a wonder as ""Cole"", the little boy being tortured by his secret. His performance is the main reason this film is so credible. And, though I always felt that Bruce Willis had a quality that made him stand out above most of his contemporaries, his performance in this film, as the psychologist who seems to need to help himself through helping this troubled little boy,  is filled with depth, he is simply terrific. And I found the actress who played ""Coles"" mom, to be very effective at portraying the stressed out single mom, who needs two jobs to support her son, doesn't know how to help her little boy,  (and, has bad taste in clothes.) While I did figure out the ""twist"" of the film about half way through, it wasn't because I'm so brilliant. It was because of something that the little boy said, that I was really just half listening to, but it struck me a moment later, when I said out loud in the theater ""I know what the secret is !!"", whereupon my companion told me to shut the hell up. I've just watched this film again, and it is just as powerful, moving, and chilling as on the first viewing. The fact that you know the plot twist from the initial viewing in no way takes away from the feeling of having had the rug pulled out from under you. People get different reactions from the same film, that's what makes an ""opinion"" an opinion. But I'm not one of those who says things like ""that film you just saw was in actuality NOT about Becky Sues & Billy Bobs tumultuous love life, in reality, that was a metaphor for the Arab-Israeli conflict..."" Call me shallow, but I like to be swept up in the experience of what I'm actually seeing. This film totally succeeds, not only in entertaining you, but in making you think, scaring the heck out of you, and moving you emotionally. Several films tried to incorporate the special plot twist that this film originated, but, for me, they fell flat. (See: (or don't) ""The Others"".) I feel this film, with its deft direction, and fine cast,  will stand the test of time, and become a classic. As stated...Just darn excellent !"	5.0	Just Darn Excellent.	2002-07-14	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3CWH6VKCTJAD	"""flickjunkie"""	It seems most people fall into one of two camps on this film. They either love it or hate it (it would seem that more love it). My sentiments lie with neither camp. This is a fascinating and clever story that is well  filmed but poorly crafted. Plot holes abound and Director/Writer M. Night  Shyamalan has to fudge all over the place to keep the surprise ending a  surprise. In my comments here, I have commented many times on the dangers  of writers directing their own work. In almost every case, the director  lacks the necessary objectivity to identify and excise plot flaws. In this  case they were glaring.So, I have a fundamental problem calling this a  great motion picture. However, it was very well filmed from a technical  standpoint and produced some excellent suspense throughout that kept the  viewer engaged.The acting was fair to excellent. Toni Collette was  mediocre at best as Cole's mother. She overacted in almost every scene and  her chemistry wasn't very good with the boy until the last scene when he  told her what her mother said. Likewise, Olivia Williams didn't bowl me  over as Malcolm's wife.Bruce Willis gave a good performance, but he is  out of his element playing the sensitive and self doubting type. He always  comes across as a bit whiny when he tries to play nice guy parts. His forte  is playing the tough, strong courageous type and he would best serve his  career by staying with those types of parts.Finally, there is young  Haley Joel Osment as Cole. He gave an excellent performance and was the  linchpin that held the whole film together. He was very versatile in his  portrayal of various emotions. He handled fear, playfulness, affection and  anger with equal aplomb. His physiognomy was right for the part as well, as  he looked very nerdy and self conscious, exactly what was needed for the  part.I rated this film a 7/10. It was entertaining and it had real  potential, but it was forced to be overly contrived and had too many flaws.	4.0	Clever story with too many holes	2000-04-19	3	2	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2C7BOQVFH1HLE	Frederick Baptist	"This is one of my all-time favourite movies for a number of reasons and it's nice to see that even after a decade, this film ages so well and is still fun to watch.  I watched ""Silence of the Lambs"" again recently and it hasn't aged as well for me.  ""The Sixth Sense"" is more than just a scary movie as it has themes of redemption in trying to make things right, the difficulty of single parenthood and the tremendous impact it has on the innocent child's life both then and in the future and of course the obvious life after death/spirit world issues.  The unexpected twist is a key reason for what makes this film work so well and yet unlike ""Silence ..."" even when you know the ending, the excellent treatment of the various other themes mentioned earlier makes it still watchable.  With ""Silence ..."" I get the feeling I already know the final score of the basketball game and so a massive amount of future enjoyment value is lost with repeated viewings.  Each time I watch ""The Sixth Sense"" though, I still find myself rediscovering elements that I'd somehow missed earlier.  This film like a true classic rewards repeated viewings very well.This Collector's Edition dvd is also a treat as it comes in very good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound quality and the picture quality is for the most part very good.  The Special Features includes very good making-of documentary, deleted scenes and interviews with the cast and especially with the director/screenwriter himself.  As far as standard format discs go this is very good and it only makes me wonder how much better the Blu-ray version can possibly be.  Just like the child character in the film, the inability of adults to take the insights of children seriously enough is the only way I can explain why Haley Joel Osment didn't get the best actor Oscar for his performance here.  I guess he's just too young for the academy to take him seriously?  Bruce Willis has done some of his best work on this film too.  Classic films like this are a one off and it's unlikely M. Night will reach the same heights of quality as he does here again although he does come close with ""Unbreakable.""This is an excellent film that ages well and should be in every film-buff's library.Highly recommended!"	5.0	Ten Years After and Still A Great Movie!	2009-08-22	4	4	0

It's the story of a troubled little boy (Osment) and his psychologist (Willis). It's a bit of a creepy and suspenseful movie, if you can get caught up in the story. Try, it's worth it. Personally, I have a lot of problems with stories that go into such subjects as ghosts, seeing the dead and most things having to do with the supernatural and sixth senses. Okay, having said this, I still find ""The Sixth Sense"" to be an engaging and interesting movie. Here and there it's startling and, here and there it has great emotional impact. It's the kind of movie that makes me wish I could drift off into the supernatural realm as so many other people are freely able to  do.The movie is very well done in every way. Actor Osment is convincing as a troubled little boy. He comes across as real, not some talented child actor. Willis is excellent also, but I have come to expect that of him. I might add that it's  good to see him in a PG-rated movie now and then. All of the supporting cast are excellent. The direction, the filming, the musical background and everything else is first rate and I couldn't help but wondering if the movie hadn't received any awards, but I haven't looked it up. No matter, it just caused me to wonder. The movie lost me again and again because of my inability to go along with the supernatural explanations, but then if repeatedly grabbed me back and the somewhat surprising  ending shook me up. It was an engaging, thought provoking and even somewhat thrilling movie. Relax and enjoy it, if you can.Gary Peterson"	5.0	Very Well Done Movie. Engaging, Interesting, Startling.	2013-03-26	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A31O7B59DW7OHR	Gene Bromberg	Why don't they make good scary movies anymore? Sure, there have been a few  great horror/suspense movies made in the last 10 years or so, but they've  been buried underneath a mass of horrible movies that passed themselves off  as scary. I blame the special effects people. They've gotten so good at  mimicking dismemberment and other nasty things that filmmakers have forgone  suspense for the slaughterhouse. They forget that suspense and terror are  created as much in the mind of the viewer as on the screen. These movies  don't let us think, probably because they don't trust us to.&quot;The  Sixth Sense&quot; is a movie that lets us exercise the 'ol bean while  getting good and scared in the bargain. The plot is so well-known that it  needs little description. A psychiatrist (Willis) treats a young boy  (Osment) who, as the films signature line states, &quot;sees dead  people&quot;. What to do with such a child, who otherwise seems normal,  intelligent, and aware that what's he's saying makes no sense to anyone.  What to do except believe him?It's odd to call a scary suspense movie a  kind movie, but this movie is not, ultimately, about horror. It's about  horrible things, but it's actually a kind, quiet movie, which I think is a  big part of its appeal. That and the surprise ending, of course. Much has  been made of the huge plot twist at the end that had people going to see it  3 or 4 times, just so they could see the movie knowing what the ending was.  I can see why. I won't spoil it by telling you what it is, of course, but I  will say with some smugness that I figured it out with about 30 minutes  left. But...I'll admit that if I hadn't read in reviews that there WAS a big  twist at the end, I never would've guessed it. It is simple and perfect and  absolutely necessary for the film to end as it must.The acting is as  spare and quiet and excellent as the film deserves. I don't know who Bruce  Willis' agent is, but if his client is capable of this kind of work than  why does he end up in all those crappy movies year after year. And Osment  was definitely deserving of his Oscar nomination. So many child actors try  to act like little adults, or they act like ridiculous cartoon kids. Osment  shows the quicksilver intelligence as well as the vulnerability of children  with astonishing skill. The last scene he appears in, when he and Willis  say goodbye, is exceptional, the more so after a second viewing.&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is the biggest grossing suspense movie of  all time, so maybe there's hope for we filmgoers after all. And if Mr.  Shyamalan keeps making movies like this, we all have a lot to look forward  to.	5.0	A scary and smart movie	2000-09-04	2	1	1

However, even if someone sees this movie for the first time, I think they will be pleasantly surprised by how good it is.This movie has all the elements of a perfect movie: great character development, suspense, great acting, and an excellent story line.	5.0	This movie has everything	2004-09-24	1	1	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A15WYLMCI9KILX	Geoffrey S. Robinson	I'm not going to review the movie, because if you are buying this I'm  going to assume you've already seen the movie.  I do want to comment on the  extraordinary quality of the DVD.  Most DVDs I've rented or bought are  horrible, except for the quality of the movie.  The companies just jam it  on a disk.  This disk is has high production values.  When you go to the  menu, it even has an errie visual and music.  The deleted scenes are  wonderful.  The director is taking you into the editing process of the  film. I agree with the director's decisions to delete the scenes he did,  but they are also wonderful.  The rules and clues, which I believe are also  on the video, are also wonderful.  The director seems to genuinely be a  happy man who likes his fans.A big negative is that Buena Vista makes  you watch previews for other films.  Fortunately, you can skip over them.  It is really annoying and I'm tired of living in a culture in which culture  is advertising.	5.0	DVD version is wonderful	2000-08-01	8	6	2

What a wonderful little actor this boy is! His fear  is so real, so palpable, your belief in him is total. An exceedingly well  crafted and written film; with an intelligent script.Bruce Willis is fast  proving to be an excellent actor, not just a fast action hero.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3LH77PBDFEO3F	"G. E. Williams ""Nunah"""	"I saw this originally at the movies, and was amazed at the incredibly believable performance by young Haley Joel Osment who plays a child terrified for too long on the verge of losing his fragile young mind. Just before the end of the story I was very frustrated feeling that the Director had cheated on the mystery of the story, until it did actually end, then of course it was ""Oh, I see!"", my wife who left at the beginning to call the kids at home was very angry, and feeling cheated until I explained it to her.Later when we got to see this on DVD and saw the extra features that let you see how the director not only didn't cheat you, but gave a clue in every scene, I almost felt dumb for not getting it in the first place.Now, I would like to address some of the other criticism leveled at this film; specifically that only Cole's character is three dimensional. The story is Cole's story; the other major characters are unaware of anything that is going on in Cole's story, so for them to be full fleshed as it were would take away from the actual story line, and take you away from the destination of the plot.Now one last thing, I am glad that I saw the screen version first, to have the gotcha moment in the end, but I do prefer the longest directors cut for all subsequent viewings, and we in my house have watched it many times."	5.0	Why I love this movie	2008-07-06	5	3	2

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2P98XL7RXQF93	Gil	&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is an odd movie in today's multi-million-dollar mechanical-effects-laden shoot 'em ups, as it sets a slower, more thoughful pace and rewards those who can slow down long enough  to notice with a chilling story of death, and life beyond it. As such, it  is not the movie of choice for the average chronically-overstimulated,  caffeine-driven consumer. On the other hand, if you have a couple of hours  to allow yourself to be woven into the fabric of this little story, you'll  experience a film that almost universally sends its audience  retrospectively through the details of the plot, looking for the one minor  flaw which causes the premise to collapse like a deck of cards. I know I  did, and I was delighted to find that all loopholes appear closed, and all  conflicts seem resolved -- a sure sign that the screenwriter combed through  this script many times before heading off to market. I appreciated that  sense of craftsmanship, and look forward to seeing this one again.But,  if you gravitate more to the &quot;She's The One&quot; or &quot;Varsity  Blues&quot; market, you will likely find this movie maddeningly slow, like  reading a book for which a movie has already been produced. In such cases,  the remainder of Bruce Willis's body of work will likely interest you more;  however, this one (for me) stands head and shoulders above the rest.	4.0	Not for the Chronically Overstimulated	2000-01-26	1	1	0

I went to see it at the cinema with my husband when it first came out, and to tell you the truth I wasn't expecting much. My husband is a big fan of Bruce Willis and always wants to see his movies. I was expecting another &quot;Die Hard&quot; type action film, but WOW, was I ever wrong. I was glued to my seat the whole time. And not once, did I ever suspect how it was going to end. How was it possible not to guess? But I never, and it amazed me...I was in tears by the time the credits rolled, as most others in the cinema were. This is such a brilliant film, that everybody should see it at least once.

Well, that`s the problem, this movie works nicely on the first viewing, but I don`t really feel the need to watch it again. It`s not very engaging, moves too slowly and if it wasn`t for the final twist it would be quickly forgotten. Ok, the cinematography is alright, the acting good and the mood adequate, but there are a couple of plot inconsistencies and during the most part I was just waiting for something to happen.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	ASZGMRMYAW473	Grant Wise	As you watch little Haley Joel Osment mutter that he sees 'Dead People' you wonder what kind of tale you're going to get into, could this be horror, psychological drama or what. As things start off, it leaves you  very mixed about what is going on, the start is action packed - but you  have little idea of why.When I watched this film, I got to a point in  the story where I wasn't sure what exactly the film was trying to achieve.  It was as if it had the potential to go somewhere - but wasn't quite doing  it. There were seemingly so many areas that didn't fit - or didn't make  sense, but the ending is where that is cleared up and much more.The  ending has to be seen to be believed, it leaves you gasping with amazment  as you realise what you'd been seeing was not really what was happening in  the film - it was basically a distorted view of the lead character - Bruce  Willis. The thing that makes this movie such a hit is the way it leaves you  open mouthed and shocked at the twist at the end, with no prior warning the  film leaves you with multiple unanswered questions, and clears up the  scraps from earlier on. Is this not what a good movie should do?Away  from the storyline, the acting is brilliant, Bruce Willis is the major  character actor here, but supporting performances from the little Osment  and the supporting cast are first rate. The way Osment manages to portray  an emotional scene in the car with his on screen mother makes you wonder  just how much talent this little boy has.This movie doesn't appeal to  one SECTOR of the fim audience as so many movies do. You don't have to like  a particular style of movie to enjoy this, as it panders to all needs. A  rare movie that is universally popular, and you don't need to sit there  thinking before watching this movie 'Will this be my type of movie' it  will.The only possible shortfall of the movie is that it stutters along  a times, trying to mask the holes that would inevitably appear due to the  knowledge you lack as a viewer, before all is explained in the end. But  this can easily be over-looked, as you are left feeling as if you have just  exited that all too enjoyable movie rollercoater.	4.0	Sixth Sense.....but 1st Choice!	2000-07-22	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3S738GO35SH0W	Greg Hughes	My sister took me to see &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; last November. At first I had no idea of what the film was about, or even that it was a horror film until we went into the cinema. That was when I was told it was  about a boy who could see dead people. Without exaggeration,this was the  first time a film actually made the back of my neck tingle.A  nine-year-old boy named Cole attracts the attention of Malcolm Crowe, a  child therapist played by Bruce Willis. Malcolm is drawn to this boy  because he reminds him of one of his old patients - a patient who was  driven to breaking point and committed suicide.Cole tells Malcolm the  same things as the old patient. He is able to see, hear and speak to dead  people.This story initially made me think of Stephen King's novel  &quot;The Shining&quot;, which was also about a young boy who had visions.  &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is a bit more intense. At completely unexpected  moments &quot;visitors&quot; come and go, sometimes silent, at other times  taunting and malicious. Naturally, trying to talk about this to other  people would have them thinking Cole  was either lying or disturbed. The  only person Cole can turn to is Malcolm.It makes you wonder how common  Cole's &quot;sixth sense&quot; really is. Is it a gift or a curse? Were so  many other people who were labelled as &quot;schizophrenic&quot; really  just people like Cole who couldn't make others believe them? These are some  of the film's little subtleties.Horror films work best when there is  little gore to be seen. &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is one of them. Music  seems to work better, especially when there are only fleeting glances of  the ghosts. This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time.	5.0	A Geniune Chiller	2000-02-20	18	14	4
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3LU79BYMWZEW9	Gregor von Kallahann	I found this movie to be very clever and oddly moving.  I can't really say it's a masterpiece, however.  As a night's entertainment, it can't be beat.  And it really is a film that demands at least two viewings (once to  experience it, and once to check out the clues and to make sure that it  really holds together).  Judging from some viewers comments, both on Amazon  and elsewhere, there's a contingent out there that loves nothing better  than to view this film again and again, preferably with a  &quot;first-timer&quot; along for the ride.  I can see that, but for me  there's definitely a limit to the number of times I'd ever want to view  this flick. I'm sure I'll watch &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; a time or two  more in my life, but after viewing it twice already, I'm not in any  enormous rush to see dead people again.	4.0	Very good indeed...	2000-08-08	0	0	0

There have been many &quot;ghost&quot; movies out, but few of them have really been worth seeing. This movie, however, is great in every  aspect! The plot is excellent, and full of twists you'll never see coming.  The acting is simply incredible- Haley Joel Osment is incredible in his  portayal of a small boy named Cole Sear who is haunted by spirits of the  dead. Bruce Willis is really believable in his part portraying a child  psychologist with serious problems of his own. The cinematography and  excellent plot come together to create an eerie, ghastly experience-  without very much blood or gore.Now- for some about the story. I don't  want to give away too much, because most of the enjoyment from the movie  comes from the plot. Basically, Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist with a  life in turmoil, becomes determined to help a small boy who says he  &quot;Sees dead people.&quot; Haunting memories from the past drive  Malcolm's ambition, making him all the more set in his cause. Little Cole  Sear, the disturbed child, is very strange and mysterious- he seems just a  little too knowledgeable for his age. Malcolm thinks that he understand's  Cole's problem, but perhaps, in the end, it is Cole who has something to  teach Malcolm...	5.0	A Creepy But Exhilerating Ride!	2000-06-18	0	0	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A27R8TD3K6JJ47	"""gsgold"""	So, I knew the surprise ending almost from the beginning, but this was probably due to viewer awareness brought on by hype about the twist ending.  At this point, I would bet that many first-time watchers will guess the  ending.  But, I wouldn't let that stop you from watching.  This package is  more than the delivery at the end.  The whole trip is so expertly planned  that it should be hard to be disappointed when the still intreaging  destination is finally reached.Most everyone already knows that the  little boy in this movie sees ghosts.  &quot;They don't know they are  dead&quot;, he says, &quot;They only see what they want to see.&quot;  Most everyone knows that the kid playing the part (Haley Joel Osment) got  great reviews.  If you doubt the reviews on this score, you need to watch  the movie.  Personally, the only reason I wasn't too disappointed that the  sprite didn't win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor was that the  award went to the incredible Michael Cain.The movie has the right  texture and shading throughout. It keeps you in the mood, even when it  moves at a languid, dream-like pace.  The scary scenes are made more so by  their unannounced and rather simple entrance onto this background.  The  director was using a bit of long overdue restraint (in Hollywood that is)  in presenting the more frightening scenes.  From my perspective, it  enhanced the effect.The cast was overall great in this film.  Willis'  portrayal of the psychiatrist as restrained, somewhat removed, and at times  almost dazed and vaguely confused, works the plot like a good mule works  the ground.  There won't be any trumpets for it, but the furrows are  straight and deep, and the job well done. And, in the end, if the healthy  crop comes in, that is where it all started.  The performance is more  easily appreciated the second time around.The most impressive part of  this film was the intensly moving way it portrayed this child's fear.  Hopefully, most children don't really see ghosts.  But their fear can be  just as breathlessly real, just as terrifying, and to them, just as  unexplainable and difficult to justify as is the character's fear in this  film.I wouldn't call this film great.  A great film I can't forget  or stop thinking about for weeks.  But, it is very good.  If I were to  criticize the film I suppose that I would have to say that it did tie up  neatly on all corners in the end.  However, I actually prefer a film of  this type that neatly finishes.  To be bluntly honest, I don't really go to  movies, rent, or buy videos much to expose myself to huge doses of reality.  Mostly, I find that reality is free, and I don't particularly want to be  always laying down the bucks to get smacked up-side the head with yet  another pointless dose of it.	4.0	The Sixth Sense Takes a Stab at Your Five	2000-03-29	2	2	0

You didn't know what to expect throughout the whole film. I love this movie and watch it regularly just like Shyamalan's other film &quot;Signs&quot;. I love Shyamalan's work. His movies are emotional and of course scary and you really get into the movie. I can't wait to see his new film &quot;The Village&quot;. But BUY THIS DVD if you haven't yet.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A6ZM6AMKKB8GM	Helen	Having heard so much about this film and how great the twist was, I was a bit annoyed to work it out so earlier on.  When you are told that the twist is meant to be greater than &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; you think you  are in for a right treat.  Maybe next time I won't be so quick to listen to  others and anticipate great expectations.The film however, was one of  the most atmospheric movies I have ever seen and the acting was superb.  Haley Joel Osmant is a very lucky person to obtain such a talent and you  hope that he is guided correctly through the ranks to achieve further  success in the acting field.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the story  was cleverly constructed.  This film needs to be watched in the dark with  surround sound, the music and effects are captivating.After watching the  movie I carried on with the Special Features available on DVD and they were  very interesting, I particularly enjoyed the clues section.One final  point, I spent the whole film thinking &quot;Where is Donnie  Whalberg?&quot;, not so the teen pop star any more and almost  unrecognisable.

The plot is about a young boy who sees dead people. But these dead people think that they are alive. A psychiatrist who had a tragedy occur tries to help this young boy throughout the movie. The ending is surprising and very unpredictable. It actually is quite scary and I remember looking under my bed the first time I saw it. (I was like 10 or 11) Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment give quite wonderful performances and this one will probably have you scared.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	The circular nightmares, the disaffections, the emotive lacks, the emotional wounds are presented with admirable wholeness and superb edition work.Through the eyes of a child you will be able to experience a very smart twist about Orpheus' myth. A murder, a notable psychiatrist, a very sick patient, a lonely woman who suffers the worst of the absences, a lavish and gifted child, whose perception doors are by far wider than the most of us. He owns the ability to watch a sordid landscape and establish a rapport with the world's dead. But the horror never will be gratuity but it will allow to overpass such similar and repeated common places in minors films. The redemption, the life seen from another perspective, the ancestral fear to death treated with absolute maturity and masterful.There is a beautiful and very, very hidden homage to a masterpiece film: The Red balloon in that clever sequence when our guest child is in the party and suddenly a red balloon elevates to roof and suddenly exploits: the claustrophobic anguish he will suffer brief moments later will make the whole circuit. The childhood simply has vanished.One of the last artistic masterpieces of the American Cinema!	5.0	The other gaze!	2005-04-01	4	2	2
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A6VYTKD83YQYC	"H. Johnson ""Hal Johnson"""	The first surprise that hit me upon viewing this film was Bruce Willis.  Understand, I'm not one of those who have made a hobby out of belittling the man's career.  On the contrary, I feel the guy has proven he has decent  acting chops, despite his pedigree as an action hero.  Still, when a friend  explained the plot of this movie, and Willis's part in it, my reaction was,  &quot;Aw, c'mon.&quot;  I just didn't think ol' Bruce could carry off the  part of a sincere, angst-ridden child psychologist.  Boy, was I ever wrong.  His understated, rock-steady performance was surely a cornerstone of the  film's success.That said, the cocky, sarcastic public persona that Bruce  Willis often puts forth serves to put the viewer on edge a bit: Will we see  a flicker of some &quot;Die Hard&quot; mannerism?  That, in itself, makes  the choice of Willis nothing less than brilliant casting, as that slightly  distracting element helps set the viewer up for later surprises.Some  critics have ridiculed the film for being overly sentimental.  Hm.  I just  didn't get that at all.  If anything, I found the sentimentality a bit  understated, given the story line.As for Haley Joel Osment, wow, the kid  is so talented it's scary.  I was all the more struck by the intensity of  his portrayal after watching the movie a second time.  A real key to the  movie's success is in how Willis allows Osment to carry the ball throughout  the film, and carry it he does.	5.0	Quite a ride.	2000-05-15	4	3	1

'The Sixth Sense' defies all genre categories; it manages to be scary, funny, and emotionally heart-wrenching all in the same film. Although the movie holds an atmosphere that is  initially unsettling, it finishes off in such a satisfactory way that  you'll want to watch it over and over again, just to keep experiencing the  feeling it gives you.Bruce Willis is refreshingly good as a child  psychologist, and Haley Joel Osment, as a troubled boy with a frightening  secret, is nothing less than extraordinary. If you ever thought kids  couldn't act, this guy will prove you wrong. Much of the emotional  resonance of the film comes from his pained looks and whispered words.I  can't recommend this one highly enough. It exemplifies what filmmaking  should be all about.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3FUBUJAIGM87T	"HorrorMan ""HM"""	"I see a vastly overrated movie called ""The Sixth Sense"" as far as its merits as a horror movie are concerned.  Sure, this is an almost halfway decent psychological thriller with a chill or two, but this movie simply does not have the ""goods"" or the requisite structure to be called a pure and effective horror movie.""The Sixth Sense"" is about a gifted child who has a ""sixth sense"" which allows him to actually see ghosts and dead people...to the child it is a depressing and horrifying burden that he does not want nor understand.  A psychiatrist played by Bruce Willis is determined to help the boy, but actually finds out something quite dark about his own reality as opposed to that of the child...this part ends up overshadowing the entire movie and weakening it as a whole.Clearly, the best scenes of the movie from a horror movie fan's perspective are the apparitions and visions of dead people the little boy encounters, however, these scenes are relatively few and far between.  Probably the scariest scene (if you can even call it that) is the part where the boy sees the lady ghost in a robe who is quite creepy...the boy hides from her as the chilly air is certainly symbolic of the creepy scene from that part.However, aside from these images of dead people and ghosts, ""The Sixth Sense"" is basically without a villain...there is no source of evil or danger that the characters encounter in this flick.  As far as its merits as a horror movie is concerned, ""The Sixth Sense"" is like a snow that won't stick because it's not cold enough or a cloud that wants to pour rain but can't because it lacks the necessary moisture from which the rain can be produced...such is the same thing for ""The Sixth Sense"" as a horror movie.  The atmosphere necessary for a horror movie is present only when the audience sees the deathly images from the boy's perspective, but this simply is not enough to create a horror movie...nice psychological drama with metaphysical elements which are creepy, but no hard and fast substance from which a horror movie can be derived.However, it could certainly be argued that ""The Sixth Sense"" was not made for the purpose of being a horror movie and that may very well be true.  But, as a horror movie, this movie fails miserably and completely.  I thought that ""The Sixth Sense"" was a mildly entertaining movie that illustrates a connection between the psyche of possibly blessed individuals with the supernatural and metaphysical reality we all so long to understand, but as a horror movie, ""The Sixth Sense"" basically sucks.  I would attach a VERY WEAK AMAZON.com TWO STARS rating to this movie...in fact, my official rating is 1.75 STARS because it really isn't that good, period.Incidentally, the idea of this sixth sense and psychic connection with the supernatural was done before and much better I might add in Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" which IS very scary and a timeless classic...I highly recommend ""The Shining"" over ""The Sixth Sense"" if you are interested in this psychic subject matter within the framework of a real horror movie.  In short, ""The Sixth Sense"" is a below average to average psychological-thriller movie overall and a very poor excuse for a horror movie."	2.0	"1.5 STARS: I see a vastly overrated so-called ""horror movie"" named ""The Sixth Sense"""	2005-06-12	12	4	8
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A35XP0ROXJZ6N9	Howard Holm	I purchased this almost on a whim.  Although the movie had received a lot of aclaim, I thought it might be interesting, but probably not great.  I was wrong. This is a movie I will remember, watch again, and show to  friends.  Knowing in advance that there was a &quot;surprise&quot; ending,  I suspected that it wouldn't be much of a surprise.  As the director had  planned, I picked up all the wrong foreshadowing and none of the actual  clues that were clear in retrospect.The acting by Haley Joel Osment was  extrordinary.  He managed to make a difficult premise believable by showing  you the fear in his belief.  Regardless of whether he turns out in the end  to be psychotic or gifted you empathize with his fear even though the movie  will not have most people shaking with fear themselves.  Bruce Willis turns  in a respectable and believable performance and plays to the child  well.Unfortunately, I must agree with other reviewers who commented that  the &quot;mandatory previews&quot; were extremely unpleasant.  I am  revolted by the arrogant and insulting attitude that paying customers are  nothing more than revenue sources to be harvested by marketing.  Given my  low expectations when I bought the DVD, if I had realized it came with  mandatory previews I would not have purchased it.  Since I will pay closer  attention to that detail in the future, it is very likely that I will not  buy DVDs with this misfeature that I might otherwise have purchased.	5.0	Captivating and Surprising	2000-04-23	2	2	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	ARJ4W05FDPQZ9	"Howie ""tomas"""	If you were coming to this film expecting a horror film, then your disappointment is understandable.  I watched Mr. Shyamalan's work backwards chronologically: first SIGNS, then UNBREAKABLE, and now THE SIXTH SENSE.  So in a way I approached this movie understanding that the premise - &quot;I see dead people&quot; - is not the theme, but merely a vehicle for the theme (in the same way that the alien invasion of SIGNS was not the theme).This is clearly one of the best pieces of filmmaking to come out of the Hollywood Slums in a long time.  It transcends many of the cliches that have gripped Tinseltown.  Shyamalan's technical brilliance and power of vision are so refreshing.  He is a filmmaker to watch, the only filmmaker since The Master - Hitchcock - to wear the mantle.The performances are stunning.  Willis and Osmet are brilliant together, as is Osmet's mother.  The depth with which they portray their roles is evident in their eyes; each is willing to give the other the space they need to develop their characters, and the director skilfully moves them forward.This film isn't about ghosts, or gothic horror, or the undead, or anything else like that.  It's about forgiveness.  Well, I suppose that's the simple answer.  But, it's a credit to Shymalan's genius that he is able to deal with such deeply human themes in the context of a ghost story, without falling prey to the typical Hollywood cliches (like &quot;Ghost&quot;).Night is becomming one of my favorits directors.  His work transcends film and becomes art of a type wholly distinct, much like Hitchcock and Kubrick before him.  It will be fun to follow his career!This is a masterpiece.

The fact that you are forced to watch the LONG previews each time really dampens my excitement of an otherwise excellent DVD.  Not only do the previews start immediately  upon hitting &quot;Play&quot;, you AREN'T ALLOWED TO MENU OUT OF THEM.  The  ability to directly access the Movie is one of the primary reasons I prefer  DVD to VHS.  I paid my money for the DVD, so I should be able to decide if  I want to watch the previews each time I watch the movie.  The fact that  the DVD manufacturer purposely rigged this DVD to prevent escape from the  previews makes it even more of an insult.  If this type of thing becomes  the norm for DVDs, I think it will kill the format.  If Sixth Sense weren't  so good, I'd return it because of the previews.

Worth seeing for sure, although repeat viewings offer diminishing returns.The 1080p transfer is mediocre, with subdued colors, and a flat, two-dimensional look: the mediocrity continues with extras that are warmed over trifles taken from the previous DVD ""special edition"", which, frankly, weren't all that special. The sound fares a bit better, with the rear speakers used quite effectively at times. In all, a slight, barely noticeable upgrade in picture quality from the SD edition, for all but the most discernible viewer.If you don't own any other editions of this film, rent before you buy; owners of the SD edition can safely pass this up... or at least wait, until the price comes down on this one."	3.0	Good movie gets mediocre Blu-Ray treatment	2008-10-02	6	4	2

[Many have come and gone...to me, the most memorable was Tatum O'Neal in &quot;Paper Moon&quot;.] It will be quite interesting to see Haley in his future roles in the film industry as he progresses through his teens, into adulthood and beyond...I sincerely hope he makes a lifelong career out of acting.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A32GLRK2JC5OXY	"HumorousSmile ""J-Biz"""	M. Night Shyamalan's debut as the masterful storyteller/director began with this most mysterious and heartfelt film, The Sixth Sense. The last time I saw The Sixth Sense was over six years ago and it was as though I enjoyed it even more now than I did the first time I saw it in theatres. Shyamalan's script is woven so beautifully and with such great care that the viewer will be yearning to find answers to the many questions this film forces one to develop.The Sixth Sense starts out with a bang (with probably the best performance by Donnie Wahlberg I've ever seen on the big screen) and leaves the audience almost trembling. As the story begins after this shocking introduction, we see Bruce Willis a year later after his career has been somewhat destroyed by the terrible events that occurred a year prior. Willis plays a child psychologist, and begins treatment through brief clinical sessions with a young boy (played memorably by Haley Joel Osment). Osment seems terribly disturbed and Willis appears determined to solve this troubled boy's problems. But as the story begins to unfold and the audience learns of Osment's nightmarish ailment, Willis finds that helping this boy will take far more effort than he could have ever imagined.It is hard to capture the beauty of The Sixth Sense in a few paragraphs, but the simplicity of its execution is enough to show that original films can still grab an audience better than any mind-blowing special effect. The Sixth Sense manages to keep the crowd attentive without a single special effect for almost two hours. This movie is not only a good thriller, but its dramatic elements will sometimes grasp at you without letting you go.An excellent and unforgettable performance by Toni Collette and one of the greatest ghost stories ever told. If you are not a fan of horror, do not fret; this is not a horror film. But there are definitely a few good jumps to be enjoyed. This movie can be seen over and over again and will one day be known as a classic work of film-making. This is by far the most superior M.

Bruce Willis (not one of my favorite performers) was good in the film, nice and understated, and Haley Joel Osment is a talented little boy-although I found his performance not always sympathetic-sometimes downright annoying, especially the &quot;Stuttering Stanley&quot; scene, which reminded me of another annoying child performance-the &quot;Redrum&quot; mishigas from &quot;The Shining&quot; (another overrated, silly film directed by the once-great Stanley Kubrick). I do not think that this is a great film of lasting value-but an entertaining one by a young filmmaker who may or may not mature into a great director.	2.0	OK but overrated	2000-12-04	16	4	12

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A39N2LNAKIU23O	"""jackcoleman"""	Twists are great in movies.  They are especially great for the Box Office.  It changes the audience's understanding of the rest of the movie and all they can talk about is why they didn't spot the twist sooner.  Primal Fear had a great twist ending.  Ditto, the Usual Suspects.  Now, add The Sixth Sense to this list.  Notice they all did great at the Box Office.  The lesson to the studios is to put more surprises into their scripts.However, wheras Primal Fear and the Usual Suspects were overshadowed by their shocking revelations, The Sixth Sense will be remembered not so much for it's twist but for it's original story: a boy that sees dead people.  Why hadn't this story been made before?  It seemed so obvious.  It is a child's worst nightmare - being able to see ghosts and not being able to tell anyone about it.The reason a movie like this wasn't made before was because the script required an adult performance from a 10 year old.  Impossible?  No, but it needed a very special kid.  Perhaps there was only one child in 10 million who could have acted in this movie but fortunately, Haley Joel Osment defied the odds and got the part.  He was a revelation.  His performance seems only better when you look at other American child performances.  Often, they can destroy a good movie with their annoying cuteness.  Check out Liar, Liar.Osment was exemplary and honoured for it.  I, for one, thought it unjust that his co-star didn't receive any such accolade.  The performance of Bruce Willis was subtle and underwhelming.  We never expected a surprise, simply because there never seemed anything out of place with this resolutely plain character.  We saw an ordinary child psychiatrist desperate to help one of his patients.  Willis, knew a lot more about the character but never over-emphasised it.  So what, you ask?  Well, Kevin Spacey won an Oscar for the same thing in Suspects.I expect a lot from this director now.  Anytime, a director writes and direct, I question which one he did better.  I can't decide in this case.  His script was marvellous, with very few holes.  But his direction was methodical and moody, creating a very spooky atmosphere.  Kudos to Night on both counts.	4.0	Twist and Shout	2000-10-12	1	1	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1D600X7EDGIVD	"Jack Cox ""Reviewer Extraordinare"""	When I compared this film and American Beauty. The Sixth Sense was the best film of the year. The storyline is amazing and it is remarkable. Not very scary but it's amazing how good the story is and it keeps you glued to your chair. I don't why Michael Caine deserved to win but Haley Joel Osment (Cole Sear) was amazing and he stole every scene he was in. Bruce Willis is phenomenal as Dr. Malcolm Crowe he nearly dominates the movie. A performance by Toni Collette as Cole's mother was great and in a way deserved an academy award if only she had more screen time. This was one of the best movies and people liked it but Ignored it. In my opinion this film deserved Best Picture. It was a touching story and not a murderous tale like American Beauty. It is very sad too.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	Bruce Willis is an excellent psychiatrist. Reserved, compassionate, slow  and yet at time afraid, afraid of the truth that necessarily comes out of  the child's mouth. And what truth ! Dead people are visiting some living  people in order to ask them to do something, to communicate something to  other living people. They seem to need an intercessor, a go-between. The  child has to be frightened mute and then frantic by such an experience. The  psychiatrist has to enlarge his mind to be able to get this turth in and  then to accept it and then to deal with it, and find out the only thing  that can make the child assume this communication : they try to speak to  you, to give you some message, some message you have to deliver, no matter  how hard it may be, because the welfare of the dead is more important than  the welfare of the living. And yet, this knowledge enables the child and  the doctor to realize that the welfare of the living, at least of those  they love or who love them, is paramount and they have to communicate with  them to save their balance, to save their life, to save the meaning of  their life. This is done with tact and sympathy and the film is so slow and  so calm that we even think at times we are in a dream world like  Coleridge's Kubla Khan. And we hear the dulcimer of death playing the tune  of our life-dance, a tune that we know will come too soon to an end and  then we will have to look for our go-between. Will he/she/it be you or you  or you ? Who knows ? Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities IX and II	4.0	Life can only exist through death	2000-08-02	0	0	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A10E0IZ8TY5XRR	Jaelin B.	This is a very interesting movie. The characters are beautifully played. The plot is certainly an interesting one. It's really more like a mystery than a thriller. You spend a lot of time trying to figure out why the dead are bothering this kid. You go through the same efforts that the psychologist does to figure out how to help him.Also, this DVD release includes some very cool deleted scenes. Often, the deleted scenes are deleted because they didn't add anything to the movie, but these were deleted basically because they added too much. They were cut for time, or because they &quot;gave away too much&quot;.  The director's commentary is also great.  I give the special features of this movie Five stars.The downside to this movie is that once you've seen the ending or figured it out, it doesn't have much rewatch value. You may go back once or twice to find all of the &quot;clues&quot;, but once you've done that, you probably won't want to watch it again.	3.0	Good movie, but lacks in rewatch value.	2003-09-08	4	2	2

This movie, not only  crosses the line between good and evil, but has also received 6 1999  Academy Award (Oscar)nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director,  Best Original Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor, Haley Joel  Osment.Even though no Oscar nomination was available to Bruce Willis  this year, this performance will go down as &quot;the performance of his  career!&quot; The best feature available on this DVD, is probably the  EXTENDED ENDING.  You might of thought this movie's ending was spectacular,  but there was more that was hidden from you!(IF IT WASN'T FOR HALEY JOEL  OSMENT'S ELECTRIFYING PERFORMANCE, THIS MOVIE WOULD NOT HAVE SURPASSED THE  EMOTIONAL FEELING OF WHAT THE AUDIENCES WERE ABOUT TO EXPECT! )A movie  that signals with breakthrough performances and a ricochet of events,  matches with &quot;The Sixth Sense.&quot; I give this movie a 10 out of 10!	5.0	WHAT A HORRIFYING, CLAUSTROPHOBIC PHENOMENON!	2000-02-19	1	0	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AL5OEDM8TPTKV	James Hiller	From the moment Cole's haunting face comes on the camera, and he says those trembling words, &quot;I see dead people,&quot; I fell under the rapturous spell of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;. It truly is a work of  masterful storytelling and a cinematographer's paradise. Stealing the film  is Haley Joel Osmet, giving a performance in a terribly difficult role.  Much is made of the twist at the end, which totally surprised me, but the  entire film works as a whole, and teaches some important lessons.The DVD  version of this film is extraordinary. The bonus material added much to my  own enjoyment. There is a section called &quot;Rules and Clues&quot; in  which the filmmakers discuss the rules laid out in the film, and unnoticed  visual reminders throughout. I found it particularly bothersome to have to  scroll through a few previews before getting to the main screen... but once  there, it was worth it!	5.0	Chilly wonderment	2000-03-28	1	0	1

What's left is a moderately interesting story with a twist that provides more plot holes  than answers. There are some good performances and, thankfully, it is  devoid of special effects which so often degrade a film's integrity. The  ghosts tend to be used more as props than antagonists and, aside from a  &quot;jump&quot; scene or two, there's nothing particularly frightening  although there is some tension in a couple of scenes. Despite the mass  appeal, the Sixth Sense isn't anything that you haven't seen before but  it's not a bad rent.	3.0	&quot;I see dead people&quot;	2000-02-16	31	7	24

He also chose to work with a great script, a wonderful cast and was given competent  direction.  The master review sums up the film's appeal rather nicely, so I  will not repeat what has already been said.  Just some impressions, this is  not a film that you will view and easily forget.  It raises a number of  interesting thought bytes with regard to the &quot;next realm&quot;, if one  exists. I found the film to be wonderful viewing, with a relatively gentle  touch being applied to all aspects of the story.	4.0	Poltergeist for grown ups	2000-07-17	0	0	0

With all the hype, I, Jameson Thottam, was set up to be disappointed! I, Jameson Thottam, wasn't! Cool movie! I, Jameson Thottam, was interested all the way through, and loved the ending!The kid in this move was perfect for the part. His Mom was believable! I, for one, get tired of all the ""perfect 10"" Hollywood versions of Mom! This Mom was a real one; hard working, loving, divorced single parent. The kid had a right to be screwed up....but he wasn't!Bruce was convincing as a child psychiatrist. He only slips back into the Bruce Willis we all know and love once, when he calls a friend of his wife ""Cheesedick"". (What a name! What kind of cheese, I wonder?)He is compassionate, thorough and very psychiatrist-like, except for his need to look up stuff in the dictionary. Oh well, no one said he was a BRILLIANT psychiatrist. Maybe he was dyslexic. In any case, it is hard to fault the structure and theme of this movie; it was tight, with very few loose ends (trust me, it will all make even six levels of sense at the end!)My natural tendency is to compare the flick with ""A Stir of Echoes"", which has a similar story and features Kevin Bacon. I like Kevin Bacon's role, as well as the movie, but I think ""Sixth Sense"" is a better movie, mainly because of the better writing. I, Jameson Thottam, recommend watching it, even 2 or 3 times.Now if you know me, Jameson Thottam, you know I have to add a ""but"" to this review. Granted my hearing is't what it used to be, but I kept having to turn the volume up just to hear what was being said. Hey, you sound guys need to help here! I didn't think Bruce's wife did much acting, although none was required. This was pretty much a two-person show. There were some emotional sequences in the kid's dialogue that didn't make much sense to me, but they didn't ask for my help directing so let it be merely my opinion.I, Jameson Thottam, kind of wish we had a few more examples of this kid's seeing ""dead people"" but the movie stays interesting without it. I, Jameson Thottam, do think Big Bad Bruce and the munchkin who played the kid deserve praise for outstanding performances, and the ""mom"" deserves an award for being totally real!Jameson Thottam"	4.0	Jameson Thottam - won't spoil the surprise	2005-10-13	6	1	5

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A366S12KCZ280V	"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover"""	Over the years M. Night Shyamalan has directed some very good films. &#34;Unbreakable&#34;, &#34;Signs&#34; and &#34;The Village&#34; are just some of those. Of all Shyamalan's films however the one that stands out as his masterpiece has to be &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34;. One of the most suspenseful films of all time to be made &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34; is well crafted in playing on the viewers emotions as it draws them into the story. It all leads to a surprise ending that the viewer doesn't see coming.The acting is excellent lead by Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcolm Crowe a child psychologist who is trying to help a 9 year old boy, Cole Sear played by Haley Joel Osment, with emotional issues. Everyone including Sear's mother thinks it is some kind of social issues he has but as Dr. Crowe digs deeper into what is bothering Cole it is revealed that Cole can see and talk to dead people. For one so young Haley Joel Osment gives an equally excellent performance that plays well off of Bruce Willis part.Then of course there is M. Night Shyamalan who wrote as well as directed &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34;. The story itself is well told. Easy to follow while keeping you in suspense what will happen next with a scene or two thrown in that will make you jump. The directing is masterful as well and no doubt that Shyamalan was on his game as he was making this movie. It is no wonder that many who have seen &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34; rate this both as one of their all time favorite movies and also Shyamalan's best work. If you haven't seen this film you have GOT to watch &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34;. I promise you will get caught up in the story and especially the ending. If you have seen it before, even with knowing the surprise ending, the film still stands up and is still captivating to watch. It is certainly for me one film I never tire of watching and is worthy of being in anyone's video library.	5.0	Shyamalan's Masterpiece	2013-10-30	0	0	0

Berry	You've not seen The Sixth Sense?Really?What's wrong with you?This is one movie I would say is mandatory for anyone who likes having their sense of reality flipped on its head. A child psychologist, Malcolm  Crowe, sensitively played by Bruce Willis, is shot by a former patient who  then commits suicide. A year later, his marriage falling apart, he takes on  a similar case, a young boy called Cole Sean- played by Haley Joel Osment -  who seems to be disturbed and preoccupied. Crowe soon discovers that his  new patient can see &quot;dead people&quot;, ghosts who make his life hell.  Slowly Cole comes to terms with his sixth sense, but this leads to a  devastating revelation which no one expects.Not only is this film  disturbing in concept but in execution. There is no gore to speak of, no  rising skeletons and no medieval demons. Instead there is suspense you  could cut with a knife and a desperately heart-rending end. In my humble  opinion it's criminal Haley Joel Osment didn't receive an Oscar for his  role - his acting is superb, and doesn't lapse into wide eyed trembling.

That's why he never speaks to his wife. I mean c'mon!  It's a Bruce Willis movie and he dies!  No way am I gonna give it  more than 2 stars!  He's the Jackal for god's sake! He prevented Armageddon  and was the Last Man Standing!  Make no mistake about it, this is NOT a  horror movie. This is a &quot;spooky&quot; drama, not a jump out of your  seat chiller.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AKWRQDC4LO3LE	J. Bone	When I'm considering purchasing a movie from Amazon, the only things I'm interested in are the picture/audio quality and supplemental features of the actual product.  Instead what I see is 5,000 subjective reviews of the movie itself.  First off, if I'm considering buying a movie to begin with, chances are pretty good that I've already seen it, which means I liked it enough to consider spending my hard-earned money to buy it. I think that applies to most people. So I could care less what your personal take is on the movie.  If I really wanted to know that, I could just hop over to Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb.It's the same thing as buying a baseball glove and in your review only talking about how baseball is a better sport than football, or buying your kid clothes with Dora the Explorer on them and giving it 5 stars just because it's such a great cartoon show.  That's worthless, because I want to know about the actual quality of the item I'm purchasing. The same goes with Blu-Rays (and DVDs).In case that still confuses you, I want to know how is the picture quality (DNR, artifacting, banding, aliasing, black levels, etc), the audio quality (lossless/compressed, sound levels, surround activity, dynamic range, dialogue clarity, etc), and content/quality of extras.  The unfortunate reality is most of these reviewers probably have no idea about such things, and are the same people who don't see a different between SD and HD programming and are happy as long as they get some sound and a picture on their screen.That's fine, I don't expect everyone to be an expert, but your subjective movie review is still pointless from a product review standpoint.  So in the future, please just refrain from being the 5,001st person to post your movie review here so those of us who want a more objective critique of the actual product can more easily see the helpful reviews, and instead post your movie review on a site like Rotten Tomatoes that is intended for that specific purpose. Thanks in advance!Also, Amazon makes matters worse by combining reviews for both the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of a movie, further adding to the confusion.  They are two completely different products, Amazon!	4.0	Worthless Movie Reviews	2010-11-16	40	20	20

For one thing, the ending makes absolutely no sense when you go back and think about it.  And I really don't think it's  necessary to show a kid with the back of his head blown off.  My advice:  do not buy or rent this movie, because you will be sadly disappointed!  I  was.  I really wish they'd redo the ratings system so I could give this  flick 0 stars, because that is what it really deserves.  For a great watch,  get a REAL Bruce Willis movie.

And most of that money was spent to get more control over my home video experince.  Mainly the useless previews on almost all VHS tapes sold anymore is what I hated.  I paid for this, I don't want anymore of your ads.  Now that I have this DVD (not for long, it goes back in the morning) I am yet again forced to deal with these previews.  5 or so of them.  And for bad movies too.  Dusk til Dawn 3?  WTF?!?!  If this is what is to be expected of BHVE, then I'll steer clear of them in the future.

The scene where Willis was  telling Osment that he can not be Cole's counselor anymore and Osment's  reaction is definitely oscar worthy in and of itself.  The famous line,  &quot;I see dead people&quot;, is probably going to be one of the most  memorable lines and no one will be able to say it with the intensity that  Haley Joel Osment was able to.

It seems to meander without a real direction. Another flaw would be the ""secret""... by the time the boy says ""...

My answer: it (Beauty) is a much better film. Duh.  Anyway, 6S stands on its own. I guessed the so-called &quot;twist&quot;  ending about 10 minutes into the movie, as I suspect others did, but it was  still chilling nonetheless.  I never felt bored or let down as some have  said.  I thought it moved ahead at a perfect pace.  Osment showed that he  is a young actor who will probably succeed as an adult actor as well.  Bruce Willis continues to impress me as an actor of depth and breadth.  There were a couple moments that actually scared/startled me into a vocal  response in the theater.  The ending was too abrupt, but that problem might  be answered in the DVD's extended ending.  Well worth the watching	4.0	Great  chiller flick	2000-04-10	0	0	0

Each actor and actress in this film has extraordinary  talent.Chances are you know the storyline.  If you don't know, the story  line is very, very simple.  Bruce Willis plays a child psychilogist.  He  gets a patient that claims to see dead people(Haley Joel Osment).  Bruce  Willis does not beleive the child, but spends the movie trying to help him.  However, this movie is filled with twists and turns in the plot that make  this movie an absolute work of art.It is difficult to say how awsome  this movie is without giving the movie away.  The writer/director, M. Night  Shyamalan, did an supurb job with leaving suttle hints throughout the  movie.  The movie is written as any great movie is; you feel every emotion  that the character goes through, you feel the fear and turmoil that the  child goes through.  The suspense leaves you on the edge of your seat the  entire movie.This movie is a definite must see, no matter what type of  movie you love!	5.0	A Timeless Masterpiece	2000-08-07	3	3	0

So I was waiting to see how they exicuted that. However, from all the hype, and  reviews I got, I truely did expect more. The ghosts did get a little old. I  must say though, I really think Cole's play added to the movie. It kind of  lifted your spirits, in this dark, semi-dull movie. I would see it though.

All they do is mess up teh experience you will have when sitting &quot;quietly&quot; in the &quot;dark&quot; to watch it by telling  you how it had bad actors or how the effects ot storylines were  unbelievable. To heck with all of them. Sit yourself down on a  &quot;quiet&quot;, &quot;dark&quot; night and just watch this movie. I had  hair stand up on my neck for the first time since Alien back in high  school. It was really creepy and the twist at the end made my heart just  break. It was awesome. I watch A LOT of movies and rarely give high  reviews, but what can I say? I love having a movie inject pure, raw emotion  into my bloodstream. This one did it over and over. It is also one of the  few movies that can be seen again and again. In fact, the second time you  watch it, it's even better because you &quot;get&quot; it.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1BQL9MJ9JHJP3	Jeremy George	Sight, smell, taste, touch, sound, and seeing dead people.In the '90s we've been constantly bored with horror movies: the Scream trilogy, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and so on and so on. Finally a horror film that  gives depth to it's characters! This is just a great old-fashioned ghost  story. What better place to set a ghost story than in Philadelphia? Every  building has a history behind it (including young Cole's school). Any film  that drops clues (the color red) and demands repeated viewings is worth  buying. Haley Joel Osment (Cole), who may have the most lines in the movie,  truley gives the year's best supporting performance (sorry Michael Caine).  The movie grabs you immediately in the first five minutes and gives one of  the best endings in recent memory. This is the role Bruce Willis will be  best remembered.Also impressive is Toni Collete as Lynn Sear, the  mother of Cole who feels so hopeless in helping her obviously torchured  son. She makes triangle pancakes for him, takes him for a joy ride in a  supermarket parking lot, and arranges get-togethers with the other kids,  but she can't help him. Only Malcom Crowe can (Willis). But maybe Cole can  also help Malcom. Only American Beauty was better in '99. Buy the DVD.  Extra footage is very engrossing.	5.0	One of the decade's best!	2000-04-17	58	47	11

I'm sure many would agree if I called &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of modern day.Fanstastic plots, terrific acting, wonderous production considering the film's low budget relative to other film-hits of the day, and fine structuring plague this masterpiece. I use the term &quot;plague&quot; not because any of these aspects subtract points from the film's overall credibility, but because casual film-goers seem to be oblivious of any of these characteristics. So what if you guessed the ending halfway through the movie: most people didn't! And to think that this movie offers no replay value after an initial viewing is downright tragic.

This movie is stale.When I began watching it I was under the impression that this was a thriller. It's not a thriller in the least. Nothing is scary or really creepy. Although it can be intriguing it lacks suspense. This movie is more ironic than scary. I disliked it because I was overexcited because of the hype surrounding this movie and I was disappointed when it failed to live up to that hype. It also failed to create any lasting impression on me. This movie is basically for people who fear walking in the dark.One more thing.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3MQ672FYFNM7B	JGC	"""The Sixth Sense"" is Bruce's 1999 blockbuster psychological thriller that became one of his most watched movies ever. This is not one of my favorites though. I'm not crazy about it because the movie is incredibly disturbing and almost tragic. Personally, I hate watching bad things happen to good people and there is no better man than the one and only Bruce Willis. It's almost like a story within a story within a story. But it moves very slowly and if you're like me the first time you watch it you'll need to go back and watch some parts again because it just didn't jive. As always Bruce was exceptional (the man has never given a less than excellent performance) in this movie, playing Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child social worker. He conveyed so many different emotions and was completely believable. But overall, the movie wasn't entertaining or even educational or enlightening. Instead, as I have stated, it was very complicated. The movie does take a couple of twists and turns, most notably during the end. I didn't see what any of this had to do with the overall story though. What I thought the movie was trying to say is that death is very important and how we treat people after they pass away directly affects what happens in the present.

Since the DVD release, I've watched it two more times.  I'm still not bored with it.  Brilliantly paced and  directed.  The music is phenomenal- I'm a huge fan of James Newton Howard.  Bruce Willis is understated and sedate- perfect for the atmosphere of the  film.  Haley Joel Osment is the most astounding young actor I've ever seen.  Amazing in concept and delivery and the DVD allows you to view deleted,  but very moving scenes.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1XSXUBCNFIM3W	Jim Jr	Not many films can really stand up to repeated viewings that will always surprise the viewer with new insites into the piece. &quot;Sixthe Sense&quot; is the exception to this rule.Each viewing reveals a new facet of the story, deepens the appreciation of the writing and, above all, amazes with the subtle and intricate performances of all the actors.Of course the first time the big surprise is the ending (although I must admit I had picked the actual ending as one of three early on, BUT each subsequent viewing has brought more and better surprises). Bruce Willis (until this film one of my least favorite actors but after this and &quot;Whole Nine Yards&quot; a favorite)creates a wonderful character with not one false note - deep, meaningful and brillant. Haley Joel Osment overwhelms you the first time you see the film and with each subsequent viewing your appreciation for his work grows more intense. No other child actor has ever come close to his accomplishments and few adults have either. This wasn't the work of the director, it comes from within this remarkable person.Even the story gets better with subsequent viewings. Little things that might have been missed previously will hit you and expand the pleasure. This is an excellent script, beautifully produced.If you've only seen this film once, you are depriving yourself of the continual pleasure of revisiting a masterpiece.	5.0	Should be watched over and over	2002-04-04	2	1	1
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A39XUWX0I4WH33	Jim K.	I'd like to know who to credit for the wonderful, beefy package that comes with the Vista Series.  They are quite nice compared to the regular snap-case, so I keep them in a drawer to protect them from the elements...Searching for something different to watch on a lonely Monday, I spotted THE PACKAGING of &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; in a local store -- that's why I picked it up.  I only knew that the movie was quite popular, and I had purchased and watched &quot;Unbreakable&quot; several months earlier.I was skeptical about the child actor when I bought this DVD.  As it turns out, the movie is quite remarkable and the Director: M. Night Shyamalan does a superb job.  His movies are quite different and tasteful.  Often the reviews or advertising compare him or this film to Alfred Hitchcock -- I think that's insulting to both of them.  There's nothing truly exciting in &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; but it's such a fine film that you will want to watch it again soon.  In fact, I plan to watch &quot;Unbreakable&quot; right away and then re-visit &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; to really get a feel for the director.Is it really a thriller or high drama?  I don't know; that's for you to conclude.  I will say that the taste and skill of Director: M. Night Shyamalan probably will leave one groping for words, and that's what sets an artist apart from everyone else.DVD picture is excellent and the sound is good, too, although there is nothing remarkable about it -- there doesn't need to be.	5.0	Vista Series, excellent product	2002-02-05	2	1	1

Malcolm is a child psychologist and Cole claims that he can see dead people.  They are all around him and they are attracted to Cole due to his psychic power.  Not only can he see them but some can follow him and talk to him.Malcolm feels that Cole is hallucinating.  Malcolm soon begins to believe Cole and realizes that Cole and a former patient, who had the same issues, may really have some special ability that no one else can perceive.  He convinces Cole to reach out and speak to the dead to see what they really want from him.  This leads to some interesting confrontations and revelations.....I really liked this movie and at some times it can really be creepy.  M.

A great movie will be remembered nottomorrow but in 30 years and this is the one. If you have seen the movie you will recall on your first viewing(trust me there will be more) how when the &quot;secret&quot; became evident your skin tightened your body locked and all your senses hightened.Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a child psychologist who is haunted by the memory of a patient he was unable to help. His marriage is crumbling. Then he meets Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a disturbed young boy, and feels that if he can help Cole he can regain his life and normality. The film is so many emotions all at once, fear, terror, sadness and relief. The script was written &amp; directed by Manoj Night Shyamalan from an original concept. The film is brilliantly shot by Tak Fujimoto(Philidelphia, Silence of the Lambs), and the acting is the best from everyone inloved. Bruce Willis has never been better, Toni Collette is brilliant as Cole's mother, and Haley Joel Osment is a future star. You may not recognise Donnie Walhberg (brother of Mark) as the lost patient Vincent and look out for Manoj in a brief supporting role.The disc. The disc is loaded with stuff, this is why we buy DVD folks.  Presented in anamorphic widescreen ratio (1.85:1). The film transfer is superb in low light, and crisp in well lit scenes, with no colour saturation whatsoever. Sound is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 English and French. Dialogue is easily heard, even in scenes with Cole whispering, there are no audio sync problems present. The surround channels carry mostly feel music from the soundtrack and the .1 channel is never tested.  The extras,did i say extras?, 2 movies for the price of one! .

Night Shyamalan has received for his films that followed.  All have been entertaining, and effective in some way, but all have fallen somewhat short of the expectations set by this masterpiece of a thriller.  ""The Sixth Sense"" is superbly written - so much so that figuring out the twist ahead of time in no way detracts from the effectiveness of the film.  Shyamalan is obviously in love with the art of filmmaking - this shows in the film, and even in the deleted scenes featured on the DVD.  The casting in the film is also excellent.  Bruce Willis nearly always turns in a solid performance, but he's excellent in this role.  Toni Collette is great, and Haley Joel Osment deserves special mention. He handles his demanding role in a way few kids could.  ""The Sixth Sense"" is scary without cheap gimmicks (gore and monster jumping out unexpectedly, for instance), suspenseful without a manipulative score, and ultimately touching without being sappy.

Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is six-years-old and claims to see the spirits of dead people all around him. It seems that Cole has psychic powers and can channel the ghosts of those who were troubled. Cole doesn't understand his powers, and he has little control over them; he's constantly terrified by what he sees, and Dr. Crowe is the only one with whom he feels he can share this secret. However, as the doctor digs deeper into Cole's strange powers, it leads to strange and unexpected consequences for both of them. M.

Blu-ray contains quite a few extras regarding the film's production and includes selected scenes the director felt were excellent but were cut during editing as they didn't contribute to or detracted from the flow and pace of the film. If you haven't seen the film, do NOT watch any of the ""extras"" before viewing the film as they will spoil it (and the ending in particular). That said, the extras on the Blu-ray were enlightening about what the director and others were thinking as they produced the film. Well worth watching, including the deleted scenes, AFTER watching the film the first time.This is NOT a ""horror"" film. It is a mystery/thriller along the lines of a modern ""Hitchcock"" tale with unexpected twists and turns including a major one at the very end. Film content has already been extensively reviewed by many others and I won't put any spoilers here to ruin the ending -- its box office success and lasting popularity speaks for itself. If you haven't seen this film, don't look up the ending (or skip to it) as you'll utterly spoil the experience. A great contrast for Bruce Willis compared to the typical action roles he's played. He does extremely well in this film, as does the young boy who plays the role of his patient.

I was somewhat hesitant about seeing a movie with a little kid (haley Joel Osment) as a main character. In the past this has been an irritant. My  fears where completely unfounded however, the acting was up to par, and we  where engrossed through out the entire movie. Unfortunately some people  have &quot;given away&quot; the twist in this movie in their reviews, if  you haven't seen this movie, probably why you are reading this, be  carefull, it will take away from the movie.The special features are  O.K. but nothing to write home about, especially if you find, like we did,  that the director is just a tat self-important.The quality of the video  and sound are up to spec although a mortal sin was committed by putting  previews on this DVD from which you cannot escape with the menu button.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3FA5MCPWRL1H5	Johncagebubblegum	I hate movies that are overrated; especially if I can't see what the big deal is. Why is 'The Sixth Sense' so ridiculously overrated? Is it money? I don't understand. I read 5-stars reviews everywhere saying this is simply a masterpiece, and that Haley Joel Osment-kid is being hailed as being the most brilliant actor walking around on the face of this earth. Well, let me tell you that all ain't right. A few important points.1: Let's get rid of the silly rumour that this movie is scary. It isn't scary... at all. The ghosts that you see are just plain people with sometimes a head-injury of pale face, nothing scary about that. The things that happen, like drawers and cupboards opening up by themselves, isn't scary at all either; how different that was in 'Poltergeist', where the scene with the chairs suddenly standing on the kitchentable gave the viewer an eerie feeling... &quot;what's more to come?&quot;, I thought then. With the similar scene in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; all I did was be annoyed by that Haley Joel Osment-kid with his terrible overacting.2: That brings me to point nr. 2. Haley Joel Osment. A good actor? Well, maybe if you enjoy looking at a snotty face and wet eyes for 2 hours. But it didn't work for me. You almost hear the director saying to him: &quot;More emotion Haley, more emotion!&quot;3: The bad plot. Bruce Willis is a ghost himself, how incredibly shocking and original. He didn't know that himself? His wife doesn't look at him, doesn't speak to him (because he's dead) but he assumes that it's &quot;bad communication&quot;. Well, quite silly if you ask me. He's with that Haley Joel-kid's mom, still thinking he's just a living human being, and they sit across of eachother. Did he just think it was normal that the mother didn't speak to him? Doesn't that ring a bell? Very, very badly done.'The Sixth Sense' doesn't live up to it's hype, and that's an understatement. It isn't scary, it isn't moving (well, maybe in a shallow way if you're into that), and I wouldn't give this just one star if it wasn't considered as being one of the best movies of 1999. Let's say it keeps you fairly entertained for two hours, but after that it's a cold shower. With avoiding this you're missing out on nothing.	1.0	Mediocre at best, really bad at worst	2002-12-17	37	12	25

OK, kid, here's your acting job:  convey the pain of the outsider who bears the uncommunicable injustices of  the dead, and still be a regular kid who loves your mom.  What a slam dunk  for an acting Oscar.  The sequence involving a videotape is film narrative  at a different level.  How many films have a sequence that revelatory?

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1F6DHVFE1ZIXX	John	Before I finally rented this movie, I had heard all sorts of things from friends at school about how it has this huge surprise ending that you would never guess.  They were kind enough to not give it away to me, but unfortunately M. Night Shyamalan was not that kind.  The second that Bruce Willis gets shot, I had guessed the ending.  It was the only logical conclusion I could come to after seeing all those &quot;I see dead people&quot; commercials for the movie.  When I got to the end of the movie and found out that I had of course been right about what the &quot;big surprise&quot; was I have to say that I was very dissapointed.  However, the movie itself is good.  The only problem I have is that the ending leaves you dissapointed.  M. Night should have made it less obvious.  Anyway, the movie is great.  It is very entertaining and holds your attention everystep of the way.  Even though I had figured out the ending, the movie had me so intranced that I didn't notice at first how Willis never has a conversation with anyone but Osment.

This movie is based on the same premise as so many other movies lately:  ""Dead people contact the living to help them solve their own murder.""  We saw it in ""What Lies Beneath,""  ""Stirs of Echoes"" and many others.  I could probably fill a page listing movies with a similar plotline.  I have to admit that this movie did have a twist to the ending that I haven't seen before but that didn't make up for the routine nature of the plot.A lot has been said about Haley Osment, the actor that played the psychic child and what a phenomenal performance he gave.  I'll admit that he did a good job,but the role was not extremely challenging.  The entire movie he had the same expression on his face - sort of a like someone that is nauseous.  ""I'm nauseous. . .  and I see dead people."" The role really didn't require him to show much range of emotion (other than screaming occasionally).Other reviewers have pointed out the gaping holes in the plot so I won't repeat all of them, but suffice it to say that there are many.  Example: Why would the girl that knows that one parent was poisoning her, not tell someone.  Instead she decides that the best thing to do would be put it on video tape, then hide the tape so that - maybe- the right parent will find the tape and know what happened. That makes sense. I will mention one other one has to do with the ending.  (If you haven't seen the movie and want to be surprised don't ready any further. )  On all of the ""dead people,"" their wounds are clearly visible.  The Willis character looks fine until the end of the movie.  Then suddenly we see the bullet wound and blood. What makes him so different?  Shouldn't he be walking around with a hole his chest and a bloody shirt?In summary, this is just a routine movie.

It is unarguable that he was struck by a certain genius at the time and this film shines from begining to end like no other. This film would not be ""the spectacular"" film it is without it's cast from  Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis's characters and their on screen chemestry to the very brief and virtually unrecognizable and chilling performance of Donnie Walberg in the begining.This is the only M. Night DVD I own,the other films he has made aren't even in the same league.Perhaps some time in the future he may yet again hit his mark in film, but it has been a rough and bumpy road for the directer ever since The Sixth Sense was released in 1999. This film is a journey between two characters in search of an answer that the two eventually help each other in the end discover and solve.

It starts out great; very effective and spooky.  But then the film basically goes nowhere and then stops with what I feel is  almost a cop-out of an ending.  There really is no conclusion.  Looking  back on the film after having seen it, there really isn't much to the story  as it is.  It's an ok film, and Osmet and Willis are both good, I just wish  they had more of a story to work with.	3.0	My comments	2000-03-29	3	1	2

Since that time I have seen bits and pieces of the film, but had no desire to watch it again. I thought it was a great film, but it was just not for me.Well yesterday and today I watched the film in full for the first time since 98/99 and saw it from a different perspective that I failed to see in 98/99.  I liked it so much, I decided to buy myself a used copy and await its delivery.Excellent film and superb acting by everyone involved.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A29H4O8SZ8S3G2	Jordan	This was one of the several movies that got many nominations that I'd seen before Oscar night. It was also one of the worst that was nominated for many. Surely Osment deserves accolades for his performance, but it was,  overall, a repetitive, dry film. (Osment, by himself, was the only reason  this got 3 stars as opposed to 2). We clearly get the point by the middle  of the two hours that he sees dead people and something is wrong with him,  but, in a time management move comparative to that of The Cider House  Rules, Osment continues to see dead people for about an hour too long; it  would have made a very nice short picture. But no, no, no! We're going to  have a nice long movie that we can shove enough dead people in to call a  thriller and make thousands of bottoms across America fall asleep while  watching! Not only the fact that it progresses into borderline boredom, but  that I never thought the ending to be that great! Oooh so he was dead the  whole time, what's the point? It's a nice little twist but nothing as good  as how reviewers here have glorified it. It was a moderate film with a  moderate ending. Many characters, as well, with the omission of Willis'  character, develop much throughout the story. Holes in the accuracy make up  for another part as why so-called horror flicks shouldn't be up for awards.  Lucky to get 3 stars.	3.0	This Changes &quot;The Oscar Goes To..&quot; to &quot;And The Big deal Is?&quot;	2000-05-26	4	0	4

Sixth Sense is nothing but a Jacob's Ladder rip-off yet this movie was hailed by so-called horror fans as an ""original psychological masterpiece"". If that's a masterpiece, you better start picking up trash and framing it because I just saw the Mona Lisa roll by in the form of a slightly crushed pepsi can. And if this is original, I just saw a xerox copy machine create the most innovative work to date (Jacob's Ladder did this 15 years ago people).I've seen Unbreakable and Signs too, both the same formula as this film. All Shyamalan's movies are typical sappy Hollywood dramas 99.9% of the time then he comes up with the stupid endings. Pretty much his movies are essentially nothing but an excuse to show some gimmicky twist at the end so the general public (because no true horror fan is eating this stuff up) could pat themselves on the back and say ""I am not close-minded, I like all genres of movies such as horror"", the same way so many clueless pre-packaged cultured fools think they're into ""sophisitcated music"" when they watch VH1. The ending sure was the best part, not because it was shocking, but because at that point I knew this atrocity was over. Trying to impress people with a gimmicky ending, that's all this film is, I can't put it any simpler than that. Everyhing else you saw in the movie was thrown in just to stretch this thing into a full length."	1.0	Calling this overrated is an understatement	2005-08-02	20	7	13

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A13KXWTN0DT878	"Josh ""Josh"""	For some off reason, it took two viewings of The Sixth Sense for me to actually like the movie. The first time I watched it, I had high expectations. I was expected to be scared to death by ruthless images of ghosts haunting a defenseless little kid. I also expected there not to be all the dialogue that there was, and more ghosts. After my first viewing, with my expectations lowered, I decided to wait a while to watch it a second time. I think it was a year before I actually bought the DVD (Not the Vista Series), and watched it again. And this time, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I enjoyed it for its depth, heart, and it's minimal -- yet effective -- scares. M. Night Shyamalan is a very creative and intelligent director, putting heart into his design. The use of the color red was a very unique touch. The main cast -- Haley Joel Osment (Cole), Bruce Willis (Malcolm), and Toni Collette (Lynn) -- were all superb. The relationships between Osment with both of the leads were great. Especially that of his and Collette (Cole's mother). Scenes with them were near tear-jerking at times.The Sixth Sense is an exceptionally scripted thriller / drama. Too bad it took me two viewings to realize that.

Folks, if you enjoy psychological thrillers and suspense films, this one will blow you  away! Not only does it have a great cast and plot, but the emotional impact  it leaves is quite impressing. Bruce Willis is a child psychiatrist trying  to help a  kid named Cole who has a deep secret he hasn't shared with  anyone yet-a secret he feels no one will understand. This secret is that he  sees dead people, walking amongst himself, not knowing they are dead. As  the truth behind his beliefs is pending, Malcolm (Bruce Willis) must try  trust Cole and make his nightmares go away. This film will leave you on the  edge of your seat from the odd beginning to the shocking conclusion, which  makes &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; a must-see.

The difference between the two is night and day.  Sixth Sense made me wonder how this wonderful movie would end.  AB made me  wonder WHEN this movie would end.

It is bad enough that my  children have to question me 15 times about &quot;when is the movie going  to start&quot; when I put their Little Mermaid video in the VCR; but  forcing me to watch previews on a DVD!  OUTRAGIOUS!  The DVD does not  let you select the audio track while the movie is playing.  Useful feature  to check the AC-3 setting.  Choices of languages?  English and French.  I  would have thought Spanish would have been a selection.  Also, the bonus  material should have been expanded and placed in a directors/actors sound  track.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AYP52ZXCRMA73	Jude	I can understand why this semi-intriguing but ultimately disappointing little flick caused so much hype. In comparison to the standard gore-filled, brain-dead fare such as the Scream trilogy and other  stinkers(oops, I mean &quot;thrillers&quot;) the Hollywood machine has  crammed down poor moviegoers' throats in the past decade, no wonder some of  us seem to think this is a cinematic tour de force. I really did want this  movie to live up to the hype but sadly, I was sorely disappointed.  Admittedly my standards are high, having been raised on such classics as  &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;Rear Window&quot;. Hitchcock did it better, he  knew how to shock and scare and just plain thrill the audience. The  &quot;surprise&quot; ending of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; was evident  after the first 15 minutes whereas, good old Hitch could leave the audience  hanging until the very end. Haley Joel Osment was cute in a Mikey-from the  &quot;Life&quot; cereal commercial-sort of way but the rest of the movie  fell flat.I left the movie feeling deflated and wishing I had spent my  money on a rental of a Hitchcock classic rather than sitting there watching  an unsuspenseful and pretty predictable offering from a genre which went  downhill after Hitchcock's death. Another visit to the Bates Motel would  have been more creepy than a little boy with puppy dog eyes that &quot;sees  dead people&quot;.	3.0	Eh. A decent effort that falls short.	2000-07-30	13	3	10

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A18BV4O63DOWNH	"""juno2"""	No point in belaboring the plot of  *The Sixth Sense*; just want to weigh in a year and a half later.The movie has a truly surprise ending, making you want to sit through it a second time.  The question is, of course, is the movie worth a second viewing?  It's arguable.  I watched it a second time not because of the ending but rather because of M. Night Shyamalan's surprisingly sure-handed direction  (it's only his second movie!).  The scene composition, art direction, lighting, and measured pace  (very pleasing, that)  are almost wonders to behold in this day and age of racking noise, &quot;kinetic&quot;  camerawork, and other excesses.  With a movie about ghosts, we've come to expect over-the-top shenanigans and scares that mainly come from sudden bleats of violins and synthesizers at 50-decibel volume in your typical Dolby-sound theater.  Shyamalan dares to take the genre pretty seriously, and he generates several legitimate scares.  The scares work because he's earned it.  The director has paid due attention to story and character development, and once the ghosts begin their visitations, we find ourselves concerned about the characters and really wishing that they don't come to harm.  (Typical slasher movies don't scare because we don't care -- about the characters, the story, the villain.)Along that vein, Shyamalan wrings excellent performances from his cast.  Joel Haley Osment has to be one of the discoveries of the decade, Toni Collette is, as always, great, and Bruce Willis has been restrained to the point where he actually stays in character.Not quite on the level of  &quot;great&quot;, *The Sixth Sense*  is nevertheless very promising work from a director I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more of.	3.0	Probably better than the other  &quot;Oscar&quot;  nominees of 1999.	2000-12-18	1	0	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1QHYYND7Q7ZOE	Justin Lowry	&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is a great ghost story with an excellent script by writer/director M. Night Shyamalan. Haley Joel Osment, as the sad, lonely Cole, gives probably the strongest acting of any child actor - ever. Toni Collette gives a strong performance as Cole's loving single mother.  Bruce Willis fits his role perfectly with a detached, quiet style of acting that not only works well in the watching of the movie but in light of the final plot twist. The cinematography and the musical score (by James Newton Howard) provide the perfect atmosphere: sad, dark, and ghostly. Unlike most movies these days that seem to be written for audiences with ADD, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; does not rush its pace but gives time for well-written dialogue. In the midst of the deluge of crap from Hollywood, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; shines as a beautiful exception filmed by a promising director.	5.0	An example of excellent writing, directing, and acting!	2000-10-04	10	8	2

The movie itself is very intriguing, but nothing can top Haley Joel Osmonds performance.  I know what your saying, yeah, you've heard that a million times.  It's the truth.

However, I failed to be stunned by the alleged twist within the film (which I will not reveal should any  purchasers not have seen this film). Maybe I'm just more attuned to these  things, but I thought that the 'twist' was so telegraphed at the beginning  of the film that I sat waiting at the end for another twist that did not  come (and this was going to the film 'blind' with no prior knowledge of  content from reviews, trailers or comments from others). I recommend that purchasers of  this film check out &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot;, also available from Amazon  on DVD and compare/contrast. So, a good film, but overhyped in my opinion.	3.0	Good film, but where's the twist?	2000-03-07	11	3	8

It's terrific; it cracks like a whip.  It's rather slow at the beginning (about the 2nd and 3rd sixths of the film, I'd say, plus  the opening credit-crawl, which is boring), but the acting is outstanding  and the music incredibly evocative and well-suited to the screen action.  I  was rather ho-hum about this film for most of the way through it; then I  quickly determined that it was imperative that a copy must adorn my  shelves.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2DQAK115I0NLT	ken	When i first saw this movie in theaters, i was scared and amazed, even when i saw it a second time in theaters, i was still amazed!  But, when it came out on dvd, i bought it and i was not as impressed with it on the tv for some reason, and i watched it on a BIG screen tv.  The theater does something to a movies scare factor, and this is a perfect example of that.  It is still a good movie with good acting by all, still pretty disturbing, still good story, and still sad in parts.  But, it was 10x better in theaters.  If you have not seen it at all yet, you will probably still get a good effect but, if you already have been told the ending, you won't get it all.  the ending has to be one of the biggest shockers that i have ever seen in a movie! 9 out of 10! reccommended!	4.0	better on the big screen	2000-10-06	1	1	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AVQHF3MX60UKC	kevhill@ministryofsound.net	"Undoubtedly one of the high points in 90's cinema, Night Shyamaln's third offering scores on so many fronts that in the final analysis it could well be vaunted as a future classic. Perhaps the most refreshing aspect of the  whole affair (aside from Willis actually delivering a solid performance  with real characterisation for once) is that this film chills so clinically  effectively without the need to rely on bulk-standard special effects. No,  this is creative filmmaking delivered with confidence and flair.  Willis is  noted child psychologist Malcolm Crowe who becomes involved with troubled  nine-year-old Cole Sear (played utterly superbly by Haley Joel Osment) who  is haunted by, apparently, visions of the dead. Slowly, step by step, Crowe  gets the boy to open up to him but the further he delves into the child's  psyche, the greater his suspicion the boy's problems are not merely an  unbalanced mental state.  As Crowe becomes ever more immersed with the  boy's progress so his marriage appears to suffer. The relationship he has  with his wife (Olivia Williams) becomes increasingly more strained since a  year previously when a disgruntled ex-patient shoots Crowe before turning  the gun on himself.  This underscore of tension heightens the sense of  frustration felt by Crowe in dealing with all aspects of his life. Also of  note are the various scenes between Willis and the boy's mother (Toni  Collette), who at one point has to suffer the shameful indignity of being  suspected as her child's abuser in response to part of the harrowing  nightmare the child is undergoing. Captivating stuff! Cinematographer Tak  Fujimoto makes great use of shadow and darkness throughout and scenes such  as where the boy is locked in a dark cupboard by errant ""friends"" truly  frighten, conjuring up and reminding us all of the fears of childhood. The  inclusion of the after-effects of a young girl slowly being poisoned by her  own mother is also shockingly horrific and lives in the memory for a long  time after.  Whilst the main structure of the story isn't particularly  outstanding, its given weight by sterling performances all round with top  honours going to Haley Joel Osment who delivers an outstanding performance  as the outcast, over-sensitive, tormented main subject. And the surprise  (as opposed to shock) ending is the icing on the cake and certainly wasn't  obvious to me. I've viewed this film in excess of a dozen times now, it's  that engrossing and I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying this is an  essential viewing/purchase.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1DHNC125851OZ	Kevin Alphonso	The first time that I saw &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, I saw it at a movie theater in October, with a friend of mine. I wasn't too crazy about the movie -- I thought it was slow, had dull characters, and felt  unfinished.I read the screenplay and, after enjoying it, made it a point  to see the film again. And I'm glad I did; this is a film that should be  seen more than once.I don't think you can appreciate it, unless you  understand that the movie's slow pace is intentional, and that everything  in the story happens for a reason and builds to something.This story,  about a terrified young boy who sees ghosts, and gets help from a child  psychologist, works very well. It moves slowly, but that just happens to  bring you into the story.As melodramatic as it sounds, this movie makes  you appreciate things in your life that you would normally take for  granted: a good family, love, peace, and simple communication.And that's  all that the movie really comes down to. And it does an amazingly heartfelt  job of emphasizing on these things, and how important they are to  us.This is an excellent movie and a very unique one, at that. If you  appreciate good storytelling, with morals that are not preachy or  patronizing, then this is one film that you really must own.	4.0	Try the &quot;Sense&quot; more than once	2000-06-10	2	1	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1DVRYNCJFPS8X	Kevin Lutes	I must admit that I was impressed by this movie.  I will not get into the plot because I do not want to give too much away and because you already know the basic setup, unless your dead yourself.  Movies that are as  popular as this one tend to be silly Hollywood action pictures, and I  worried that this would follow suit.  It did not.  Everyone talks about how  they loved the plot twist, and they are good, but what I loved the most is  that the story is taken seriously.  It is not often that a serious ghost  story is brought to the screen.  More often than not we have to put up with  the silly teen slasher movies that are not really scary at all.  I would  rank this film right up there with The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, and  Jacob's Ladder.  Even when I was younger I never understood why hollywood  did not make serious scary movies.  It is almost as if movie makers do not  believe in the supernatural themselves.  Actually I think that those  slasher movies are a lot easier to make than a convincing, mature ghost  story, and they make a lot of money.  I can only hope that the success of  this film convinces Hollywood that they can trust the audience with mature  matieral.	4.0	A more serious ghost story	2000-05-08	0	0	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A34PNHKNM05TXD	Kevin P. Westmoreland	I have to say that I saw this movie for the first time on DVD.  I had not heard the details of any of the twists and was pleased by how well the movie kept me engrossed enough not to figure out certain surprises.The  picture quality is excellent, with a great anamorphic transfer by Disney.  The sound is good, although this is a dialogue driven movie without much  deep bass or rear surround action.The trailers that you must go through  before the movie starts are very annoying and, unfortunately, a Disney  trademark on virtually all their video releases.  Whomever is in charge of  marketing for the video division is working overtime and must be  stopped.The DVD also includes a documentary on the making of the movie  which is a nice addition.  ONE WARNING - do not watch the documentary until  you have watched the movie.Haley Joel Osment is fantastic as the  troubled child, Bruce Willis does an outstanding job as the compassionate  and guilt-ridden doctor, and Toni Collete is excellent as Haley's on  -screen mom.  See if you recognize her from Muriel's Wedding or Emma.All  in all a very good DVD.  Now if we could just tone down Disney's sledge  hammer marketing approach, all would be good with the world.	4.0	Great movie, decent DVD package	2000-04-27	4	3	1
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A39RX8GDG1GU4	Kevin Wagner  (Kevin@scifiguys.com)	I'm not a big fan of horror, so I managed to avoid the &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; during it's theatrical run. I was going to avoid it entirely, but friends persuaded me to give it a try, and I'm glad they did.This is  a terrific picture that kept me thinking about it for days after I saw it.  The film stars an under-rated Bruce Willis as a psychiatrist who works with  traumatized young children. After having a traumatizing episode himself,  Willis attempts to right his own life by helping an unreachable young boy  named Cole, who is played by Oscar nominee Haley Joel Osment. However, Cole  is not your average troubled child. Cole, we quickly find out, sees and  talks to dead people. Fortunately, Willis is not your average psychiatrist,  either.There is a lot I would like to say about this movie, but little  more I can mention without spoiling it. I can tell you this film is not  particularly graphic or bloody, and my violence-averse wife enjoyed the  film. But it can be fairly frightening, especially for younger viewers. The  movie is more than your average thriller, and will keep you guessing.The  DVD has several great features on it, including scenes that were cut from  the film, and an interview with the director explaining some of the key  moments. That alone makes the DVD worthwhile.	5.0	Outstanding Film	2000-05-11	5	4	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L	"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip"""	This movie definitely surpassed my expectations.  Granted, my expectations weren't too high- I saw a matinee, just wanted it to be mildly entertaining. I had seen BWP a few weeks before at the time and had friends who said they almost cried BWP scared them so bad. Well, there's one of many moments in this (there's so many that just made every hair on my body stand on end, my skin crawl, and made me actually gasp- and I can say that I can probably only name 10 or scary movies that have 1 or 2 moments like that). I won't give the end of it away, but the moment that starts out with the kid appearing to Cole and whispering excitedly, &quot;Come on, I'll show you where my Dad keeps his gun&quot;- that one moment, to me, was 10 times scarier than all of the Blair Witch Project put together. There were many times where I jumped, and it wasn't just a &quot;fake&quot; jump, it was something clever that I genuinely didn't see coming. This was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands. It would definitely go on my top 5 scariest list, along with Carrie and The Exorcist.As far as the notorious plot twist, first of all, I've decided when it's hyped that a movie HAS a twist ending, that's a drag right there, because you-well, I do anyway--spend at least half the time trying to guess the twist. Having seen a hell of a lot of movies, and a hell of a lot of twists, I usually get it 9 times out of 10.) I'm pretty much the spoiler queen, it's like a drug or something, maybe 1% of the time I can resist reading them, I don't know what it is. Unfortunately, I read a review that gave it away without warning- it named a couple of movies (I won't name them, because it could give away the ending if you saw them) and said if you guessed the ending to those, you'll guess the ending to this. If I had to pick any movie where I could go back and not know the spoiler ahead of time, this would be it. My husband didn't see it coming, and he's pretty clever about guessing them too.Something else I did not see coming was how emotional this movie made me. Years ago I had a friend die on me without getting to say goodbye but I was over my grieving at the time I saw this...or so I thought.  My reaction makes me think I wasn't 100% over it. If you've seen the movie, you'll know why that hits you hard. If you've recently experienced the death of someone close to you (especially if you are not finished grieving) then in all seriousness, please think twice before you watch this movie. At the very least, see it with someone supportive who you are not afraid to get emotional in front of. During the second to last scene in the car, I surprised myself by starting to cry- not just getting choked up but actually crying to the point where I needed Kleenex-, and I didn't stop until the credits were part way over (and Bruce Willis is not one of my favorite actors). MAN that scene in the car got to me.Re-reading the screenplay, I realized even more how great it was, and how heartbreaking. There are so many elements that just make your heart wrench. I read the last scenes of the screenplay at home, alone, and had a really good cry, which hasn't happened since I read the screenplay to The Green Mile.Aside from that, again, this movie scared the you-know-what out of me. The premise is very scary but many filmmakers could have handled it in a way that bungled it up. In this movie, the filmmakers did it just right. Even if you *really* don't like Bruce Willis' acting, and were turned off by the trailer, give it a chance. But don't be surprised if you need to sleep with the light on.	5.0	One of the most frightening- and heartbreaking -movies made.	2000-10-31	0	0	0

It was also a scary film.  Now, you usually those two types of films don't cross with eachother, at least, not  since The Exorcist, but M. Night Shyamalan has created a masterpiece with  this film.  Bruce Willis has finally struck gold with his portrayal of Dr.  Malcolm Crowe.  Haley Joel Osment is one of the best child actors around.  Even better in this role than Linda Blair's role in The Exorcist, mainly  because they didn't result to the kid cursing like a sailor to bring depth  to the role.  He is the front-runner in my opinion for Best Supporting  Actor at this year's Academy Awards.  Oh, and don't pay attention to the  stories about Stir of Echoes and The Sixth Sense and that they were  competing with the same story.  These two films are nothing alike and they  are both equally good in their own right.  The Sixth Sense is just a little  better beacause of an extremely bright script and the famed  &quot;twist&quot; ending.  You'll love it.

It is so masterfully done with many layers, metaphysical, psychological, emotional, fabulous character and plot developments, that it lends itself quite well to viewing over and over again. Night Shyamalan, much like Quentin Tarantino did in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; has evoked a stellar performance from Bruce Willis, who is quite the underrated actor.  Pair him up with a child-genius actor as honest and believable as Haley Joel Osment (can you believe he was actually on the Jeff Foxworthy show at one point?!) and you've got an amazing acting ping-pong exchange of energy.  Toni Collette also delivers a wrenching portrayal of a mother at her wits end with her disturbed child. The film is chock-full of imagery and symbols, seemingly telling you one thing when in fact you've jumped to an erroneously conclusion, hence the much touted surprise twist at the end.

I liked the fact  that although the movie didn't really have any great special effect, it was  able to great a great creepy atmosphere.  Sure there are alot of cheap  shots to make you jump, and I'll admit that some of them actually worked  (when will I ever learn!), but I liked just being able to settle into the  creepy mood of the movie.  The music fits the movie very well and does  wonders to create the atmosphere.  Bruce Willis is very toned down in this  movie, but still does a very good job.  As everyone already knows, the real  star here is Haley Joel Osment, who makes you believe he is really this  scared, intelligent little boy who sees dead people.  The movie is great  and I love having it on DVD. There are some cool special features, I  personally like the deleted scenes and I don't see why some of them were  cut.  Anyways, if you liked the movie pick it up for sure!	4.0	Good Movie, Excellent DVD	2000-04-30	2	1	1
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AZ78HT7H9DVJG	LARRY	"I vividly remember the first time I saw this movie at the theatre.  I also remember the brilliance of the suspense and it just blew me away.Malcolm is an award-winning and recognized child psychologist.  After being shot by a former mentally-unstable client, Malcolm is determined to make sure that none of his clients ""fall through the cracks"".In comes Cole, a scared 9-year-old boy.  His mother has tried everything to help alleviate his fears but has not had any luck.  In the midst of their sessions and diagnoses, Cole reveals to Malcolm that he can see dead people.From there, we start to see from Cole's perspectives.  Indeed, he sees them but remains frightened of them.  Through the help of Malcolm, he realizes that the dead just simply want to communicate.  With his first mission being successful, Cole realizes that this is his purpose in life.  (In addition, I believe that this is where ""The Ghost Whisperer"" got their idea.)Overall, this is a fantastic movie.  The ending is mind-blowing that you'll want to watch the movie again.  M. Night Shyamalan did a superb job directing this movie.  He has mastered the art of getting our full attention into the story.  In addition, Haley Joel Osment is such a talented young actor.Once you've checked this out, you gotta watch ""The Others""."	5.0	want the 6th sense?	2007-11-29	0	0	0

First off, it was extremely difficult for me to watch because I understood exactly what the character Cole was going through and his fear is exactly what I've gone through. No, folks, I don't see dead people. If they're strong enough, I feel them. That unwanted ability makes me relate all the more to Cole's  fear of actually seeing dead people. Until I saw the rules and clues section of the DVD I had no clue that Bruce Willis' character was dead. It was an ingenious plot twist that I'll never tire of. Do I scoff at the other tricks some people might perceive the filmakers' playing on you? No. It happens. Those with open minds can enjoy this film. Those with preconceived expections that aren't met because of a closed mind look for things wrong. The key here is freeing yourself of preconceived notions about a very real topic. This film blew me away, which is the highest compliment I can give of an entertainment business that specializes in upchucking garbage to the masses.	5.0	Blew me away!	2005-12-07	3	2	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2GA6YYY23FNMW	Lee Anderson	The Sixth Sense is a movie that will grab you and pull you in, keeping you on the edge of your seat until the surprise ending that will leave you  stunned and speechless.  Not since the movie &quot;Seven&quot; has a  surprise ending completely shocked and moved me.  I had to see this movie  twice; once when I was entirely unaware what was going to happen and a  second time to see how the pieces truly fit. Bruce Willis, who does have a  tendency to pick typecast roles, gives an excellent performance as a child  psychiatrist fighting his own demons, and Haley Joel Osment is one of the  best child actors I have ever seen.  He played perfectly a kid who was  extremely frightened by what he saw, but who tried to remain strong for the  sake of his mother.  This movie is thrilling and frightening, and at the  same time very moving, especially with the relationship between Osment and  his mother.  This is definitely a movie to own.	5.0	The Best Thriller I've Seen in a Long Time	2000-02-11	0	0	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3VYDLL7WN5ZCM	Lee	The artwork for this movie claims The Sixth Sense is 'the #1 thriller of all time'. Quite where that came from I don't know. While the box-office may have had something to do with it, the actual movie itself is nowhere  near as good as the hype makes out.  The plot is simple: weird kid sees  ghosts and uses his powers to help them. Harvey Joel Osmont and Bruce  Willis do put in superb performances but even so, this movie is only  mediocre. The budget seems to have been blown on hiring Bruce Willis. What  was left was spent on makeup for the two or three ghosts we see. This movie  isn't for me - it's too slow and I didn't find it frightening or  interesting - but I can see that some people might like it. My advice would  be to rent it before you buy it. The DVD is very good, with lots of  worthwhile extras. The director says in one of the interviews that the  biggest audience was 'young boys and older women'. Perhaps a movie only for  the spiritually minded among us.  The huge box office takings can only  really be because of the surprise ending. It really isn't as clever as has  been made out. The plot twist was obvious to me right from the second or  third scene. Without the plot twist, I doubt anyone would have gone to see  this movie.  This movie is not a terrible film; just mediocre. I was  expecting more, and unfortunately it didn't deliver.	2.0	Mediocre movie, well overrated.	2000-07-17	8	4	4

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2BA9AO95K32Q1	Len Feder	I'm giving this film three stars because it held my interest from start to finish and because the ending had a very good twist.  Like The Usual Suspects (which is a five star movie, as good as the classics, in line for  best of its genre of all time), we get a wonderful twist at the end which  completely changes the entire movie's meaning, back to the beginning.  But  this one isn't as compelling and doesn't stand up to intelligent analysis.  Let's say you are a ghost, okay?  Let's say you don't know it.  Do you  think maybe, just maybe, you would notice that nobody else sees you?  There  are ghosts in this movie, and at least one of them doesn't realize that  people don't even see him or her.  Hello?  I have to hand it to Bruce  Willis - he picks good scripts.  It's not that he seems like the greatest  actor of all time, but when you hear that he is in a movie, you know that  it will be a movie with some quality.	3.0	Interesting, if not wholly reasonable	2000-06-11	2	1	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3382EAJAFG0CR	"""lex_of_the_cherubum"""	I was surprised when I first heard the rave reviews and witnessed how much money this film was making... it seems to me, that it would've been much more a &quot;sleeper&quot; The reason is that, compared to most  horror/pyschological horror films, this movie is &quot;slow&quot;. It moves  more like a 3-hour long movie, than an hour and a half or so, and it  contains only sparesly, albeit well-placed, bits of gore. On the whole, the  violence in this movie is only included to tell a story, not give a cheap  thrill. For this reason, and because it seems to me to be a sensitive,  thoughtful look at the possible existense of &quot;ghosts&quot;, I highly  recommend this movie. If movies were assigned personalities, and if  &quot;ET&quot; was cutsie, and &quot;Exorcist&quot; was loud and profane,  then &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; by M. Night Shyamalan is quiet, pensive,  brooding and clever.As for Haley Joel Osment, the 12 year old who plays  9-year-old Cole Sear... there is only one word to describe his acting  abilities: AWESOME. Never, and I mean never, have I come across a youngster  who is as capable of giving such a realistic performance, and of  influencing the mood of the audience to such a degree. Haley has a way of  claiming the screen, and is coupled well with a quickly-maturing Bruce  Willis, who was darkly-mysterious as the tenacious, caring child  psychologist, Malcolm Crowe.By now, you probably know that this movie is  about a young boy who has the very-real ability to &quot;see&quot; dead  people. Consequently, if a child really was capable of seeing such things,  they would be terribly frightened and probably give the impression that  something is very wrong, without necessarily stating what the problem is.  This is where Malcolm comes into the picture... he wants to  &quot;help&quot; Cole because, at the beginning of the movie, Cole appears  to be living the life of an emotionally abused child. And also... Cole  represents the chance to 'redo' the past; a past that has one, rather  large, error in it for Malcolm (one of his patients had a mental breakdown  and committed suicide, after shooting Malcolm in the solar plexus).Even  if you don't think this movie will satisfy your need for constant 'blood,  gore and shocks', see it anyway. It is almost a calming experience, when  compared to the gaudy, LOUD horror movies that are flooding the market,  and, to me, a welcome change.Congratulations, Bruce and Haley, on this  awesome landmark film!	5.0	This is what defines Excellence!	2000-01-21	33	27	6
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A32AHL4QO77OMR	Lex Preistner	Most horror movies, while I still continue to watch them, don't exactly captivate me and pull me into the story. The Sixth Sense most definately did, and I'm not just saying that to be like everybody else. Haley Joel Osment is an excellent young actor, and Willis is in top form in this flick. He handled an intelligent, sensitive role better than I ever thought possible, and Haley, well... Haley is already an icon of precocious youth. Because these actors were well-suited to their roles, the film is smooth and progresses naturally, without feeling rushed or pushed. I also liked the fact that Shyamalan didn't overuse the gore and ghosts aspect of the movie, for that would've quickly desensitized me. Instead, he placed the ghosts sparingly, at parts in the movie when they would create the most uproar amongst the audience. James Newton Howard is also an excellent composer and the score of Sense is haunting and lilting without being jolting.If you haven't seen it yet, please do. There is a very definate reason it was pegged the #1 thriller of all time, and the academy (in my opinion) must've been out of their minds not to award this superlative endeavor	5.0	The best ghost movie of all time!	2001-02-25	5	4	1
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A26U7YHCBZHO6M	lfratan@acad.udallas.edu	The Sixth Sense is severely flawed.  First, there is no resolution.  The boy presumably will continue to see  (sometimes gruesomely injured)  dead people.  The boy says they don't know they're dead...but...umm...surely the  hanged people, who are shown not screaming or anything, know...So little  Cole will spend his life seeing grisly broken bodies.  But hey, he knows  all they want is help!  The scene with the poisoned girl is underdeveloped  and rushed...compared to the slow, slow pace of other stuff.  The  &quot;rules-clues&quot; section talks about red...sure, red is used a lot.  That's about it.  It's a film with lots of red.  Nothing very creative or  special there.  There's a blooper when the wife's boss leaves her apartment  and is heard saying  &quot;See you two later&quot;...clearly a blooper.

When I was barely twelve years old, I somehow managed to see The Exorcist and The Shining. I'm pretty sure the scars are still carved into my psyche :). So when The Sixth Sense came out, as intriguing as it seemed, I stayed away. But when it earned its way onto the #89 spot of the revised AFI Top 100 listing, I knew I'd have to get through it somehow. So I curled up with a blanket, my boyfriend, a glass of wine, and watched.There were definitely some ""jump"" scenes in there, but by and large the movie is beautifully crafted with psychological, not gory, intrigue. Haley Joel Osment proves that a child actor can be superb. As a fan of Philip K. Dick stories, I adored the twists and turns, the unexpected and the layers. Bruce Willis shines as a man with issues.It's definitely a movie that you want to avoid all previews of, so that you don't know what is coming. A key part of the movie is watching the story unravel and make more sense as time goes on. It's also a movie that gets better with each re-watching, where you can appreciate the use of light, the use of color, and the fine acting.It's a bit disappointing that even in modern times that movies often seem to be all about men in a man's world. Yes, there's the mother who adores her son and just wants to help him. But she's pretty much the only woman in the entire movie. The only time two women talk to each other in the entire film, except one brief moment at a birthday party, is when a mom briefly talks with her daughter about going outside to play. That's it. Apparently the rest of the population of our world is made up of silent females and quite talkative males.Still, I suppose it's better than other movies on the AFI Top 100 like Patton and 12 Angry Men which literally have zero speaking females at all :).Highly recommended, even if you don't normally watch thrillers. This is one that well deserves its AFI spot."	5.0	Superb Story Telling	2012-09-04	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2PEK2Z86ZMG7V	Lizzardbreath	"""The #1 Thriller of all time!"" is how the movie, The Sixth Sense, is advertised.  But is ""thriller"" the best way to describe this story?  Certainly there are many shocking, startling scenes.  However, the story seems to be more of a psychological journey, colored with melancholy and sadness than most thrillers.  Granted, The Sixth Sense has many scenes that employ ""scary graphics"".  But these graphics look like they were designed by a seven-year-old.  And does the movie fit within the thriller genre when it does not have chase scenes?  The closest scene would be Malcolm walking after Cole when he had missed an appointment!  Not exactly startling or thrilling.Although we have had this movie for a couple of years, I had not watched it until October 29, 2005 because my little brother kept telling me how terrifying it was.  I found it intriguing, but was surprised that it did not frighten me more.  I even watched it again on Sunday the 30th so that I could go through and look for slip-ups on the whole ""Malcolm is a Ghost"" idea.The over-riding idea within this movie of Malcolm not knowing he is a ghost carried a solid emotional punch.  I found myself afraid that Malcolm's wife, Anna, was cheating on him and no longer loved him.  The director, M. Night Shymalyan, did an excellent job of masking what the truth was and because of this, when it all became clear at the end, it was even more tragic.  Throughout the movie Malcolm was under the impression that his wife was leaving him, but in fact he was the one to have left her!  He had displayed all of the symptoms of a ghost throughout the movie, but because he had been presented as a living therapist, him being a ghost was not evident.  The clues were not something that the viewer would focus on until the end of the movie when Malcolm remembers what had happened the night that he was shot.I love the scene where he realizes that it was never his wife's fault that she was not talking to him, but that she was in fact still very devoted to him.  She repeatedly watched the video of their wedding, and went back to the restaurant he had proposed to her in.  It is a powerful scene when Malcolm comes to understand that the loneliness that he feels is about a hundred times worse for Anna because she cannot see, hear, or smell his presence any more.  She just gets cold when he is angry.The graphics in this movie were simplistic and unimpressive.  Scary scenes were often blurred and bloody wounds were lavishly covered in fake blood.  For instance when Malcolm is shot, the camera zooms in on a clean bullet hole through the his shirt and then a growing blood stain on his back - not exactly high tech.  It was evident that a hole punch was used for the shirt, with an extreme close-up to make it look bigger than it actually was, and then fake blood from a pump was used to make it look like progressive bleeding.  In the scene where Vincent kills himself, they simply move him out of the range of the camera!  All that is heard is a gunshot and icky, squishy sounds.  And then there is the makeup used for each of the ghosts to show bruises and wounds that looked fake.  When the back of the young boys head was blown off it looked like strawberry jelly slathered in his hair.  And when the little girl ghost was throwing up it looked like oatmeal with yellow food coloring in it.  The graphics seemed absurd and predictable to me and therefore, not very scary.Unlike most thrillers, this movie carries sweet over-tones.  The child, Cole, who has the sixth sense, is successful at maintaining his innocence no matter how horrific the ghost scenes are.  And when Cole finally tells his mother his big secret, that he sees dead people, it does not make her look at him any differently.  She loves him just the same as she always has.Although I believe that the genre this movie was placed in was ill suited, it is still on my small list of favorite movies.  It contains messages of love and the need to understand others within the context of their lives.  Because of this, I will watch it over and over."	4.0	"""The #1 Thriller Of All Time""...Yeah, Right!

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AYZLXLVMJGTJV	L. J Nary	The sixth sense had clues that would trigger you to know what was happening and one of them was the color red, this is for those of you who haven't seen the talk after the movie with M. Night. Whenever any strong emotion was about to occur there would always the color red somewhere in the scene, the doorknob, the balloon, the wife's sweater, etc. Just a bit of trivia to know before you watch the movie. If you have not heard of the ending to this movie, be prepared for a surprise! This movie twists back and forth, making pretty good sense along the way. The only thing I didn't much care for, is how they made Osmet's character into the popular kid at the end and the popular kid the dork, it just seemed to cliched and not realistic. I don't understand how a kid who was in a commercial and was ego-ridden, not Osmet's character but the popular kid character could act so awful in the school play at the end. This did not seem feasible and did not match the tone of the rest of the movie which was intelligent and fit together quite nicely. Maybe Night had an experience with this and wrote from that place when he wrote the play scene near the end of the movie. The acting is really good, especially Toni Collete. I could watch her again and again, she is a great actress. She plays alot of quirky offbeat roles, I've seen her in a few that are not available or if so, not easy to find, one is Boys and the other was Hotel ??? Forgot the name, saw it at a film fest and really liked it, very bizzare. The movie is a must see! As M. Night said it was a cultural phenomenan, it affected alot of people, just that alone may prompt you to see it. The scary parts aren't that bad, the suspense can be difficult, but it is nothing like the Exorcist has a good theme tied in with the side most people would assume to be dark, watch it and see!Lisa Nary	5.0	Watch out for the color Red!	2002-03-08	1	0	1

Bruce Willis is a pediatric psychologist,  Dr. Malcolm Crowe, who is haunted by the sudden reappearance and then a dramatic suicide of a former patient.  He was planning on spending a romantic evening with his wife, in celebration of his recent civic honor as a upstanding Child Psychologist.Months later we see Dr. Crowe meeting a 6 year old boy,  Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment).  He has been withdrawn and has some mental issues.  He is also has issues very similar to his earlier patient.Dr. Crowe then begins to talk with Cole, for both to gain peace in their lives. The issues with Cole are complicated and Dr. Crowe struggles to figure out what Cole is not telling him or his single mother.  It seems during the counseling he has focused on Cole and left his wife out emotionally.  The relationship with his wife seems odd and distant.A riveting scene where Cole finally tells Dr. Crowe about his frightening supernatural secret is exquisitely engrossing.The stunning ending leaves your mouth gaping with surprise.The Oscar nominations for the amazing Osment and his deeply loving mother, Collette are well deserved.

He has studied the masters well, and has a humanity sorely needed in cinema.  SENSE is compelling and spooky, but it's Osment that  makes the film fly.  The film leaves one with a haunting poignancy, thanks  to M. Night's restrained direction, the ensemble's acting, and Newton  Howard's score.  Films such as SIESTA (1987), AN OCCURRENCE AT OWL CREEK  BRIDGE (1959?) and JACOB'S LADDER (1986) have explored this territory with  different results, and more than a smidgen has been borrowed from Roeg's  DON'T LOOK NOW (1973).	4.0	CLEVER REHASH OF PRIOR GEMS SUCCEEDS WELL	2000-06-16	6	4	2
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A21G1HKUQPHFKI	"Luis M. Ramos ""Soundtrack and Film Freak"""	&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is probably the best film of 1999.  It's a movie that tells the story of Cole Sear (beautifully played by Haley Joel Osment), a child with an unusual -and definitely scary -ability of seeing dead people that don't accept that they are not among the living anymore.  As psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe, Bruce Willis plays someone who goes beyond his &quot;Die Hard&quot; character.  The relationship between these two gives one of the strong points of this film.Another strong point -and I believe Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of it -is the twist at the end of the movie.  It is very unexpected.  Don't let anybody tell you.  All you have to do is sit back and enjoy the film, even though you may be in for some chills.And since I am reviewing this movie on the DVD format, I've got to tell you that the extras on this edition are terrific, with deleted scenes, and some behind-the-scenes featurettes.  Personally I like the interview to composer James Newton Howard regarding how he created the music to fit in the scary environment of the movie.Buy it.  You won't regret it.	5.0	Let's See Dead People	2000-11-21	2	0	2
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A29D83NKRLFA34	Luke McCall	I see a lot of people saying that this was the greatest film of 1999, but let's be honest. With equally amazing films, like American Beauty, The Cider House Rules, The Green Mile, I'd say The Sixth Sense is one of MANY great films of 1999. Let's not forget that 1999 was also the year of Fight Club and The Matrix. And, hell, for a great B-movie, I'd say Galaxy Quest really put a cap on the fact that 1999 was one of the greatest years for movies, period.	5.0	Let's be honest	2013-10-28	3	2	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A17NVM7IAPF2NS	Maek	Whereas Unbreakable was a study of how a superhero might develop in a real world setting, The Sixth Sense delves into the possibility that those we consider to be insane may not necessarily be.Consider a youth so tormented by &quot;mysterious voices&quot; SUPPOSEDLY coming from the dead that he is eventually driven insane. Insane to the point that he comes back to murder the child psychiatrist (played by Bruce Willis) who tried to help him. And later, this same psychiatrist attempts to help another child (Haley Joel Osment) whom he comes to realize has the same problem.Consider, then, what happens in a real world setting when someone DOES actually hear voices from the dead? How do we treat these individuals? This movie is a perfect rendition of this; we would normally be compelled to believe that someone is mentally unstable...who truly knows in the end?This movie is rich in its depth and breadth of character and humanity. For it takes someone who IS dead to realize that a child CAN listen to the dead--and it is extremely ironic to think that a psychiatrist, armed with this knowledge, is unable to share this information with the world. However, the movie shines a hopeful light since he is now capable of helping this child!Granted, on a base level of story, this one is a ripping good yarn with a wonderful surprise ending, but it's also stunning if one sits back and realizes the complexity of issues surrounding those we label &quot;insane.&quot;	5.0	Truly insane?	2001-07-12	1	0	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3NM0RAYSL6PA8	"Maine Writer ""David"""	Frankly, I have never seen a movie so misinterpreted by critics.  That is, in part, the fault of its writer/direct M. Night Shamalyan.  The Sixth Sense is a movie of separate, yet self-contained and authentic levels.  On the surface, it is an effective ghost story in the truest sense, drawing on a long tradition of tales and with an ending that is both rewardingly unique and also of a kind with some of classic tales of haunting.  (The Others, with Nicole Kidman, tries to pull off a similar effect, but falls woefully short.  The Others is a nice enough film, but nothing more.  In comparison, The Sixth Sense is as well-realized a film as I have ever seen.)  Okay, then, so what is the other layer of this film?  In my view, the power of this film is in its less obvious message:  it is a haunting, evocative, and cautionary tale about middle age.  About how easily we become the walking dead.  In our work.  In our relationships.  Bound as we are in routine and rote, we see only what we want to see.  We neglect those that are closest to us.  We sleepwalk through life.  And when those we care about truly die, we awaken just long enough to be filled with regret.  This emotional undercurrent builds and builds and finds its release in several key moments.  You'll know them by the uncharacteristically powerful emotions they evoke--the depth of which could only be achieved by this striking psychological tale so nicely concealed in a story of the supernatural.  This is a very, very special film.	5.0	Who, exactly, are the dead people?	2002-02-07	0	0	0

Night Shyamalan graced theatergoers with this icy ruby of movie magic. And although he has made worthy follow-ups in the years since, for me, he's never topped THE SIXTH SENSE.Malcolm Crowe is a child psychologist tormented by the one patient he couldn't save. It's been a year since he had to confront that awful truth, and in that time, his confidence and his marraige have undergone a slow and steady crumble that has finally reached the breaking point. Enter Cole Sear, an eight year old child of a single mother with a decidedly nasty neurosis: he believes he sees the dead.If Crowe (Bruce Willis) can help the boy (Oscar-nominee Haley Joel Osment), he may just redeem himself; but the effort he spends in doing so continues to erode his relationship with his wife, and a nagging suspicion that Cole is NOT delusional threatens Crowe's fundamental understanding of the universe.This is a terrific thriller-ghost-story-drama that would suffer from any further explanation. Great acting and subtle direction (note the selective usage of the color red), along with an absolutely killer storyline, make THE SIXTH SENSE probably the best movie of 1996. Eleven years later, it still holds up.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire novel ""Teeth: A Horror Fantasy."")"	5.0	An Original, Horrifying, Dramatic Debut	2007-08-25	2	1	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A17KOZD9ACHPOH	"Marie Finn ""Marie"""	"In The Sixth Sense, the color red represents sanctuary and a sense of feeling safe, as well as a sign of fear because the use of red with Cole signifies his wanting to be safe from the ghosts, and because the red also shows the first signs of ghosts and fear. Furthermore, the use of red throughout the movie gives certain hints to the fact that something happened.Being a young boy who sees ghosts can be terrifying. The sense of feeling safe could be extremely hard to find, especially if the ghosts appear at anytime. Cole, the boy, is left with only his mother after his parent's divorce. This seems to be the main problem, but later on in the movie, we realize that it's not that at all. Cole sees dead people. These ghosts scare him so he finds places where he feels safe. He often goes into the church, which has bright red doors. In the church, he plays by himself and stays there as often as he can. He also steals a small statue of Jesus, who is wearing a red robe. This stands out because the Jesus is the only statue wearing red. He then takes it back to his house, where he has a red fort in his room made out of blankets. Inside the tent, he has many figurines of Jesus and crucifixes. He feels that the fort is his sanctuary from the ghosts.Dr. Crow, played by Bruce Willis, is a child psychologist who tries to help Cole through his problems. Once a bond is formed between Cole and Dr. Crow, Cole tells him his secret of seeing ghosts. Dr. Crow is skeptical of this, of course, but later finds similarities between Cole and an old patient of his. He finds that not only is Cole telling the truth, but his past patient also had the ""sixth sense"" of seeing the dead. Dr. Crow finds his sanctuary in the basement of his house. In the basement, he holds all this past records of old patients, and does research in order to help Cole. Oddly enough, the door to the basement is all white, but the doorknob is red. This stands out against the white and shows that the basement is where he feels safe and where he can find some answers.Even though red symbolizes the feeling of being safe, it also shows fear and the first signs of ghosts. Cole doesn't fit in and he realizes this. He dreads going to school everyday. The school is painted red, and shows his fear of not fitting in, and also shows that maybe something happened earlier there. Later on, Cole tells us that the school used to be an old courthouse where they hung people. He knows this because he sees ghosts hanging from the ceiling. Dr. Crow talks to Cole about his problems and asks him if he ever writes upset words. These are words that come randomly that one just writes downs without knowing what they are writing. Cole has done this, and it shows the writings that he did, which are in red ink. Throughout the movie, Anna, Dr. Crow's wife, seems very distant from him. He finds pills in the bathroom that are for depression. He has no idea what is going on, but the pills are red, which can symbolize her inner fear of losing him. Red can either show fear or sanctuary.The use of red also shows that something happened that the audience isn't aware of. For instance, a young girl visits Cole and wants to tell him to give her father a box. Cole and Dr. Crow went to the girl's funeral to find that the mother of the girl was keeping her sick. When the mother is first shown, she is wearing a bright red dress at a funeral. She stands out against all the black. This shows that there is something going on that the audience doesn't know about.The Sixth Sense is a great movie that has plenty of twists and turns that keeps the audience hooked from the opening scene. If you're a person who wants to be able to sit there and think about everything you just saw when the movie is over, then The Sixth Sense is the right movie for you."	4.0	The Sense of Symbolism (spoilers)	2005-12-14	3	2	1

Although I felt the very opening scenes were a little flat, at least until the appearance of Donnie Wahlberg in a role that definitely goes against type, but most of the rest of the movie rings true.  There are some genuine &quot;made you jump!&quot; scenes, but the horror here is mostly psychological.  My favorite scene:  the camera holding steady on Willis's face as Osment reveals more and more of his secret and watching the terror sink in.  It's not hard to see why this is one of the biggest box-office hits ever.  Willis, never my favorite actor, is solid, and avoids the smarminess that sometimes defeats his natural charm, and of course Osment is at times heartbreakingly earnest in his portrayal of the boy.  This movie isn't going to change your life, but it will entertain the hell out of you for a few hours.	4.0	Clever, Well-Crafted Thriller	2001-07-09	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3K8ZU4OEZONJL	Mark	Bruce Willis turns in his best performance yet as a child psychologist helping a young boy (Forrest Gump's son -- a talented young actor, whatever his name is) deal with his &quot;sixth sense,&quot; an ability to see dead  people. The boy is a strange genius and the psychologist a tortured  workaholic, forever changed after a former patient made an attempt on the  good doctor's life before taking his own. Seeking redemption for failing to  cure the gunman, the doctor tries to help the haunted boy discover why the  ghosts come visiting and how to send them on their way.This intelligent  suspense thriller becomes one of the greats by tapping into your psyche and  plucking nerves with startling effectiveness -- rather than bludgeoning  your head with blood and gore until all five conventional senses are  blunted. The ghost sightings are occasional and relatively subtle overall,  leaving you on the edge until finally seeing them in full force sets off an  adrenaline rush hard enough to knock you out of your seat. By seeing the  apparitions through the young boy's eyes we become fearful little children  watching our nightmares come true even as we huddle with the protagonist  under a tent of bedsheets with a flashlight. Intelligent writing and sharp  cinematography create an eerie atmosphere that carries all the way through  to a surprise twist at the end. It's just ... exquisite.PS: If you like  this, try &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot; with Kevin Bacon. Same basic theme,  except Bacon's character ends up with 'the gift.' Came out a couple months  behind &quot;Sixth Sense.&quot; Much darker, not quite as good, still  worthwhile.	5.0	Hauntingly Original Thriller Masterpiece	2000-02-10	1	1	0

The ending is a jaw-dropping shocker that will leave you babbling and reconstructing the movie long into the night.But no one should be mislead into believing ""The Sixth Sense"" relies on that final revelation. The movie succeeds just fine the way the story develops before that final scene.The magic of the movie is that it defies classical description. It's a horror movie, sure. There are moments in the film that will inspire genuine unease in even the most hardened horror fanatic. There are moments that bring you right out of your seat. There is no doubt that ""The Sixth Sense"" is a scary movie. Any place populated by the unsettled dead is going to be an uncomfortable spot to reside.Yet, none of the spooks in the movie are added gratuitously. The appearance of each new dead man, woman or child is a natural development as the story unfolds. There is fright on the screen because the little boy's world is filled with a day-to-day horrors with whom few adults could ever cope.Haley Joel Osment shows genius well beyond his years in this performance. You love the kid from the start because he is small, and vulnerable and seeking only the most basic sense of safety and comfort. Yet, it soon becomes apparent that there is a giant strength to the boy, as he goes to bed each night faced with a gift that bring terrors to him so unspeakable, the average person could not bear it. The average person would be carried away shrieking and insane to spend his days and nights sedated in a well-padded room. The boy's plight and his unbearable sensitivities result in scenes that are as touching and sad as they are frightening.The concept of this movie is so unique, it seems unfair to call it a variation of the classic ghost-medium story. The boy sees dead people, it's true. But the heart of the story is in the discovery of why that is so. And that discovery causes great distress for the movie watcher, who wants to slap Bruce Willis around a few times, shake him, and scream at him to listen to the boy.Willis' character is, of course, flawed himself. He has to battle with his own shortcomings and self-doubts before he can open himself up completely to the boy. The chillingly whispered line: ""I see dead people"" is not enough to convince a career psychologist that dead people are, in fact, afoot.This is a movie that is firmly placed in the top three of my all-time favorites. Another viewing or two, and it could handily topple the rest and stand at number one.From start to finish, ""The Sixth Sense"" is an amazing movie on almost every level. Filming, mood and acting are all there in near perfection. The story itself transcends the rest of it. The twist at the end? Beautiful, but mere gravy."	5.0	I love the dead	2006-04-26	4	3	1

When I first saw it, I was told what the twist ending was, and was still surprised by the ending when I saw it myself.  The story was very well-written, and aside from a few  very minor nit-picks (mainly regarding shadows and substance . . .) the  plot was flawless.  The DVD has so many extra-special features, including  (the writer/director) Night's first attempt at a horror film, which is  priceless!  Also a good feature:  Rules and Clues.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	ARXU3FESTWMJJ	"Mary Jo Sminkey ""15 years of Amazon Reviews!"""	First, the movie. Definitely 5 stars, this is one of the best scary movies I've watched. Haley Joel is just incredible, I am more impressed by his performance every time I see it. What a shame he did not win an Oscar for this movie, I guess they just couldn't bear to give it to a kid. But boy, he sure makes this movie great. Bruce Willis as well does a great job, certainly his best role to date. All the cast was wonderful, and the story extremely well written, perfectly paced and with a wonderful surprise ending. I particularly like this movie as it didn't go out of its way to use blood and gore to scare you, it did it with a buildup of suspense and mainly through the terror and fear of the characters themselves. Excellent.Now, for the DVD. I love a DVD with plenty of extra material, and this one certainly has that. Always fun getting to watch scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor, and Night's first movies were a riot. Other extra like an interview with the directory and the making of the movie help round out a nice selection of extra features on the great DVD.	5.0	Superb movie and a great DVD	2000-10-13	3	3	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AS7B4W4KOPQNV	Matteo	Recently, all the horror movies that have been coming out are filled with gore instead of horror.  The thing I like about this film, is that it focuses more on the horror, and delivers some great performances.  It is about a child psychologist(Bruce Willis) who's family has been pretty awkard ever since he had a patient come to his house and shoot himself.  When he meets a new child, Cole, he feels a special connection with him because he reminds him a lot of the patient that killed himself.  Later, Malcom (Willis) discovers that Cole has a dark secret that has been haunting him.  This movie was very entertaining and chilling. Any horror fan should go out and rent this today!	5.0	Great Horror Film!	2002-07-11	1	0	1
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A11072SXE707QO	Matt	As a child psychologist, Dr. Malcom Crowe (Bruce Willis) spends his time studying children in need of aid. One particular child strikes him as particularly peculiar, as Crowe soon discovers of the eight year old's amazing and chilling sixth sense.I, myself, saw The Sixth Sense in the theatre and was lucky enough not to have any of the movie spoiled for me. The plot is thick and intense throughout the entire film. Every single actor plays an amazing role in this movie. Willis is said to be at his best. Osment and Collette were nominated for Academy Awards from this particular film. And the ending... ooh, the ending. It was absolutely spectacular.The DVD features included were pretty decent. I suppose the deleted scenes are the best part. And there is a really friggin cheesy movie Shyamalan made when he was an aspiring director.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	The Sixth Sense is not my favorite ghost story on film, but it ranks third behind Roman Polanski's 1968 masterpiece, Rosemary's Baby, and a 1980 Canadian treat with George C. Scott called The Changeling. Did it deserve to get six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture? Heaven knows! I have recently begun an in-depth study of the Academy Awards, and my initial conclusion is that what wins and what's nominated is based primarily on the voters' collective mood in any given year. Especially their collective political mood. This translates to what we thought all along. The five nominees in a category are not necessarily the best in their field that year. So you must decide for yourself.Take the best acting categories. Toni Colette and Haley Joel Osment were among the nominees in the supporting category. Bruce Willis was, as always, omitted. Maybe Willis is unpopular among his peers. I'm sure he used to be. He was nominated for an Emmy for Moonlighting three years in a row, and won once. He certainly is one of the public's favorites. The Blockbuster Entertainment Awards manumitted him in 1998, 1999 and 2000. He won in 1999. He also took home the prize at the 2000 People's Choice Award. This ranks him above even Tom Hanks in the opinion of the people who pay to see movies. I am writing this because I think he is the most underrated actor of our times. He is understated and has a dignity that is rare. Without him, The Sixth Sense, Pulp Fiction, Twelve Monkeys, Die Hard, The Verdict and a dozen other movies would not have been the same.Willis is Malcolm Crowe in The Sixth Sense. He's a respected child psychologist. In a confrontation with a former patient, Crowe is shot. He realizes that he utterly failed this man. A few months later, he meets a young boy with problems very similar to the ex-patient. The boy is Cole Sear [Haley Joel Osment]. He is withdrawn, quiet, and scared of his own shadow. His Mother, Lynn [Toni Colette] helps him in the only way she knows how - with love. As Crowe gets to know Cole, he increasingly feels he can't help him, but something urges him not to give up. At the same time, Crowe fears that his spending so much time with his new patient is a main reason his once loving wife has grown distant. He suspects her of having an affair. The only other thing about the plot I'll tell you is that what makes Cole so fearful is that he thinks he sees dead people. If you don't know the story by now, you'll ruin much of the fun and suspense if you ask others to tell you more. You've been warned!Toni Colette gives her best performance since Muriel's Wedding, a nifty Australian comedy that I highly recommend. Still, it is eleven-year old Osment who is so amazing. There have been many great child actors, but if there has been one better than this kid, I can't think who it might be. He's so good, he's a bit spooky himself. I've seen a dozen interviews with him, and in every one, it's like watching and listening to a miniature thirty-year old. If there are others in his generation similar to him, then we are in for a movie renaissance in ten years or so. And Willis? This supposedly conceited star aids and abets Osment's performance. The usual route when dealing with a precocious child actor is to be condescending. At no time does Willis do this. He is, as always, dignified, and as a result of the way he interprets Malcolm Crowe, he gives us his finest performance to date.There is something quite telling about the public's reaction to The Sixth Sense. There could have been lavish special effects here, but director M. Night Shyamalan chose to avoid all but the simplest of them. Instead, he concentrates on the story. He lets his actors act. He assumes the audience is, on the whole, intelligent. That audience made it one of the highest grossing movies of all time.	5.0	One creepy and suspenseful thriller	2002-03-19	4	3	1
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3P7GYZQXT0QNK	Matthew Murray	The Sixth Sense is one movie that draws you into its web, and won't let you out until you've devoted a lot of mental time and energy to it.  I'm not, however, sure all the work is richly rewarded.  Haley Joel Osment and  Toni Collette give powerful performances, but Bruce Willis's central  performance is lacking, and drags most of his scenes down with it.  The  movie feels like it truly needed a much stronger actor and a more  compelling presence at its core, and it would really have given the movie  much more emotional weight.  The DVD version includes some great extras,  and is a must-have for every movie enthusiast.  The VHS version, missing  the additional enhancements, is still worthwhile, but not essential.  Regardless, The Sixth Sense is still entertaining, and worth sitting  through once or twice, but probably not much more.	4.0	Compelling and thought-provoking, but flawed.	2000-07-25	0	0	0

Nonetheless Malcolm is unprepared to learn the truth of what haunts Cole: terrifying, unwanted visits from the restless inhabitants of the spirit world. The movie will make you jump as the plot unveils. It has a twist at the end that surprised many although the restaurant scene didn't mesh with the twist and might have given it away.

I saw it in the dollar theatre in early 2000 and was totally taken away by it.  The tone, score, screen play, and acting are all supurb.The only bad thing is that M. Night Shyamalan set the bar so high with his first major film, that every movie he has made since has suffered by comparison.The DVD has some really great special features, the best of which are the deleted scenes, where Night explains his reasoning behind each cut that he made during editing.Over all, an outstanding movie and a great DVD.	5.0	An Instant Classic	2008-11-15	2	1	1

I fully enjoyed it both times, even if with a different perspective.As soon as it was released to VHS I add it to my collection!With ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999), arguably, director M. Night Shyamalan has achieved his best movie up to the present moment. In the following years he has delivered some good movies as ""Unbreakable"" (2000) and ""The Village"" (2004), but they are one step below the present one.The story is about Malcolm, a child psychologist that starts treating Cole, a kid that lives terrorized.Little by little he is able to win his confidence and learn that the boy sees dead people almost everywhere.This situation is unbearable for Cole and stresses his relation with his mother and spoils his social life.Malcolm is decided to overcome the mental disease. At the same time his marriage starts to crumble.The whole plot is very ingenious and delivers one twist after other until the end ....then you'll be ready to see the whole story again, and again.It is addictive, you'll always find new interesting details each time you see it again.Play acting is one of the high points of the film. Two of them are absolutely outstanding: Haley Joel Osment performing as Cole shows an extraordinary maturity to convey to the audience all the turmoil of the kid's soul. He will revalidate this merits in his performances at ""Pay It Forward"" (2000) and ""Artificial Intelligence: AI"" (2001).The other one is given by Bruce Willis, endearing, compassionate and compromised with an unusual character for his career.Toni Collete as Cole's mother and Olivia Williams as Malcolm's wife are also very good.Even if the film failed to convert its six nominations into an award, undoubtedly it is a product of superior category.Reviewed by Max Yofre."	5.0	Viewing This Film Once Is Not Enough!	2005-07-25	2	1	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	ALOH4QTQQRYW4	M. Beck	"Not being a Willis fan I avoided seeing this movie until it reached the 250 million level, and mostly because it was nominated for Best Picture.  I kept seeing references to a ""Sixth Sense style of plot twist"" in reviews of  other movies so I'm sure I would have enjoyed the ending a lot more if I'd  seen it earlier because after the first scene it's pretty obvious what the  ""twist"" is.  I spent the rest of the movie noticing the technique of the  screenwriter and the director - a little distracting to be sure.I was  not impressed with this movie - it certainly doesn't deserve a best picture  nom, but Oscar marketing being what it is nowadays - but it does have it's  moments.  My favorite scene is near the end where the kid tells his mom  about the dance (?) recital.  Pretty manipulative, but very effective  thanks to Toni Colette.The DVD package of extras is excellent.  I rented  the DVD just for the extras and didn't bother watching the movie  again.Let me ask a question:  when Willis goes to see the kid at his  house, and is sitting in the living room with the mom, doesn't he think  it's strange that she doesn't know that he's even there.  Did she answer  the door when he knocked?  I mean, he's dead, right?  So she wouldn't see...  anyway.  Maybe this is the kind of thing I'm supposed to suspend disbelief  for but..."	3.0	DVD is a great value, but the movie is...eh?	2000-06-03	3	1	2
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1JVBGZI2VN1IB	MCE	I got to the end of 'The 6th sense' still waiting for something frightening, or even mildly thrilling, to happen... Not a bad movie per se, but the way it was hyped I expected much more. The acting, however, is  superb. As the plot unfolds, the movie swaps genres, getting from horror to  thriller to social drama to tear-jerker, making it sometimes confusing and  difficult to understand where the director is trying to take you. The  ending, whether or not it comes as a surprise, is rather disappointing. All  in all, it made me think of some remake of 'Always', 'Ghost' or 'City of  Angels', all based on the theme of the dead trying to communicate with the  living. 'Stir of Echoes' with Kevin Bacon, based on a similar theme, is  less ambitious but, in my opinion, more efficient.All in all, 'the 6th  sense' is a fun movie but still far from coming even close to being one of  last year's best.	3.0	Somewhat disappointing...	2000-04-04	2	0	2

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	The first time you watch this film, you'll be shocked. The second time, you'll learn to look for all the clues. If you watch it more than twice, you'll spot pretend clues, and wonder if they mean anything. And eventually, you will know the film back to front.For first time watchers, this movie is terrific. It's almost terrifying to watch, and horrible to try and work out what exactly is happening to Cole, and also, the lovely Bruce Willis.If you watch carefully, you'll notice the colour red plays a big part in this movie, particularly when something's about to happen, or is happening. Although, after a while, you start noticing things that are red, that have nothing to do with danger (the mum quite often has red nail varnish and wears a red top in the last couple of scenes and there are red candles in the house). But just watching for these clues again had something to the movie that it didn't have the first time watching.Some people say that the film was so predictable, cos they knew from the opening scenes what was going to happen (when Malcolm, Bruce Willis' character, got shot). Well, it wasn't so obvious to me the very first time I watched it. However, films that are too predictable, are rubbish. I would have hated to have known all along what the ending was.Both Bruce &amp; Haley (Joel Osment) are so cute in this movie. Don't know what it is about Brucie in this, he looks kinda rough sometimes, but it just adds to the whole loveliness of him!This is a movie that will stay with you for ages afterwards. Whether it was the constant emails, particularly after the Queen Mother died, with her picture in stills from the movie, or its repeats on TV - you'll be reminded of this great movie constantly.And I just have to hear &quot;I see dead people&quot;, and it sends shivers up my spine with remembering the scene in the movie that it happens!	4.0	Haunting	2004-05-18	0	0	0

I won't tell you why either...but let me just say that this movie has a surprise  twist that you really don't expect and that leaves you on the edge of your  seat.  Haley Joel Osment is wonderful in this movie!  His adult-like  demeanor in an otherwise little kid makes his performance all the more  real.  It's plain to see why he got an Oscar nomination for this role.  Bruce Willis, who steps away from his action hero roles, comes through as  the quiet, but helpful child psychologist who Osment finally trusts with  his &quot;awful&quot; secret.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1CDNTB7377YH2	Michael A. Newman	Bruce Willis as a psychiatrist, who is home with his wife one evening when they are startled by an intruder in their bathroom.  The intruder was one of Willis' patients who had asked Willis for help but apparently Willis never listened.  Willis tries to reason with him but he shoots Willis in the stomach before taking his own life.The next scenes follow Willis as he is assigned to help a troubled you boy who is about 10.  We suspect it is sometime after he was shot but we are not really sure until later in the movie.  The boy (Cole) has been doing strange things at school like drawing pictures of dead people and telling the teacher that the government used to hang people in the schoolhouse.  Things like this set Cole apart from all the other kids who treat him as an outcast.Willis first encounters Cole in a church and lets Cole know that he is there to try to help him.  Cole is distrustful of Willis at first but pretty soon Willis is able to convince Cole that he is there to help him.The picture moves at a slow pace with a few snippets of Cole's weird behavior coming through.  It is only through about halfway through the movie that Cole tells Willis why he acts the way he does.  Willis thinks that Cole's explanation is that of a sick mind but later on he will be convinced otherwise.There are some heartwarming scenes between Cole and his mother (something strange throughout is that Cole's mother and Willis never talk about Cole - this is explained much later) and the weird way that Willis' wife seems to be treating him.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	Oh, come on, fellow customers.  You who claim you had it figured out, did you really?  And even if you did, wasn't it fun getting to the end anyway?  This is one heck of a movie.  It has a wonderfully realized plot,  believable characters who act like they really care about each other.  There's little to fault with this movie.  Bruce Willis again is  under-appreciated.  He got lost in all the hoopla over Haley Joel Osment.  But Bruce turns in a very multi-layered and controlled performance.  Haley  is just out of this world great!  Never have I seen a child actor who has  performed to this level.  Not once did I think Haley was acting.  He  definitely should have won the Oscar for supporting actor.  At his age,  what an accomplishment---to carry so much of this complex, involving film.  Those little shoulders did a fantastic job.  I'm looking forward to seeing  him in &quot;Pay Forward&quot; with Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt.  He's an  actor to reckon with!  Also, Toni Colette as Cole's mother is fabulous.  One of the few screen mothers who really seemed to be a mother.  Her  performance is &quot;the heart&quot; of the movie.  Watching her go through  her many layers of love, guilt, fear, and frustration, and yet maintain  that love for her troubled son is worth the price of the video!  Olivia  Williams as Willis' wife is also extremely effective in a smaller but  significant role.  Even after the movie ends, you want more.  And the  &quot;Rules and Clues&quot; tagged on the VHS edition help explain the  director's ways he made sure everything fit properly.  It begs for a second  viewing, so let me get off now and pop it in the VCR again.  It's a great  movie!  That's the truth!	5.0	Truly a Classic	2000-06-17	4	3	1
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	ANWGS0LTYYDUG	Michael C. Riehle	The thriller billing for this movie may put some people off.  But if you're expecting blood and gore or shock horror, this is the wrong movie for you.  If you're looking for good, emotional drama about human feelings  and what makes - at least some - humans tick, you will enjoy this  movie.The characters aren't always likeable, but they're always  believable.  What gore there is (and there is some - this is *not* a movie  for children) makes sense in context and has a strong impact.  This young  boy is scared and the film allows you to understand and sympathize with his  fear without trying to draw you into it.There is even room for romance  in this movie.  Romance on the level of long-standing, deep emotional  connections.  It is, in fact, a strong sub-theme in the life of the  doctor.Sometimes events in the movie are predictable, but even there  it's only because they are only logical.  It's the only way it could  happen.  And these are more than made up for by the twists and turns that  do occur.If you are a person who thrives on happy endings, you may find  this movie hard to take.  But if you can see the relativeness of happy and  sad in an ending and appreciate the importance of both, you'll most likely  find this one of the best movie experiences you've ever had.	5.0	The ultimate not-a-thriller thriller	2000-05-08	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A5HMT6ZOBUAVM	"""michaeleve"""	...This question is asked of child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) by 10 year old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), somewhere mid relationship. It's very important to Cole because he wants to trust, and to tell his secret. Malcolm's answer &quot;I got an award once, from the mayor&quot; would seem to be a yes, but he's not so sure himself anymore.About a year earlier, Malcolm and his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) were at home celebrating his receiving the award when an ex-patient Vincent, no longer a child and violently disturbed - having broken in, surprises them from where he had been hiding in their bedroom. He is scared, inconsolable and very angry with Malcolm for having failed him. In a fit of anguish he shoots Malcolm and kills himself.Now a year later, Malcolm has concerns. Cole is exhibiting some of the same neuroses and signs of abnormal behavior reminiscent of Vincent. On top of that, he and Anna have grown distant, he can't seem to connect with her and he's definitely not helping Cole. But Cole, having come to trust Malcolm and encouraged by his gentleness and patience, is now ready to tell his secret... &quot;I see dead people. Walking around like regular people. They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead&quot;. Ghosts! Not nightmares, he's not sleeping - Cole sees them all the time.At the mention of Ghosts some of us may be instantly turned off, especially if we do not much care for the use of Ghosts in movies - either for horror, as a gag or as a statement about the life beyond. Especially true if we don't believe in ghosts. The use of Ghosts here though, does not fall into any of these categories, and much more importantly it does not affect the plausibility or watchability of the movie in the least bit. We are drawn elsewhere. The action is with Cole and Malcolm and what is happening in their minds, psyches and relationships. Is Cole's mind slipping away into a state similar to Vincent's? Is Anna's love for Malcolm already gone? and back to where we began - Is the good doctor no longer any good, has he lost the ability to reach out and help? We know he has a gift - the mayor gave him an award. Malcolm is frustrated, puzzled, confused even. Why are things the way they are?The answers come in a rush of awareness. Sudden, stunning clarity for Malcolm, and for us. An understanding of who was helping who. A conclusion that simply staggered me and made me want to watch the movie again to see what slipped by me before.	5.0	Are you a good Doctor?...	2001-02-21	1	1	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2S6KKPGH2NQU	Michael Gilbert	If you haven't seen the film yet, Bruce Willis DOES NOT compromise it.  I thought he would, but he does a wonderful job, as do all actors involved.  Yes there is a neat little (understatement) secret that reveals itself in  the end, but if you're perceptive, you might catch on early in the film.  As for the packaging of the DVD version, it has all the standard extras  like cast interviews/bios, deleted scenes, etc.  That's always nice and we  come to expect that.  But what knocks off that 5th star for me is the fact  that YOU HAVE TO WATCH MANDATORY PREVIEWS WHEN YOU INITIALLY PLAY THE DISC!  I have a simple, low-end DVD player and can't get around the previews  unless I use &quot;Program Play&quot; and go directly into the movie or  fast forward through the previews.  It won't let you push the  &quot;Menu&quot; button or even stop the playback while these previews are  going!  If you have a nicer player, you may be able to &quot;Chapter  Skip&quot; over them, but the point is:  you shouldn't have to skip over  the previews and if I have to fast forward over them, I might as well be  watching the movie on my VCR!  I hope film distributors ARE NOT going to  continue to pursue this type of marketing.  If I want to watch previews  (which I usually do, just not EVERY TIME I WATCH THE FILM) I'll select them  from the menu.	4.0	Excellent movie, a little poor on the packaging	2000-03-31	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3QZCA4LTTVGAD	Michael J. Mazza	&quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, is one of those films that has enjoyed both great critical acclaim and tremendous popular success. And it deserves them both: this is, simply, a great film. Shyamalan tells the story of Cole Sear (played by Haley Joel Osment), a little boy with a terrifying supernatural ability. He lives with his mother, a single parent (Toni Colette). Child psychiatrist Malcom Crowe (Bruce Willis) attempts to help the boy deal with the disturbing ramifications of his &quot;gift.&quot;&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is a horror film that doesn't rely on monsters and gore: the horror here is largely psychological in nature. But the film ultimately transcends the horror genre; it is also a serious family drama that is told with intelligence and compassion. It is as much about love and communication as it is about fear.All the performances in the film are first rate. If you only know Bruce Willis as the star of hyperactive action flicks, be prepared for a revelation. He delivers a performance that is restrained, yet rich with emotional texture. Toni Colette is heartbreaking as the struggling mother.And then there's Haley Joel Osment. He is absolutely extraordinary in a performance that ultimately holds the whole film together. Although he was nominated for a supporting Oscar, I consider this a lead role in terms of screen time and centrality to the film. His chemistry with both Colette and Willis is absolutely electrifying; this kid is one of the best actors of any age group. Osment will frighten you, break your heart, and uplift your spirit in this role; his performance alone makes this film worth watching.The ingenious script has its own inner logic; Shyamalan creates an intimate mythos which is consistent and compelling. He uses a brilliant combination of low-tech effects and production details to enhance his story. And James Newton Howard's excellent score complements the film as a whole.&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is one of those great films that rewards repeated viewings. Actually, I believe that a second viewing is absolutely essential. All in all, a deeply moving piece of cinematic art.	5.0	Must be seen at least twice	2002-01-05	4	2	2

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	ATNX84AGYIN39	"Michael Roffman ""pinball wizard"""	The film which opened last August of 1999 blew everyone away. I, myself, never in a million years thought the film would be so credited as I watched it the opening night. Well the film is now the number one thriller and here  I'am. The DVD blew me away with it's captivating images and horrifying  sounds. The DVD menu impacted me more than the film with all the images. It  helps the watcher develop a spooky and freakish mood which helps you enjoy  the film in a fun way. The features also helped me learn more about the  film, why wouldn't it? I enjoyed watching M. Night's first horror film  which I laughed vigorously. Among the features are deleted scenes which I  feel were neglected great. Osmont's performace alone in a scene entitled,  Toy Soldiers was just tear shedding and really made you believe in the  character. Look at me, the DVD has brought me to babble on. That's good I  guess. The film is wonderful and probably the best of '99. Performances by  Willis went un-noticed by the Academy, but people who've seen Willis in  films such as Die Hard will be surprised to find him just as great as  Osmont. I highly advise you to purchase this DVD only because you can watch  it over and over again and always find something new. It's fun,  entertaining, and you can learn a lot from the features. Now let's hope  Shyamalan can pull of the Indiana Jones IV script!	5.0	The Digital Sense	2000-06-28	1	1	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	What is with human beings and their attraction to the super-natural? Despite the quality of horror features going down the toilet for the past few decades, millions of people across the world flock to these films on opening weekends, whether they are on dates or a night out with their friends, to be scared and grossed out. Heck ? the investigation of the supernatural has become a billion dollar business for ?psychics? like John Edwards who have legions of fans buying their books, attending their shows, and buying into their ridiculous mumbo-jumbo ? but why do we do it? Is it natural curiosity into the concept of death? Is it the fear of something beyond our comprehension? Is it our natural insecurity and the paranoia that we not alone? There are no direct answers to those questions, and there may never be, but as long as Hollywood keeps making the focus of their films, we will come.The story centers on a boy who believes he can see ghosts and a psychiatrist who must find a way to help this child cope with his special ability that may unravel a mysterious truth not only for the boy but for himself as well. Dr. Malcolm Crowe is one of the best child psychiatrists in the city of Philadelphia. In fact, he was awarded a special honor by the mayor of Philadelphia himself ? the very same night a former patient of his named Vincent Grey breaks into his home. At first Malcolm struggles to remember him but as Vincent rambles on about details of the counseling, he begins to recall a young boy who shy, quiet, well behaved, and what he believed at the time was an inability to coup with the divorce of his parents. But Vincent believes that he has been cursed and Dr. Crowe has failed in promise to help the boy. Clearly at the end of his rope, Vincent Grey decides to end his life by shooting himself in the head but not before he gets one shot out on Dr. Crowe. Time passes and Malcolm Crowe returns to his job, though he has yet to fully recover mentally from the strange encounter. He is visiting a young boy by the name of Cole Sear ? an unusual little boy who hides out in a church and speaks Latin while playing with tiny soldier figures in between the benches. Cole?s mother who is separated from her husband is at her wits end. Not only does she have to balance two jobs to keep the small household supported but Cole?s alarming behavior has taken a huge toll on her ability to go about a normal routine with a calm mind. And don?t believe that Malcolm?s life is any less hectic ? not only is he desperately trying to redeem himself for the failure over Vincent Grey with young Cole but his marriage is failing and he is doing everything possible to help reconcile with his wife. But when young Cole reveals his secret that his has the ability to see ghosts, who want him to do things for them, Malcolm is reminded of Vincent Grey and that he will do anything he can to prevent Cole from meeting the same end. The story of The Sixth Sense stands alone as one of the best super-natural thrillers in years, if not of all time. Shymalan, who before this film was not known for this type of genre, truly makes a name for himself with this thought-provoking and riveting script. The ending is not quite as shocking to those who pay attention to the little bits and pieces Shyamalan places throughout the film to clue audiences into what is to come, but none the less it was disappointing either and that?s all that matters.The cast for the film, though large in a sense when considering the numerous amount of characters with screen-time less then two minutes, is small in scale, especially when one considers that the film mainly centers on the actions of Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis. Haley Joel Osment, who is best known for his small appearance in the Academy Award-winning Forrest Gump, showcases his uncanny ability for acting by successfully pulling off one of the most challenging performances a director can give a child of his age, let alone any actor with as less experience as he has on screen. By taking on the role of Cole Sear, Osment not only has to play the victim in the sense that he wants Dr. Crowe to make the ghosts go away, but he switches roles continually throughout the film from the victim to that of an encouraging hero. Along with that, the way he and Bruce Willis act off of each other is so natural that the audience becomes attached to these characters and becomes deeply involved into what happens around them. Bruce Willis, more known for his adrenaline powered roles in such action-dramas as the Die Hard series then films of this nature, proves to audiences once again, as he did in Quentin Tarantino?s Pulp Fiction, that can slip into the more emotionally charged roles with losing any of the masculine mystic that you find so blatantly his action films. And, borrowing a page from Alfred Hitchcock?s directing book, M. Night Shyamalan makes an appearance in the film as Dr. Hill, the doctor who examines Cole after he is trapped in a closet. It?s not a whole lot of screen-time but it?s a wonderful surprise for those who know what they are looking for.Overall, The Sixth Sense, despite lacking the exhilarating punch that had been promised as the film?s ending (if you paid attention to clues, it was kind of obvious), wipes the floor of its predecessors and redefines the genre that had been typically by mindless slasher flicks for far too long. This is not to say that the film?s ending is not a surprise ? to some it may be but for those who pay attention reasonably close to the clues placed throughout the film, it may come as a bit of a let down but not one that will ruin the entire film for you. Don?t go into this film with all the built-up hype the media and fellow movie-goers have place in your head. If you go into this film with a clear mind, not expecting anything more then an entertaining and intelligent thriller, then you will have a better appreciation for M. Night Shyamalan?s work then some people may have. Everything comes together so brilliantly in this film that is hard to find a film in the past few years that matches the exact effect The Sixth Sense is able to pull off ? the chilling musical score, brilliant performances, complex dialogue, intricate script, and clever direction, all of which work together and never seem to outbalance one another. If there anything to complain about this is that does tend to drag a little near the end but this is minor complaint that doesn?t match up exceedingly with the good that is presented in this film. The Sixth Sense is not strictly warranted to those who only believe in the concept of ghosts, but for those who enjoy the idea of being scared out of their seats even by a concept they themselves don?t believe in.	4.0	The Moose Hole - It's Good to See Dead People	2004-07-22	1	1	0

The sad truth is that this film is a complete rehash of the earlier film &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot;, from which is steals its structure and its 'knockout ending'.Granted, Tak Fujimoto has done a superb job with the cinematography, and the look and feel of the film are superb.  There are no over-the-top special effects, and everything that creeps you out is done in a very subtle and subversive manner.My biggest problem with this movie is that I just can't give it credit for being a copy-cat film.  It's one thing to re-engineer another film, but to do it and not give credit where credit's due is bang out of order.  I bet Adrian Lynne (the director of Jacob's ladder) is fuming.  Besides, could you really walk around for a whole year and not notice you're not getting served at restaurants and that no one is talking to you?  Also, if cold air only comes out of people's mouths when the dead people are angry, then why does it come out of Willis' wife at the end?? Well apparently the director of this movie didn't pay too much attention to these plot holes, because he had built his film on the structure and ending of another, and that is all he was probably concerned about.If this film had been original, I could have given it maybe 3 stars.If you liked the movie, you'll probably like the extras, but lookout for the bit on how the story line was conceived.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1L2MWNSPDVX9X	Mindy Simmons	After a 3 month slump of renting what we consider &quot;dud&quot; movies (but actually did fairly well at the box office), my husband and I marveled at the way in which The Sixth Sense pulled us out of movie dispair...it has  it all- suspense, drama, action, romance, and the entire spectrum of human  emotions.  It is not afraid to make us think, and is one of the few movies  that makes a second viewing a near necessity.  The acting is  spectacular...from little Hayley to Bruce Willis, to Donnie Wahlberg (who  is hardly recognizable), and to the female roles...all wonderful  performances.  As for the DVD, the interviews with the director are a  wonderful addition.  Night's obvious (and well-justified) enthusiasm for  his movie are reflected in the colorful interviews and explanations of his  favorite scenes, those that were in the movie, and those he had to cut out.  The deleted scene section was intriguing, as well as the way in which they  describe the difficulties of designing the movie for both the &quot;first  timers&quot; and &quot;returning viewers&quot;.  It is one of the first  DVD's we've rented that took full advantage of the benefits of releasing a  movie on DVD.  Kudos to all involved in the film...it brightened my  otherwise mundane weekend!	5.0	Finally! A movie worth watching...	2000-04-16	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AKJ9MEE93DG5O	mitchell5954	Sixth Sense is a good film, but I found it very overrated. Everyone and their mother praises this film as being not only one of M. Night Shyamalan's best films but one of the best films period. So when I finally saw the film I was quite underwhelmed. I found it to be a decent suspense/horror film. The acting was fine. Bruce Willis does a good job in the film. However, I do not see it as the masterpiece that everyone thinks it is.Bruce Willis plays a child psychologist named Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Crowe meets a Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment. Cole claims to be able to see dead people wherever he goes.People say that this is one of the scariest movies they've ever seen. I saw the film and was not scared in the least. If I were five I'd probably be scared. However, I've far scarier films. The twist at the end you could see coming judging from the beginning of the film.Bruce Willis and Haley do a fine job acting wise. I did like these two characters. I thought they were both likable and had energy, which is more than I can say for the character in Shyamalan's latest works. The story was competent as well.Overall I liked the Sixth Sense, but I do not think it is as good a people make it out to be. If this film did not have as much hype around it, then I might have liked it more. I went in expecting a flawless masterpiece, and I felt a little underwhelmed.	3.0	Good, but Slightly Overrated!	2013-05-08	4	0	4
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3DSC3FFBC0LKC	Mitchell R. Alegre	This is not the usual horror movie. There is a minimum of gore. Yet the tension keeps you in its grip throughout the film. The message of this film is one of healing. By facing what we fear healing can come. This is a movie  that moves the viewer through a wide range of emotions from fear to love.

Utterly covincing, and even for a jaded movie-goer like me (I pride myself on smelling a  &quot;twist&quot; in a story from a mile away), the ending of this movie  had my jaw flapping in the wind. Thoroughly entertaining, masterful  story-telling by Shyamalan. I recommend all to watch this film, even if  you're deathly afraid of thrillers and ghost-stories like I am.

Both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment are incredible and believable.  I was scared to the point of peeking through my fingers at times, mezmerized and totally surprised at the end!  This is a classic; I'm buying it for my own library.  I will be watching it over and over again and will be on the watch, now that I know the Rules and Clues of the film.  Fabulous film making, directing, acting, plot, cinematography, everything.  I can't stop thinking about the film.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1YSUQ5LHAT9IF	Moaz	This movie is loosely based on a low-budget 1962 cult classic called &quot;Carnival of Souls.&quot; The two movies are somewhat different, but their endings reveal the same surprize. For me, The Sixth Sense was less  like a horror movie, and more like a really good episode of Twilight Zone.  Lots of atmosphere, and a great surprize ending. Even if you're not a  horror movie fan, and don't much care about stories about the supernatural  (like myself) you'll still probably get a kick out of this movie. Why 4  stars and not 5? Too much Hollywood style attempted manipulation of the  viewers emotions. But then again some people like that. I mean, look how  popular movies like &quot;Independence Day&quot; became. Now that was a bad  movie.	4.0	The Sixth Sense	2000-02-11	4	2	2

The kid's experience seems so real that you think you would begin to see dead people as you walk out of the theatre. A  subdued performance from Bruce Willis. After Mercury Rising, Bruce seems to  have taken a liking to working with paranormal-above normal kids. The film  drags a bit once in a while when you feel that a camera is hanging on a  spot too long. That is the reason for a four star rating. But surely an  extreemly enjoyable movie, a must buy.	4.0	Incredible movie	2000-04-28	0	0	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R	Movie Fan	"And... one of the best movies of all time. The shmucks who complained about this film on amazon, probably dont even understand it. Watch the making of, and they explain everything, and how certain things were hints to the parts often overlooked or confused people, and never just watch this film once. The second time you'll notice more. This is a very intelligent film, and it ""gets"" those more who have had experiences with paranormal, death, loss, and grief, and even fear. I wouldnt say it's just a horror, but it's creepy enough to be called that, but it's also a drama, because at times haley joel osment's acting is so terrific that it's touching, espeically when he cries. I've never seen a more genuine actor at his age. He has alot of talent. And the parts where he was acting ""terrified"" was more realistic than i've ever seen in any movie. I think Bruce Willis was the perfect man to play malcom, because for some reason certain people, actors and actresses mesh well in movies, and you can sense the chemistry among the actors. Haley And Bruce were great together in this film. This movie is perfect in my opinion. No flaws as far as i am concerned. I love this movie and am glad that thousands and thousands of people appreciated this movie for what it is, and for those of you who could never appreciate this film, that's too bad. There are probably many life lessons you havent learned yet. Watch this movie in 5 years and if you still hate it, i almost feel bad for you. I also heard that some ghostly figures, (shadows) were seen during the making of this film that they never added in. I dont know if it's true, but i've heard of that happening before. I. E. Poltergeist, exoricist. Certain movies, bring a certain kind of energy, and to people who are involved in the making of these kind of movies. I think that, to make a good movie, you have to kind of live it, live the role, breathe, eat and sleep, the role you are given. You almost become that person you play in the movie, and by doing that you open your mind to things  you wouldnt normally. So it makes sense that some spirit activity occured, and some paranormal activity was reported to have happened on the set. There are things out there, we dont understand, but they do exist."	5.0	Creepy, sad, thought provoking, touching, and entertaining....	2005-11-05	3	2	1

Cole keeps this fact very secretive and well-hidden, but when Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) comes along, Cole believes that he can help him. Can Crowe help him? Or is Cole stuck with this horrible trauma?The Sixth Sense is a pure, fresh breath of air for horror movies. It is directed and written brilliantly by M. Night Shamalyn. Bruce Willis plays the main character, Dr. Malcolm Crowe, and his performance was rudely underrated. But, it is Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette who manage to shine the most. Osment is brilliant as the confused kiddo Cole, he deserved an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Toni Collette shone like a superstar, her performance as the terrified mother was a very effective turn for her career. Go and see this now.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2ZVERVFM25MJT	"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283"""	This creepy little horror movie is actually a good deal better than the genre suggests.  Next to all those vacuous teen horror films it is a real gem.  The story follows child psychologist Willis as he tries to unearth the traumas of a small boy called Cole (Osmont) who claims to see dead people whilst he himself has troubles at home with wife Olivia Williams.What's crucial is that Shyamalan hasn't just created a horror shocker but has intensely studied human loss.  Indeed, it is this rather than the ghosts themselves that is the real horror.  Plus, it's a rare horror movie that doesn't only scare its audience but also move them, both of which `The Sixth Sense' manages to do.  The scares are also a lot more to do with tricky camerawork that will make you jump out of your seat than gut-wrenching horror.  This is itself makes it rise above all the other soulless movies that preceded it.Much has been made of Osmont's performance as the haunted child Cole.  Basically, all of the hype is correct, he perfectly judges the character and his performance is of the kind that etches itself on its audience's psyche.  Yet this certainly doesn't mean that the other talent on show here should go unnoticed.  Willis turns in his best ever performance in an understated, quietly touching role and Toni Collette makes you forget all about her brassy role in `Muriel's Wedding'.Perhaps what makes the movie so good though is the fact that it is a distinctly adult horror that genuinely frightens and moves its audience.	5.0	Outstanding Horror-Drama	2002-03-16	2	1	1

Bruce Willis' perfomance is wonderful - exhibiting the depth that has always seemed just  beyond him.  I coughed up $8 three times for this one (each time expecting  to be less interested than before) and found myself even more into it than  the last.  Haley Joel Osment is great as the boy with a terrifying power (I  see GOLD in his future).  If I had to have a gripe, I'd say the supporting  cast is a little weak, but that is a minor point.I must say, I don't  think I have heard ANYONE talking about the ending --  I must conclude that  there are some sort of subliminal messages keeping people from revealing  it, because I don't think I've EVER seen a movie that hasn't had the best  part(s) ruined by the general public.Treat yourself and buy this DVD -  it will be well worth it!	5.0	Intense!	2000-01-26	1	1	0

Nominated for several Academy Awards this year including the coveted Best Picture as well as Best Director, Best Original Screenplay,  Best Original Score, Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress.  All the performances are impressive in the movie, especially that of  11-year old Haley Joel Osment who is the youngest Oscar-nominee this year.  I have to admit, this kid has got talent.  More talent than a lot of other  actors 4 times his age.  Bruce Willis may have been the so-called star of  this movie but the kid definitely stole the show.  I was very pleased to  see that Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding) was nominated in this year's  Oscar race.  She was completed ignored at the Golden Globe and Screen  Actors Guild Awards.  Her final scene in the movie is one of my favourites.  Osment talks to his mother, played by Collette about her deceased  Grandmother.  He assures that she continues to watch over her and that she  has made her very proud as her grand-daughter.  The breakdown scene in the  car was so beautifully acted.  As for the movie's Oscar chances come this  March, l definitely know that it won't win Best Picture, but it does have a  good chance at snagging Best Original Screenplay and l don't care what  anyone says, l'm rooting for the kid to win on Oscar night.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	ALNK3ZLU578SB	Nate	&quot;I see dead people.&quot; &quot;You mean dead people like in coffins and graves?&quot; &quot;No, walking around like regular people.&quot; This is a scene from The Sixth Sense.  It is when Cole tells his secret, that he  can see dead people that walk around like normal people. I would give this  movie a 4 out of 5 stars.  It was a good movie with a surprising twist  ending.  It is rated PG-13 and I wouldn't recommend it for younger viewers  because of the images of the dead people.  It is a good movie for older  viewers. The director of the film was M. Night Shyamalan.  He has directed  the movie Wide Awake, which is a similar film.  Bruce Willis is Malcolm  Crowe in the movie.  He is a child psychologist that was one of the  greatest psychologists in his field.  Cole Sear, or Haley Joel Osment, is  the young child that Malcolm is trying to help.  Malcolm's wife Anna, or  Olivia Williams, also plays an important part in the movie. In the movie  Malcolm wins an award for being one of the best child psysiologists.  Later  at his house, one of the students that he failed to help breaks in and  shoots Malcolm and himself.  The movie goes to the next fall where Malcolm  has found a boy with problems.  Cole can see dead people.  He must help the  boy out because the boy has the same symptoms as the person he failed to  help.  He grows very apart from his wife and they never talk.  This all  leads into a surprise ending. I enjoyed the way the movie all came together  in the ending scene.  I also liked how the movie was acted and its  storyline.  It is a good movie that keeps you thinking. I think that you  should see this movie.  It is a thriller that makes you leave the theater  how great of a movie it was.  It was scary at times, especially when the  dead people were walking around.  Some people say that it was a dull movie,  but when you are forced to look at Cole's problem it isn't very dull.	5.0	The sixth Sense	2000-05-16	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AAD3V7FQUXO2Z	Nathan Alderman	Writer/director M. Night Shymalan's &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is that rarest of breeds: an intelligent, well-made film that conquered the box office. Equal parts mystery, drama and bone-chilling horror,  &quot;Sense&quot; deals with a weary, wounded child psychologist (Bruce  Willis) whose latest patient (the remarkable Haley Joel Osment) has a  mysterious and terrible gift: he sees ghosts.Shymalan, ably assisted by  Tak Fujimoto's brilliantly icy cinematography, wrings suspense and terror  out of empty doorways, split-second glimpses of figures in the background,  and unknown things lurking in the dark. But this is hardly a cheap slasher  film: perhaps the most wonderful aspect of this film is its message, that  fear can be conquered through understanding and compassion.Cleverly  plotted, bolstered by fine performances from Olivia Williams as Willis's  melancholy wife and Toni Colette as Osment's worried mom, and graced with a  twist ending worthy of Hitchcock, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is a  magnificently creepy film that will have you jumping at shadows long after  it's over.	5.0	Perhaps the best film of 1999.	2000-01-15	131	115	16
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AEB45TKHZI37F	Nathan	Now maybe it's because I had the ending spoiled for me before I saw it,  but the first time I saw this movie it didn't seem so great.  I enjoyed it,  sure, but I sure didn't think it deserved a best picture nomination.  Because the ending was spoiled, all the hints thereto seemed obvious and  overlong.The second time I watched it it seemed interminably long and  boring.  There was so much whispering, so many scenes where characters just  stand around and talk.  The kid did an absolutely incredible acting job,  but something about Willis (maybe his hair) wasn't really doing anything  for me.There were some neat scenes where a description of an event is  juxtaposed with it happening, and a few neat ideas about the dead, but  there are also a few plotholes.For a similarly themed movie that is much  better than this one, try A Stir of Echoes.	3.0	Not so great	2000-07-05	1	0	1
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	ATMQ84R4NXM0Y	Nathaniel Lanza	I loved the movie in the theaters, so I was pretty happy to get it on DVD. Unfortunately, when I started playing the disc, it jumped straight to previews. Lots of previews. Even worse, some genius thought it would be a  good idea to disable the stop, pause, and menu buttons. This means that you  can't jump straight to the menu -- you have to keep hitting fast forward  until all the previews are done. I hate this; I'd really rather not have to  see a &quot;Mission To Mars&quot; preview every single time I put in my  &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; disc. I could sort of understand this if it was a  rental edition, but it's not. I really have no idea why anyone thought that  doing this was a good idea.It's a shame, because the disc is otherwise  pretty nice. There are a bunch of extra features -- trailers, deleted  scenes, an extended ending, a little documentary, and so forth.  Unfortunately, the preview problem is annoying enough that I'm thinking of  returning the disc.	4.0	Great movie, bad DVD presentation.	2000-03-30	17	13	4
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1ID3W5CT59DAT	Nathan S. Joyce	The thing to realise with &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is that it is just a movie.At times, you all too often find yourself lost, deep within the layered suspense and refreshingly clever plot.&quot;I see dead  people.&quot; Indeed, the boy Cole sees these walking wounded, and without  a fair degree of experience, knows only fear and disbelieving reluctance  when such a thing crosses his path.This is the story of a Philadelphia  child psychologist; an award winning one at that. An encounter at the  movie's beginning sees him injured by a previous patient- one who was  unable to be helped.From there, we are drawn in as the doctor attempts  to help Cole. We are as intriuged as he is by the boy's unnatural talent.Ultimately, the greatest shock comes after Cole has overcome his fear of  the walking dead; a shock that affects not only the doctor, but we, the  transfixed audience, as well.	4.0	Genuine thrills and storytelling...	2000-03-11	3	1	2

His next child is Cole, a young boy who can see dead people. At first Malcolm doesn't believe the boy but he starts to help him out and slowly beging to believe the boy. Malcolm is also having problems with his wife, she doesn't seem to love him that much anymore.  Ok, what is the deal with this movie, it's not bad but it's not great. It's no where near as good as it's made out to be nor is it scary. The ending is really predictable, I can't believe no one saw it coming. The movie has some good points, a few good sub plots involving a dead girl tring to call Cole for help. This movie would of been alot better if the plot wasn't known, but it was, Malcolm spend the first half of the movie trying to figure out what is wrong with the kid, it would of been better if we didn't know beforehand either.	2.0	Way over hyped	2001-02-02	5	1	4

Night Shyamalan, a veritable roller coaster of suspense.  Nothing is as it seems, and for once an ending literally comes out of nowhere, but when taken in the context of the film is totally understandable.  Bruce Willis is superb (I think it was the little smirk that can't totally be erased that may have cost him a well-deserved Oscar nomination), Toni Collette is, as usual, great.  But it's Haley Joel Osment who will astonish you.  He may have only been ten years old when this was shot, but this kid is a brilliant actor.  He makes you feel his character's terror without screeching or wailing like his peers tend to do.  I am one of the many who believe he was robbed of an Oscar this year--his performance is nothing short of phenomenal.  This is filmmaking of the highest caliber, and deserves to ascend to the pantheon of classics.  A truly great movie!	5.0	The most imaginative movie I've seen in years	2000-09-28	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A146QCGOQPZLTG	Nicole	Bruce Willis stars as Malcom Crowe a very well known and accomplished child psychologist who has everything: a beautiful wife and a amazing career, but a visit from a disturbed patient of Malcom when he was a child makes Malcom realize that although he was able to help so many people there were a few like this patient that he could not reach. Then with one pull of the trigger Malcom's patient kills him and then kills himself. Then Malcom returns to earth and there he meets a special boy named Cole Sears played so intelligently by Haley Joel Osmont who has a special power, he can see dead people. Malcom is determined to help this boy and that maybe in befriending this boy he can help him before it is too late. This movie does not have all that gore like most scary movies, it is a very chilling and intelligent movie, it really makes you think, and every time you watch it there is always something I guarantee that you might have missed like a piece of clothing, an object, and so on. This movie incorporates suspense into drama, and even some comedy. There are also some great supporting performances by Olivia Williams as Malcom's wife, Toni Collette as Cole's mom and there is even a small cameo by director M. Night Shamalayan as a doctor in a clinic.

It says right on the front cover that it is a &quot;collector's edition&quot; DVD -- however, when playing the DVD the first thing one sees is a preview for Mission to Mars, followed  by previews for 4 other movies. A film this good should not be tainted by  movie previews. Those belong in the VHS version.However, I must still  give 5 stars to the movie because of the interesting extras on the DVD. The  deleted scenes are great, and the director says a few words about each  extra feature on the DVD (including the deleted scenes) which is a nice  feature.No director's commentary, which I thought would have been a nice  extra, but he talks about a lot of the interesting aspects of the film in  the other extras (ie, the use of the color red).Still a good buy, but  very sad that the producers of the DVD decided to put those previews in.

It is certainly NOT a bad  film, in fact a reasonably good one.  Shyamalan has hit on a nerve and  scored a bulls eye.  His brand of sentimentality is clearly what audiences  are yearning for.  Check out the AWFUL tripey ending that the director  fought to keep and thankfully had to drop.  The film is littered with  &quot;touching&quot; moments and is designed to tug at the heart strings  rather than stimulate any fear impulses.  It works, but as a maudlin,  almost tearjerking story of mushiness.  NOT as a riveting thriller or  horror film  Strictly for those people who do not watch REAL horror films.  The DVD looks brilliant and is loaded with features.  The previews that  people are moaning about CAN be fast forwarded quite easily on all three  DVD players that we use.  However the SONY DVP 7700 had the most horrendous  layer change i think i have ever encountered.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A30LMTLC9XVWKJ	Only-A-Child	"""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) is generally regarded as a ghost story and that is what it seems to be during the first viewing. There is also an obvious subtext about the nature of our fears as well as themes concerning courage and communication; elements often incorporated into the genre. Most viewers will be conscious of this stuff during the first viewing but will mostly be focused on sorting out the story and processing the intriguing conclusion.But with subsequent viewing(s) the fear factor diminishes and you become aware that this is not a ghost story so much as it is a film about grief; particularly the grief than comes from regret. With this realization comes the awareness that the real power of the film comes from a viewer's subconscious connection with this underlying theme. The object of the film is far more than just giving the audience a scare although it does a first-class job of doing just that. It can also alter your perception of the process of both living and dying.The spirits that seek out young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) do so because there is something they regret doing or not doing during their lives; something that will ease the grief of their passing (for both them and their loved ones). You have Krya's little sister asking Cole if Krya will come back and Cole answering ""not anymore"", after he has helped Krya.And then you have the grieving Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his grieving wife Anna (Olivia Williams): ""Once upon a time there was this person named Malcolm. He worked with children. He loved it. He loved it more than anything else. And then one night, he found out that he made a mistake with one of them. He couldn't help that one. And he can't stop thinking about it, he can't forget. Ever since then, things have been different. He's not the same person that he used to be. And his wife doesn't like the person that he's become. They barely speak anymore, they're like strangers. And then one day Malcolm meets this wonderful little boy, a really cool little boy. Reminds him a lot of the other one. And Malcolm decides to try and help this new boy. 'Cause he feels that if he can help this new boy, it would be like helping that other one too.""The climatic scene in the car between Cole and his mother (Toni Collette) ranks up with cinema's all-time best.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."	5.0	A Classic	2008-04-28	6	4	2

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	"This movie depends on two things. How much you figure out before it ends and how much you have invested yourself in this movie. The two go hand in hand. The truth is that many people figured out the ending within the first few minutes on the bases that they simply ""heard"" it had a great twist. It is actually not that hard to figure out even if you just hear the plot alone and couple that with the fact it has a twist. If you view this film without having heard anything beforehand you are in a much better position to enjoy it, but there is a margin out there who will get it and will only enjoy it because other people did not get it and there is some fun to be had in knowing that other people where played with. Do not believe for a moment that people who say they got it are lying about that. I know plenty of people who got it and the film thus did not have the desired impact that it retains throughout the whole slow affair for that final manipulation of the audience.The truth be told that the whole weight of this somewhat low-budget film is based on the twist. The actual production values are somewhat minimal. You can see that the producers of this flick had trimmed as much as they could on the budget knowing that the impact of the final reel would more than makeup for putting this flick out on the cost that it was made on. There was no risk involved in doing that but obviously it was a financial strategy that worked out for everybody involved. You can see that everyone was happy with the gamble and it paid off. Could you imagine if this film had a bunk ending or a twist that was not very good? The whole film then looks like Bruce Willis just hooked up with a film student for the hell of it.The actual acting on display here is not cutting edge but Haley Joel Osment does walk circles around everyone including Willis. Osment is a very important casting decision here. Without him it would loose some impact. The film's pace is dreadfully slow and it does stall at times. However if you are looking for a payoff then you will get a whooper of a payoff here, unless you fall into the marginal category who have got it and then must sit out the rest of this slow journey until your suspicions are finally unmasked.This is a great twist of a movie, but not such a great movie. Again the premise, plot and structure is based on that ending, a small gamble because of the strength of the twist, but still it leaves the vast majority of this movie somewhere around mediocre with limitations that do show themselves now and again. Sometimes the acting is actually not very good and is a little on the experimental ""new"" side which does not suite having an A-list actor at the helm.So the verdict here is five stars if you are oblivious to everything until the end but only three stars if you get it and must watch through the whole slow affair."	3.0	The Weight of Cold Air	2004-01-09	8	3	5

The director of the 6th sense obviously knows how to move and motivate the full potential of an actor. Halley Joel  Osmont concieved an excellent performance and does deserve best supporting actor.  The story in  genius,  is well scripted, and well done.

Unfortunately his adeptness in handling the material cannot save a film which as a whole is unsatisfying and incoherent. The central premise intrigues, but the twist ending is inadequately set up, contextually makes no sense (so bruce Willis never changed clothes, or opened a door, or spoke to anyone other than this child and never figured out anything was wrong? Wonderful psychologist) and is utterly plagiarised from Herk Harvey's 1962 film 'Carnival of Souls'; a laconic Willis seems content for the most part to sit back and look as bored as I was by about 45 minutes in. Trite Hollywood fodder unfortunatly described by some as a Masterwork; there are numerous directors with greater talent who could do with this kind of recognition.	2.0	Overrated.

It is the story and the way the story is told--both content and context, that display Manoj Night Shyamalans' amazing talent.I cannot view this movie as an entertainment piece. I see it as a query creator. Mr. Night has a talent for generating internal queries from the viewers of his films. When we see a film like this, we cannot help but ask important life questions regarding deeply held unsolved mysteries that effect every one of us. I am referring to our internal selves our spiritual selves.What I like about this movie is that when I watch it I am compelled to experience more of that part of life that I feel. Less of my experience from what I see, hear, smell, taste, or feel externally. I am drawn internally. I am queried spiritually from the unknown. Did you feel like the spirit world was showing you something through this film? I certainly did. The film spoke to me and I can explain it only one way. From the mysterious; not so much ""what or who am I?"" But more so ""why am I here?"" What am I here to learn? From this film, from life. What are you showing me? I ask this from the beyond. From the unknown. Whenever I watch this film, I have to ask.And that is the gift from Manoj Night Shyamalan to his audience."	5.0	My Parallax View	2001-03-09	2	1	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AJUCZE4FYD4VH	"P. Elkin ""phil4000"""	I am always skeptical of overly hyped films and directors. Prior to seeing &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, I would have described both the movie and Shyamalan as being over-hyped.Now that I've seen it, I have to admit that the bang-to-hype ratio is surprisingly high. This is an outstanding movie!What must it be like to be a small boy who &quot;sees dead people&quot;? As a former kid-with-an-overly-active-imagination who had a staircase to the attic in my bedroom closet, I never saw dead people, but I sure had my share of sleepless nights imaging to closet door opening on its own. I thought Haley Joel Osment's performance was extraordinary.I already knew the &quot;big twist&quot; before I saw &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, but I found that it didn't matter. I was able to enjoy the story and the performances on their own merits.With very little graphic gore and few jump-out-and-get-you moments, Shyamalan is able to keep the suspense level very high. Unlike most of the horror/suspense movies made today, which rely on a lot of technology, stunts, and effects, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is a throwback. It could easily have been made in the 40s or 50s, given the level of technology required to pull it off. This is a movie-maker's movie, not a technologist's. I found it refreshing and all the more enjoyable for that.Shyamalan has a ways to go before he earns the title of &quot;The Next Spielberg&quot;, but he's well on his way to the top of the field.For a change, I can say without reservation: Believe the hype!!	5.0	Lives up to the hype	2004-01-02	3	1	2
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3E9C95QHGYKWH	Persuivant	This kind of subject is fascinating for anyone - for each individual on this Earth there isn't a more important question than 'what happens when you die' - whatever the answer is, its eternal.  If you truly aren't  interested in this question, you're either very young, or have missed the  point of life altogether! :-)If you're hoping for a blood-and-guts  horror film, or have come to see it because you've been pulled in by some  hype-machine, you'll probably be disappointed - its not a horror film, its  a thoughtful, suspenseful story - and there are few films ever made that  can live up to their marketing hype, so don't listen to it!  You'll nearly  always go away feeling ripped-off.&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; features a  boy, Cole Sear, who is being terrified by visions of the dead, and a child  psychologist, Malcolm Crowe, who tries to help him - in part to exorcise a  failure in his past.  There was another boy that the psycologist had  treated who was haunted, but he failed to help him.We see this boy at  the beginning of the film, now grown into a young man - tortured and  terrified, the boy blames the psychologist for his years of torment... he  had been promised help by the doctor, and had been left to his demons by a  mis-diagnosis of emotional problems by a man who couldn't bring himself to  believe what his child patient was telling him.  The man, standing shaking  in his underwear, pulls out a gun (don't know where he was hiding that!)  and shoots Crowe in the stomach, then puts the gun to his own head and  fires.The next autumn/fall history begins to repeat itself with Crowes  new patient, Cole.  At first he can see no further than the rational,  believing him to be emotionally disturbed because of his parent's  separation - but just as he's about to give up on him, he reviews an audio  recording of an old session (with the boy who would later shoot him), and  comes across a faint voice that couldn't possibly have been there - a  Spanish voice, pleading and begging - &quot;I don't want to die!&quot;  Then begins Crowes attempts to really help the boy, by finding out what  these visitors want - and if there ever can be a way to make them  leave.If this film has one major flaw its that it skips over its subject  too fast.  The boy is supposed to be tortured, but we only ever see a  couple of ghosts - my sister has seen more ghosts than that!  And if  anything, there's no search for the answer to how to make them go away -  Crowe puts his finger on the solution immediately - and then the doctor's  theory is considered proved by just one ghost.That point aside, this is  one of the better films I've seen, simply for its thoughtful speculation of  the nature of ghosts, and the story's clever twists.  This is the kind of  film Twilight Zone fans will love, but maximum-body-count horror film fans  will probably find weak and slow...Be that as it may, the line &quot;I  can see dead people&quot; has got to be a film line destined to be in the  future books of world's greatest film lines!One last thing - to really  see this film  you'll need to watch it twice!	5.0	Great film, but skipped through subject too fast.	2000-02-18	4	3	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A37B3O457INKEA	Peter Kenney	THE SIXTH SENSE is a very unusual movie about a young boy who has the ability to see and hear dead people. The leading role in the film is that of a psychologist (Bruce Willis) who counsels the young seer (Haley Joel Osment). The movie is helped by an ending with a terrific wallop and a strong supporting cast which includes Toni Collette and Olivia Williams.Much of the success of the film was due to writer-director M. Night Shyamalan. He was less successful in the next year with UNBREAKABLE which also starred Bruce Willis.THE SIXTH SENSE received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Director, Original Screenplay, Supporting Actor (Haley Joel Osment), Supporting Actress (Toni Collette) and Editing. The main competition for awards in 1999 came from AMERICAN BEAUTY.	5.0	Original And Unusual	2003-06-14	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A14JAMNDZXP6QN	Peter T. Winters	Everybody were speaking about it. Sure it was worth speaking about, but  not by so many at the same time. We all knew that it's about seeing dead  people and actually this is the place where the plot ends. It's a film  about seeing dead people.Stephen King's 'Langoliers' was the scariest  movie for me for a long time. Watching it alone in a dark room mady you  shake in your boots; or at least until we couldn't see the little critters,  only hear them and feel the time disappearing. After watching this film I  had to admit that this was even scarier than time stoping. You don't  actually see it, the things that should scare you (like Fred Krueger did in  your childhood), you just feel the tension...and see dead people in their  true light for the first time in your life.Langoliers came when they  were starting the plane and then the magic ended. To me the magic of this  film vanished at an unknown point in the second half of it. I don't know  what was the trigger, but then I realized that it isn't scary anymore. And  even the ending wasn't what it was supposed to be - &quot;gotcha, you  didn't see it coming, did ya?&quot;Now I have seen it many times and it  is still there, the trigger. Even when I watch it in broad daylight I have  to chew at my fingers. (After seeing it for the first time I couldn't stop  imagining that my breath steamed and that maybe I was the only person who  saw some of the passersby on the street, creepy.)Overall: The cast is  great, especially young and very talented Haley Joel Osment. The music is  just the right one for this kinda movie. But the plot has some holes that  my eyes just can't slide over (where was Malcolm during that one year?)Rating: 4.5 (read: Highly Recommended)	4.0	Why is it such a good movie?	2000-05-31	0	0	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A387YJHBU90MT4	"""pezhydrox"""	The Sixth Sense was a good movie.  I feel an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture was probably overly generous (Best Actor, however, was deserved) but nonetheless a fine film.  However the trailers / previews  commented on by others very much irritated me also.  Yes you can forward  through the various trailers as chapters but it is irksome.  I have no  objection to trailers / previews being a menu option, but being forced to  watch them or forced to skip them is frustrating.  I too will not buy  another DVD from this company unless they change this policy.  So then,  four stars for the film, two for the DVD, for an average of three.	3.0	A Good Movie, A Bad DVD	2000-04-11	1	0	1

His emotional range is impressive and I am moved by his consistent, high quality performances. - this was a different type of role for him and he played it well as usual.  The young boy was intensely convincing - I loved him - a magnificent portrayal of a persecuted soul.  Also the director stayed away from clich&eacute;' relationships between American mothers and their children and presented a breathtaking portrait of a sweet child and his loving, caring mom, who, through her own grief and pain, did all she could to keep him emotionally safe and sound..	5.0	Simply a brilliant movie.	2013-09-04	0	0	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AGK4BEIQ017HY	P. I. Johnson	After an increasingly tiresome decade of ironic, self-satisfied and self-referential slashers (of exponentially decreasing quality since Scream), The Sixth Sense comes as manna from heaven (or hell!) for those of us who grew up revering The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, The Omen and the like. Like these great movies - which are its undeniable genre antecedents - The Sixth Sense plays it straight and unembarrassed with its classical horror themes of ghosts, clairvoyance and redemption beyond the grave. Given the brilliance, complexity and intelligence of Night Shyamalan's screenplay and direction, the movie needs no cheap eye-winking gimmicks to capture your attention and hold you riveted until its explosive revelation at the end. This is what going to the movies ought to be about - a compelling combination of intelligence and escapism and - for horror fans - some genuine shivers that far surpass the best of what the teenie-sequels can ever dream of offering. Bruce Willis is admirably low key in a performance of quiet confidence and power, and Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding) proves she's no one note wonder with a performance of the same power and conviction as that of Ellen Burstyn's classic turn in The Exorcist. Haley Joel Osment is surely the best child actor to ever grace the screen and delivers a performance of such maturity, depth and intelligence that its scary in and of itself to think how much this boy actually knows at his age to hit all the right notes so accurately with such adult material (although, here too, The Exorcist provides precedent through Linda Blair). But the accolades of all horror fans will surely go first and foremost to writer-director M. Night Shyamalan who has single-handedly saved the genre from been swallowed up by the sensibilities of the teen horror marketplace. This is - along with the usual suspects in this regard - one of the five best horror movies ever made and a proud asset to my own horror shelf. For classical horror fans wondering whether anything of comparable seriousness and intelligence has been out there during the slasher years, please make a point of also checking out Lewis Gilbert's criminally ignored Haunted (with Aidan Quinn and Kate Beckinsale) on DVD as well - it's everything Jan de Bont's Haunting tried to be but wasn't.	5.0	Classical horror strikes back!	2001-01-23	3	2	1
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A13DQTXG02HZC1	Ping Lim	I think horror movie is not the way to describe this movie.  It's more like a thriller with ghost element in it.  The most frustrating part of watching this movie is to resist the temptation of sharing the ending with  my friends &amp; family members.  The setting of &quot;The 6th Sense&quot;  is spot-on, haunting &amp; chilling throughout.  Just like a good book, the  story gradually flows through rather than hitting the viewers in the face  such as movies like &quot;The Haunting&quot;, &quot;The House on the  Haunted Hill&quot;.  I strongly believe that to make a horror movie works,  it should let the story does the talking, conjuring fear in the viewers of  things they don't &amp; can't see.  Isn't it true that imagination is our  own worst enemy?  Well, &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot; starred Kevin Bacon  shares the same trait as &quot;The 6th Sense&quot; but we shouldn't forget  that &quot;The 6th Sense&quot; is the movie that started it all.  Highly  recommended to watch right in the middle of the night, when you are all  alone.  You won't be disappointed.	4.0	An intelligent adult horror movie	2000-04-29	0	0	0

It wasnt scary, and there was no real climax, it ends you off in a very bad spot,  and never really developes much of a plot.

Why are so many people complaining about the &quot;trailers&quot; at the beginning of the DVD?A. some people like trailers so for some it's an welcome bonusB. DVD remotes come with a  fast forward and some (mine  does) a super fast forward.  Hit this button  and you're past this material in less time than an average TV commercial.  So no one is &quot;forcing&quot; you to watch this stuff.  Me I never even  saw them because I just fast forwarded and assumed everyone else in world  would do the same  thing instead of  whining about it.Oh yes, this movie  is the  opposite of many movies you buy. Ever buy a movie because  you  absoloutely loved it loved it and played it over and over again for several  days/weeks and eventually got bored  with it? The Sixth Sense is just the  opposite.  The first time you watch it you think man that was okay/better  than I expected. You watch it again knowing the ending and say wow that was  really cool how that was set up.  You watch it again and say wow that scene  really fits, You watch it again and say wow here's a &quot;hidden  message&quot;.The only other recent movie that  I can think of that is  like this is LA Confidential in that it is better on each subsequent  viewing.	5.0	Doesn't your fast forward work?	2000-04-10	11	5	6
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2BXYC5Z2TMZY5	p-teK	In a movie world of &quot;jump-scares&quot; and graphic violence used at times only to grab attention and &quot;thrill&quot; the audience, The Sixth Sense is an actual bonified movie, maintaining the genre title thriller while crossing into greatness as more than just a cheap scare or two.The movie opens on a basement- a wife descends the stairwell, picks a bottle of wine and brings it up.  The celebration upstairs is due to the awarding by the mayor to her husband, a renowned child psychologist.  After an altercation with an intruder and a gunshot, we are taken from this bizzare opening to a park bench, the same psychologist, and a small boy. As of this moment we have no idea what this first scene means, and we're off to solve the mystery.&quot;I see dead people&quot;  This line has become a staple of modern cinema.  This, the main plotline to the movie is essential to the enigma.  Are the ghosts harmful?  We're certainly led to believe so, with such terror in the heart of our child lead, Cole- played with excellent skill and soul by Haley Joel Osment.  But this plot actually becomes second to the silent conflict between Cole and Malcolm (the psychologist, played by Willis).  Why is Cole hesitant to ask for help?Watch this movie for the genuine thrills, the awesome acting, the visual inspiration, and the conflict.Oh- and keep track of everything red.	5.0	An actual thriller.	2001-07-31	3	1	2
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1QWXVZYYBZUZV	"""punk_enthusiast"""	Wow.  The Sixth Sense is on the verge of being one of the greatest phsycological thrillers of all time.  Pardon, on the verge of being perhaps one of the greatest movies of any genre of all time.  Shyamalan created the perfect mood at the beggining, maintaining it until the explosive climax.  I was literally palpitating with suspense throughout this amazing tale of a young boy who can see deceased people and a phsycologist's attemt to help him.  Shyamalan has one of the most innovative ideas ever.  It is perfectly carried out by the new &quot;Master of Suspense&quot;.  I recommend this film not only to those supernatural enthusiasts out there.  Oh no, this movie is for all to enjoy.	5.0	Innovative Brilliance	2003-10-03	1	1	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1HVJELFV84ISH	QUEEN_OF_EVERYTHING	"M. Night Shyamalan's THE SIXTH SENSE has ranked high on my list of favorite films ever since its 1999 theatrical release.First of all, it hits close to home.  Why?  First off, Shyamalan graduated from Waldron Mercy Academy, my private Catholic school, back when it was Waldron Academy and all-boys.  Today, the nationally renowned school is coed.  Second, THE SIXTH SENSE is filmed in the bustling city of Philadelphia, PA, very close to where I lived.  I recognized most, if not all of the places shown in Shyamalan's thriller.That said, it didn't necessarily mean I was going to automatically enjoy the film.  At the age of 11, I was hasty to see it.  But my Daddy, as usual, bribed me into it, assuring me I wouldn't regret seeing the movie.""Whatever,"" I muttered as he dragged me to the neighborhood cinema.I had set my standards low.  I arrived in the theatre, expecting a Pepsi, a Hershey bar, and a nap.I was pleasantly surprised.  In fact, I was elated!The talented Bruce Willis takes on the role of psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe, very distinguished in his profession.  Haley Joel Osment, newcomer to the big screen, plays Cole Sear, a disturbed 8 year-old.  His mother, up in arms about what to do with her withdrawn and unhappy son, calls Dr. Crowe to help sort out the situation.  Mrs. Sear, a single parent, is wonderfully played by Toni Colette, who brings life and significance to her character, giving off a near immaculate 3-dimensional performance.Cole is blessed.  Or is he cursed?  You decide.  He has been bestowed/cursed with the power of the sixth sense, a skill both ugly and horrible, in a sense.  Cole, with this magical skill, can help others.  Yet at the same time, his sixth sense haunts him to the point of insanity.  ""I see dead people,"" he eventually explains to Dr. Crowe.  Indeed, young Cole speaks the harrowing truth.  He sees ghostly apparations that haunt him by night and show themselves by day, terrifying and confusing him to no end.  Alas, Dr. Crowe is unprepared when Cole enlightens him with this information.Yet this new knowledge is a beginning for various journeys.  Together, the doctor and his young patient travel to places previously unbeknownst to them.  Their adventures lead them to both saddening truths and irrevocable consequences.THE SIXH SENSE proves to a fickle audience, namely America, that special effects aren't required to make a superb and memorable horror film.  M. Night Shyamalan's unforgettable effort (not his first, FYI) is bone chilling, dazzling, and beautiful, with performances that either launched careers or furthered them.  This film is a masterpiece, no matter how you try to look at it, and it deserved all 6 of its Oscar nods.  Yes, it broke my heart when it didn't win any...Enjoy this thrilling treat, if you haven't already."	5.0	"""I see dead people,"""	2004-06-28	8	4	4

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A30LPUZ753O6V3	"""ratties"""	In my opinion, this was the best horror film I have ever seen. I have been watching horror films since the age of 2 years old, so I have seen many. I mainly like this movie because it was so unpredictable.  There have been so  many movies out there that are good, but too predictable. This one is the  best by far. Another thing that I must note is that I orginally didn't want  to see this movie because it had Bruce Willis in it. I cannot stand that  actor's previous movies. This movie has brought him to a new level of  entertainment. I give this movie the highest rating even though I think it  deserves more than 5 stars!	5.0	The Best Movie of 1999	2000-02-22	0	0	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A24JOL1ZRO0BNZ	Ravenlore	Perhaps it's the fact that the horror genre is not exactly known for  quality that this movie did so well, I'm not sure. Sure, the dark lighting  inhances the creep effect and the little boy who &quot;sees dead  people&quot; (Haley Joel Osment) is very good - But so what? This hardly  saves this predictable and, dare I say, dull, movie. Hats off to the  overrated M. Night Shyamalan for hoodwinking tons of people into thinking  this film is great - That alone is a talent (I think).	1.0	Overrated, overhyped	2000-08-10	18	4	14
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1LC5W7CUQSG1M	raymondlin@tinyonline.co.uk	What can you say about a film with so much publicity, with the likes of Star Wars just came out in the summer, it stayed on the top of the chart longer than any other film last year, Why? The reason being that this is a  great film, even if you don't like horror movies, I suggest you give this a  go. Both Bruce Willis and Joe Osmond is great in this, the script is well  written with a major surprise thrown in. I have to admit that I am not a  major horror movie fan but this is one of the best.	5.0	Unexpectingly Good	2000-03-05	4	2	2

This movie kept me glued to the screen the whole time.  It is very well written and acted.  You actually  felt for everyone.  Toni Collette and Haley Joel Osment were outstanding in  thier performances.  Finally a movie where Bruce Willis actually does some  acting instead of firing off guns.  Don't rent this movie,  BUY IT.  It's  worth every penny and then some.	5.0	Absolutely the best!	2000-03-30	7	3	4

As the credits rolled, I turned to him and asked, &quot;When did you realize Bruce Willis' character was dead?&quot;  He answered, &quot;At the end.  You mean, you knew before?&quot;  I knew Willis' therapist had died when the subtitle read, &quot;One year later.&quot;  If I had any doubts, they were erased as Willis, sitting at a table with Toni Collette who played the mother, got up when her son came home from school.  It looked almost like the old split-screen technique.  There is no horror or suspense here.	1.0	So obvious that you trip over it	2001-01-21	14	5	9
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1LDIMQISH07WK	Rebecca	I just love THE SIXTH SENSE. I missed it out in the theaters, but rented it on VHS and completely fell in love with it. Although I'm hardly ever scared when it comes to horror films, I'd say this is one film that will freak out and terrify most people. But even though this film didn't scare me, I still really loved it.THE SIXTH SENSE is about a child pycholost (did I spell that right?) named Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). Malcolm cares for his patients, but when he fails one patient, a tragedy occurs. A few years later, Malcolm moves to Philideliphia and has a new patient: a 9-year-old boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who has the sixth sense - the ability to see &quot;dead people&quot; or &quot;spirits&quot; and communicate with them. Cole lives with his single young mother, and is frightened by the ghosts he sees because they &quot;make him do stuff&quot;. He wants them to go away, and Malcolm must help him make them go away because he doesn't want to screw up like he did with his last patient.THE SIXTH SENSE is an amazing film with awesome special effects and a strong, solid storyline and well-written screenplay. The acting by the entire cast is absolutely flawless and serpurb. Haley Joel Osment is definitely one of the best child actors I've seen since Macualey Culkin, and Bruce Willis gives off one of his greatest performances ever.I still feel THE SIXTH SENSE should have won some of the Oscars it had been nominated for, and it definitely should have won Best Picture and Haley Joel Osment should have won Best Supporting Actor. AMERICAN BEAUTY is long-forgotten by now, but THE SIXTH SENSE is still popular and excellent.If you haven't seen THE SIXTH SENSE yet, then I definitely suggest you buy this and watch it. It's amazing and thrilling!!	5.0	One of my all-time favorite films!	2001-06-05	3	3	0

I watched it through and then I went through and watched all the special features and deleted scenes. I also watched the rules and clues special feature and then watched the movie again. Each time it will open up new items to your attention but my only bad thing about it is that the music that keep playing is rather annoying, considering I heard it for three straight hours.

His marriage has been failing ever since  an old case that showed almost the same symtoms shot him in the side and  then killed himself.Malcolm is determined not to let that happen to  Cole.This is a remarkable movie with a Hitchcokian twist at the  end.Watch it, and you'll be doing double takes next time you feel that  strange presence behind your back.	5.0	Great acting, great screenplay	2000-01-24	164	146	18

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	ACIJVXJWC1SJO	R. Geatz	For some reason I missed this movie at the theaters, and somehow I managed  to avoid learning about &quot;the surprise ending.&quot;  The movie  captured my curiosity quickly and completely, and I agree with someone  else's post here that I had a sense that something was wrong or was  missing--the revelation at the end reveals that something IS missing, and I  think it was a wonderful technique to create a sense of suspense and  curiosity.  The kid (Haley Joel Osment) is really good; it's so rare to see  child actors who are that convincing. There is a scene in a car near the  end where the kid convinces his Mom that he really does &quot;see dead  people,&quot; and it's done so well that it reduced the two grown men  watching the movie to simpering crybabies. (It's a very emotional scene,  especially if you've lost a family member any time soon.) I usually see  &quot;surprise endings&quot; coming a mile away, but I missed this one, and  enjoyed the process of its revelation--then the pieces fell together and I  realized why some earlier elements were so off-putting. There are also some  excellent &quot;extras&quot; on the DVD version, including scenes cut from  the final film with explanations why (I'm not sure I agree that some should  have been cut); and some early home-made movies by the director when he was  a kid that are hilarious while still indicating the talent that would bloom  later.	5.0	Surprisingly good with great DVD additions	2000-05-30	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1DA91DORI7U5D	"Richard Cody ""witer of fine and not so fine p..."	Prior to viewing this movie I had read many articles and reviews praising it's subtle spookiness, quality of acting and general atmosphere (not to mention the hoopla made about the so called twist ending).Perhaps it was all of this hype that was responsible for my dissapontment with &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;. I don't mean to slight the performances in the film - Haley Joel Osment is exceptional as the boy troubled by visions of the dead and Bruce Willis is suitably poignant in his role as the troubled psychologist. Also, I must commend director Shyamalan for his restraint in regards to &quot;horror effects&quot;. In this age of slash and bleed crap like &quot;Scream&quot; (1, 2 and 3 ad nauseum)any horror movie which goes a thoughtful, psychological route is to be applauded.So, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is well acted and reasonably intelligent. Why then did it leave me cold? Maybe, as I say, It was simply the mountains of hype. More likely it is simply that despite all efforts to tell a good story, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; suffers from too much style and not enough substance - feeling in the end like a Hollywood product and not a work of art. . .. . . And speaking of the end. . . The &quot;surprise&quot; ending of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is something we have seen before (and better)in at least three films I can pull off the top of my head - &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; (1962), &quot;Siesta&quot; (1987) and &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; (1990). But who's counting?&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is a passable evenings entertainment, not a great film and certainly not a great ghost story. This is only my opinion, of course. Who am I to disgree with the hundreds here who have heaped so much adulation upon this movie?P.S. &quot;A Stir of Echoes&quot;, starring Kevin Bacon and based on a novel by Richard Matheson, came and went in the overblown shadow of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; back in 1999.

But the DVD version of THE SIXTH SENSE is an exception.  Assuming you have already seen it in the theater, I know you walked out of the movies wondering what you missed.  This DVD will answer all your questions.See the film again, then watch the director (our Alfred Hitchcock) talk you through the thought process that resulted in this amazing story (he wrote the story, directed the picture, and played a cameo role).  See scenes that were cut from the movie...not just snippets, but full tangents to the main story line.  Hear how the musical score was constructed to complement the unusual story line.  Hear M. Night Shamalyn tell you how he was certain everyone would figure out what was going on and utter his amazement that his dream worked.  Hear how Donnie Walberg lost over 50 pounds to prepare for his short, but very important role.  Hear how this story started as a seed in the mind of a boy and grew into one of the best ghost stories of all time.Be careful what reviews you read in Amazon.com...if you have not yet seen the 6th Sense, many reviews will spoil the entire movie. And it only takes two words to do so.If you don't have a DVD player, get one.  If you haven't seen The Sixth Sense, you must see it.

The  acting is first rate. The sound is good. Hence the two stars. There just  wasn't enough to last for 2 hours. Everything of substance was seen and  heard in the trailers.I found myself wrestless and woozy after only 45  minutes. Then after another 45 minutes I perked up realizing maybe it was  almost over. When it finally ended, my fellow viewer and I stared at each  other in disbelief - &quot;Is That IT?&quot;How could a film that  seemingly has everything going for it turn out to be so gosh-darn boring?

No, The Sixth Sense uses traditional horror movie method to get you reaching for the cushions.The viewer is teased and cajoled through a creepy, enthralling and utterly real experience led by 9 year old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) and child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis).Willis gives the performance of his career, finally revealing a talent for the emotional subtleties demanded of his role.  You'll find no close-ups of a sweat-and-blood soaked face here!Haley Joel Osment has achieved the type of critical and popular acclaim that Macaulay Culkin could never have dreamed of.  His portrayal is so compelling and real that once the movie is over, you find yourself missing his face.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2M66S05KKNSWC	"Rivkah Maccaby ""Rivkah Maccaby"""	Yeah, it does seem an exercise in futility to write the 949th review, but at least I'll be at the top of the list for awhile.First, I'll say that I saw this movie only because I was in the theatre after seeing something else, and when my first film got out, it was pouring rain, so my husband and I sneaked into Sixth Sense, even though we had promised one another not to see it when we saw the trailer. By the way, since then, whenever we see a trailer of a film that looks just gawd-awful, one of us will lean over and whisper &quot;I see dead people.&quot;Yeah, this film was gawd-awful; the reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that Haley Joel Osmant is one of the few watchable child actors working right now.Frankly, I knew Bruce Willis was dead from watching the trailer; I went into the film knowing that from the beginning, and assuming that everyone knew that. It was about twenty-five minutes into that film before I realized that Dr. Mal didn't know he was dead. About fifteen more after that, until it dawned on me that that might be the point of the movie, and then I understood why the film didn't seem to have a plot. I whispered to my husband &quot;Do you think the director thinks we don't know that Bruce Willis is dead?&quot; He just shrugged.At least we got plenty of use out of our refillable popcorn tub and drink cups.I know this film has been getting rave reviews, and I also know that people have dwelt long and eloquently on the film's lack of gore and perceived style.I wonder if audiences are so starved for suspense films (or any films) without dissected teenagers or car-crashing, armor-piercing bullet fests, that anything with a hint of elegance is caught up like pennies tossed to urchins. We've seen people naked, filthy, bloody, mauled by dinosaurs, eaten by each other. Ho-hum. Style, finery, manners, with or without substance is the new hook. It's not that we've suddenly become sqeamish; I leaned forward with everyone to see what was in that rag of Josh's shirt in Blair Witch Project. We're just getting tired of special effects and make-up techs playing &quot;who's got the sausage?&quot;This would also explain The English Patient.

For best effects, watch it in a dark room (or at night) and make sure that the room is cold.I wanna emphasize just how COOL the DVD is.  First is the menu which by itself will give the viewer chills - very  haunting.Now the BEST part of the DVD.  It contains deleted scenes with  an extended ending - each with explanations by the director on why they  were deleted. It also contains this Rules and Clues portion that discusses  the rules they followed in making the scenes for consistency and the clues  they placed to slowly reveal the secret of the movie - all with  explanations.  Other DVDs just have written explanation for deleted scenes.  In this DVD, videos of the director, writer, producer, etc. did the  explanations.Of course the theatrical trailer and the 30 &amp; 15 second  TV spots add to the value of the DVD aside from the other extras.It's  one of those &quot;The way a DVD should be made&quot; type of DVDs.	5.0	Super COOL DVD!	2000-05-31	1	0	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO	Robert Badgley	"In my opinion The Sixth Sense(released Aug/99)is director M.Night Shayamalan's best effort to date.This movie combines wonderfully effective narrative ""trickery"" which sets the viewer up for a shocking,unexpected and powerful one-two punch of an ending.The films stars Bruce Willis as Dr Crowe,a renowned psychiatrist who lives in Philadelphia,PA.Having just received a prestigious award from the Mayor he and his wife are celebrating upstairs when an intruder is discovered.Dressed in all but his underwear the intruder continuously yells that the doctor let him down.What little Dr Crowe can glean is that this man in his youth was a former patient of his.As he switches into doctor mode trying to calm him,he pulls a gun out and shoots Crowe in the stomach.The scene next switches to the home of the Sears;single mom Lynn(Toni Collette) and her only son Cole(Haley Joel Osmont).Cole is a shy,picked on and bullied nine year old who is very troubled.He is carrying his pent up frustrations and thoughts around with him and keeping them all from everyone,including his poor mother.Dr Crowe enters the picture and decides to take little Cole on and try to help him with his dilemma.Over time and with patience Dr Crowe is let into Cole's world who admits to him that his secret is that he""sees dead people"".At first Dr Crowe is incredulous but over time he comes to believe Cole is actually seeing these things.One day at a party he and his mother attend,some bullies lock Cole in a small cubicle at the top of a winding staircase.His mother rescues him but he is taken to the hospital unconscious.The doctors find marks on his back and think his mother has abused Cole.It is these marks and other indications that Cole gives to Dr Crowe that makes the doctor think the ghosts may be trying to communicate something to him.When one night a small girl appears to Cole she tells him to go to her home,to her room and retrieve a small box.Cole,accompanied by Dr Crowe go to her home where her wake is in progress.Going to her room the girl gives Cole the box which he takes to the father.Inside is a tape which reveals that the wife had deliberately poisoned/murdered the poor girl.Dr Crowe and Cole have come to the realization that all these entities ever wanted was someone to listen to them.On the way home the next day Cole is with his mother in their car.An accident has occurred up ahead and the traffic is backed up.While waiting for it to clear Cole finally lets his feelings and his secret out to his mother.He tells her that someone got killed in the accident ahead because the person is standing next to his window.Then he reveals he can talk to ghosts and tells his mother that his grandmother often appears to him.In fact he imparts a message,from the Grandmother,to her only she could have ever known about.In tears both hug.Dr Crowe and Cole come to a parting of the ways as he has done all he can for Cole.The doctor's wife and he however appear to have become estranged and he pays a visit to his home.His wife is asleep on the couch and he sits beside her.Suddenly his wedding ring falls from her hands and he suddenly realizes he hasn't been wearing it.He thinks back to what Cole said that ghosts sometimes ""see only what they want to see"".Dr Crowe never survived the shot at the beginning of the movie!A video of their wedding is playing on the TV and he tells his wife he must go,letting her move on with her life and telling her he loves and misses her.The impact of that final moment cannot be understated.It is like getting a sledge hammer between the eyes.The director skillfullyweaved the story in such a way using every narrative trick in the book to throw us off the scent and he succeeded in spades.It brings two concurrent plots into alignment and successfully resolves  each characters dilemmas;each divergent character helping the other in their own way.Wonderful film,beautifully written and executed.Technically the film has been transferred well into its' 1:85:1 a/r.Extras include:storyboard to film comparison,,cast info,music and sound design,a look at the ""rules and clues"" in the movie,deleted scenes with an alternate and extended ending,interview and intros by the director,filmmaker and cast bios and a bit on publicity for the film.This top notch edge of your seat film includes many elements such as drama,love,thrills and pathos all wrapped around the subject of ghosts.Its' famous ending will leave you gasping and its' stars Colletee,Osment and Willis all turn in Oscar caliber performances throughout.This is highly recommended."	5.0	Still M.Night Shayamalan's best effort so far!	2010-10-12	6	1	5

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A4E8PK8PIY1ON	Robert E Hunt Jr	Having seen and *loved* this film during its theatrical run, I pre-ordered this DVD nearly two months in advance of its earliest availability.  When the disc arrived, I immediately canceled all other plans and set aside that  evening's hours to watch it.Imagine then my profound sense of  disappointment when I saw the first preview come on.  Instantly, I reached  for the DVD remote and pressed the Menu button only to find it had been  disabled.When the second preview followed and still the Menu button  was dead, I started to feel annoyed.  By the time the fourth one began, I  was thoroughly and completely angry and pledged never to watch any of the  four movies that had been forced on me.Yes, I will admit that once The  Sixth Sense began, the experience was every bit as satisfying as I had  hoped.  And the extra features are a very nice bonus.  I don't doubt that  this disc will be played many many times before I tire of it.However, in  the end, the forced previews ruin this disc.  I would have been happy to  watch any previews the disc producers wanted me to watch ... so long as  they gave me the freedom to choose when to watch them.A fatal mistake.  Simply brutal.  This disc should be recalled and replaced with one that  does not force the experience.  At this point, this studio is in my  doghouse.  If they pull this stunt again, I will never buy another disc  from them.This is one Collector's Edition that may become a Trash  Collector's edition.	4.0	Mandatory Previews Ruin Much Anticipated DVD	2000-03-31	78	66	12

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	APB68OSCKURL	Robert	Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis team up to make this a teriffic film. After seeing this film numerous times, there are two scenes that stand out as unforgettable and making the movie worth seeing. In one scene Cole  (Osment) has to decide whether he should lie to his mother and confess to  an act he didn't commit or tell the truth and say that &quot;a ghost did  it&quot;. The expression on his face shows a hurt and agony I thought only  a veteran actor could produce. In the other, Cole has a secret to tell to  Malcom (Willis) and is ready to tell it. When the scene ends you wish there  was something you could do to rid this angel of his demons.  M. Night  Shyamalan directs a masterpiece of darkness and suspense. This film is a  wonderful character study, proving that you can make a great film without  resorting to gore or multi-million dollar special effects. Unlike most  &quot;who-dun-it's&quot; that can only be enjoyed once, the ending of this  film had me go back several times to see how it was done!	5.0	Willis and Osment in a class film	2000-02-16	0	0	0

In Peru this DVD was released on MArch 25, this is very strange for us to see DVD releases before USA.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1JIPFV4OL520T	Robert Wynkoop	I was listening to the Movie Show on Radio one Saturday as I was working on my truck, when I heard Mad Max Weiss mention that The Sixth Sense had one of the most surprising endings of any movie.  That did it, I had to rent it.Staring Bruce Willis as child psychologist Malcolm Crowe and Haley Osment and the disturb child Cole Sear, The Sixth Sense is both a psychological thriller and a horror movie at the same time.  Terrifying visions of dead people haunts the child, Cole. He has learned to repress what he sees for fear of being called insane.  So at first, we see it as a psychological thriller.  Later, we learn that the visions are real, so perhaps we are watching a horror flick, but as the move progresses it never degenerates into a silly horror movie, but keeps its psychological edge.Although Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors, I am afraid that I have underestimated his acting ability.  This is an outstanding movie that grabs your attention and does not let go until the final credits roll.  And the ending, oh yes, it was a surprise- I did not see it coming.  If you have not seen this movie, rent it now.  You will want to watch it several times.  It is that good.  Not a movie for the faint of heart or your wee ones- it will give them nightmares for a week; but if you are looking for a first rate psychological thriller you may want to add this to your DVD collection.	5.0	first rate psychological thriller	2004-07-04	2	1	1

Had this movie been filmed in any other city than Philly it would be a two star flick (Bruce Willis seems  to enjoy playing guys named Cole who live in Philly). If the script had  been dumbed-down to appeal to a wider audience - one star. What we have  here, folks, is one of the rare movies where just about everything was done  right (forget about the &quot;surprise&quot; ending - you'll figure that  out a half-hour into the film). M. Night Shyamalan has learned the most  important word in horror filmmaking - ATMOSPHERE. Makes one hopeful for the  future of scary flicks.	4.0	Creepy fun in Philly!	2000-07-13	1	1	0

This is a movie of exceptional storytelling. This powerhouse thriller achieves a runway victory on the basis of sheer  storytelling excitment. Mr M. Night Shyamalan, the wrtier and director,  wields this suspense like a stiletto. Night knows just where to stick it  and how to turn it to grab you the audience. Bruce Willis and the boy,  Haley make this ghostly film work. The ending to the film will show that  Bruce Willis charcter is also a .... I can't give up the clues here, you  got to go see the flim.The building to the end of the film will blow you  away. I would say to any fan of a good suspense book, you should not miss  this one.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8	Roger J. Buffington	No spoilers here--I will only say that this is a film that the viewer must watch more than once to fully appreciate and enjoy.  This is a powerfully done, well acted and well told supernatural thriller that is several cuts above most films of this genre.  Excellent performances, great direction, and a very creative storyline make this film one of the most impactful thrillers I've ever seen.Put simply, this is the story of a young lad (Cole Sear, young Forrest Gump) who possesses a terrible gift--he can sometimes see dead people--sometimes passive images, sometimes more than that. A child psychologist (Bruce Willis) tries to understand what is tormenting the young man, since the true explanation is quite unbelievable. But there is much, much more to the story, but it is not my place to tell it here.  Sufficient to say that most viewers will be impressed and moved by this powerful and frankly scary movie.One complaint--the scene dealing with the deranged mother (no spoiler here) I thought was needlessly depressing and upsetting.  Well, it upset me anyway, and has detracted from my enjoyment of subsequent viewings.  Others may differ in their opinions, but that is mine.A movie that will hold the interest of almost all viewers.	5.0	Moving and powerful.  Several cuts above most thrillers.	2003-06-27	6	3	3

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2GEB05H8G2Z5A	Rolltide	This is a movie that is only truly enjoyed with the first viewing. Once you fiqure out the characters by the end the movie loses it's lustre. In subsequent viewings everything seems too obvious. I'm trying not to give away the ending or the jist of what happens but the ending shouldn't have  been included in the first place. The ending ruins the mystery. Without the  revelations at the end the movie would have more staying power. Those who  have seen it will know what i mean.From an entertainment perspective the movie is great. The acting is good not great and the  directing is superb. The scenes and camera angles really enhance the tone.  There are some cheap attempts to startle you and keep you on the edge but  they don't over do it. The cole character is totally unrealistic. This is a  little 9 year old boy who sees dead people! Most of these dead people bear  the injuries of their demise. One visitor is a boy with half the back of  his head blown off who asks cole if he wants to play with a gun. Despite  this cole is no complete basket case. Rather he is courageous and almost  serene at times, even when he is telling the willis character that these  visions may have the intent of doing him harm. At times this nine year old  who sees dead people talks like a psychologist trying to analyze himself.Never the less this is a fine movie with thrills and mystery. In the end  cole achieves some healing with his mother as he reveals his secret.  Finally his visions seem to have served a good purpose. You must rent this  movie.

I've been a fan  of bruce willis for some time, he  does an outstanding performance here, no die hard, just great acting. My  wife and I watch a good number of movies, and so often something looks good  on the rental shelf only to be dissappointing after a 1/2 hour.I also  think DVD formatt for this movie is a must, it really brings out some of  the great special effects.

When little Cole Sear reveals his secret by quietly saying, ""I see dead people,"" gooseflesh ran up my arms and cold, wet feet danced along my spine. Child actor Haley Joel Osment is superb as the lonely, frightened little boy who has a gift: he attracts dead people who come to him for help.

Five stars PLUS!I watched this movie all the way through, saw the interviews at the end of the movie and then rewound the movie and watched it AGAIN.I don't think I've ever done that before in my life.To call  this a horror flick is *wrong*. It is intelligent, well acted, articulate,  thought provoking and immensely intriguing. The only gross scenes are the  dead people who &quot;hang around&quot; the school and other places.The  ending caught me completely off guard. What a way to end a flick.Is it  possible that someone (like a child or an older person with a child-like  thought) could see dead people?In the many books I've read about life  after death, folks who've passed and been revived frequently make comments  that [while they were 'dead'] &quot;the dog kept running around me and  barking but no one else in the room even knew I was there.&quot;Dogs  (and children?) have that simple pure thought that sees through the veil.The moment this movie comes down in price, I'm snagging a copy for my  very own. This one is a keeper. I'd count it among my top ten favorite  movies of all time.It is an intelligent flick.

Knight Shyamalan and his psychological and powerfully thrilling film The Sixth Sense gives us in much  respect what The Exorcist did.It shows life and death in a way that it makes you think of how to deal with them by seeing it  through a warn out child pyschologist Dr.Malcolm Crowe who is  unsucessful with an earlier patient that ends up tragically ,  with a burnt out marrige that is all but failing and his wife seemingly hurt and angerd ingores his presence.When Dr.Crowe decides to throw himself into his work by taking a case with a hypertensive boy named Cole Sear he begins  to feel proud of his work.But when Dr.Crowe befreinds young Cole  and begins to make progress in figuring out how to help Cole he  tries deperately to figure out his own problems with his wife.Coles mother grappeling with the fact that shes loosing her  son , makes Dr.Crowe go deeper into the case until Coles shocking announcement to Dr.Crowe &quot;I see dead people&quot;,Dr.Crowe figures he  could be going through parinoia or schiezophrenia but when Crowe  find the proof of the young boys gift they will both find that  Coles gift will take them to unforgettable or unforeseeable and intense consequences until it leads up to the emotional,chilling and intense suprise ending.What you get from this film depends on what you bring out of it if you beleive in life and death and spirtuality then you will find that the film reasures that, if you don't then it will be an thought provoking film enough to make you start thinking about life and death and sprituality.Nominated for several awards and  best picture , best director it has all around great acting but  the performance from Haley joel Osment is briliant,sweeping and  inteligent.Interviews with the cast and crew on making this film sevral segments on the film with the crew and the effect of the movie twords people.Great acting by Bruce Willis,Toni Collete also.Get this chilling DVD and you won't be sorry you did.	5.0	Quite frankly the most stirring thriller since The Exorcist.	2001-01-09	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AM2PV53UX1JEQ	R. Penola	It is heartening that a Hollywood movie with few special effects, superb performances and an intelligent, moving script can succeed amidst the bang-em up and shoot-em up thrillers of the summer season.  Mesmerizing,  melancholy and searing, The Sixth Sense is one of the few movies in recent  years that provides that elusive element of genuine, thrilled surprise -  the kind that makes you reel backward and feel that tingle at the back of  your neck.  Haley Joel Osment brings such an intense power to the role of  Cole that you believe every word he says, and feel his torment down to your  toes.  Toni Collette embodies her role, a working-class mother, with  empathy and truth.  And Bruce Willis defies his action hero image in a role  that literally aches with pain.  There is much power in this fanciful  story, and the movie is thought-provoking without ever being over-the-top.  You will find it difficult not to be moved to tears in the film's final  moments.	5.0	EXCELLENT AND MOVING	2000-04-18	2	1	1

What impressed me about this movie was simply the fact that time was taken to invest in the characters and their problems (and that's not called &quot;slow-paced&quot; in my view, it's called &quot;character development&quot;).  This is one of those ghost stories that goes beyond a run-of-the-mill thriller, both visually and emotionally.  The DVD special edition here has pretty much what was available on the previous release (which was pretty good in itself), including three new documentaries on the film.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2GT89YH31GLWC	"""russellvlad"""	For the first 30 minutes or so, I thought I was going to be pleasantly surprised by this movie.  The acting is generally pretty good and the photography, while not exactly groundbreaking, is intelligent and nicely  done.  The direction of the actors is pretty impressive, too, and  occasionally even unique.  I can see this director making a really good  film at some point if he pays a bit more attention to his script.  Unfortunately, midway through the movie it's already apparent that the  story just doesn't make any sense.  The &quot;twist&quot; ending is fairly  easy to figure out before the end and is both intriguing and then silly  once you think about it.  It certainly doesn't wrap up much of anything in  the movie.  I had quite a few questions at the end --- most of which could  only be answered in ways that would seriously upset the dramatic structure  of the picture.  Bruce Willis is fine --- he basically steps aside to let  the kid do his business.  Toni Colette is excellent as usual --- quite  effective in a relatively underwritten role.  The kid is impressive, but  seems to have picked up a few bad habits early.  He is really ACTING --- he  seems like an adult actor, which is the main reason he impressed so many  viewers.  I'd be curious to see what he can do with a different director.  I only hope he doesn't get ruined by the Hollywood system, because he does  seem to have the potential to become a really great actor.  Quite  sensitive-seeming.  All in all, the movie was pretty entertaining ---  definitely held my interest.  It just didn't make a lot of sense; I'm all  for a bit of ambiguity, but the things that were ambiguous about this movie  seemed to be the result of laziness.  I feel a little bad accusing a  filmmaker of laziness --- perhaps he's just more interested in other  aspects of filmmaking.  Everything except for the script does seem pretty  darned tight and thoughtful.	3.0	Entertaining enough	2000-05-27	4	1	3

Night Shyamalan was only known (just barely) for one movie up until this point,Wide Awake, so this was definitely unexpected.The movie features Bruce Willis as a child psychologist who sees a patient (Haley Joel Osment) that can speak to dead people.  The movie wnet on to score five Academy Award nominations and a place on AFI'a 10th Anniverary list.This version of the DVD, the single disc version, features a number of featurettes and deleted scenes, definitely worth a look.Highly recommended.	5.0	An Unexpected Hit	2007-09-21	2	1	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A37O59DLEGDNTQ	SardonicCynic	Okay, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is far from being one of the worst films of 1999, but's definitely not one of the best either. It's a pretty good film, but the hype surrounding it is excessive, and not to mention,  undeserved. I didn't really think of it as a horror movie, more of a drama  with spooky undertones, and that is why the film disappointed me. The whole  ghost aspect of it was quite weak, like it had no power or energy . Sure it  had an eerie atmosphere, and one &quot;jump&quot; scene, but that was  pretty much it. The film also felt kinda wooden at times, and generally  moved at an all too slow pace. However, negative points aside, &quot;The  Sixth Sense&quot; boasts some good performances and a strong emotional  sense. Bruce Willis is good, but it is Haley Joel Osment who steals the  show, his performance as the tortured boy is flawless. I also found the  film to be quite moving, especially the last scene between Osment and his  mother. The famous &quot;twist&quot; at the end is also something to  appreciate. So in all, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is pretty good, it's  strengths overcome it's weaknesses, but unfortunately, media hype has made  it out to be a better movie than it actually is.	3.0	Overrated, but still worth watching - 7/10	2000-02-12	17	10	7

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1E3BUSVZKA1K6	Scott Davies	This movie is the most commercially motivated, ridiculoussellout of a film. I went to see it opening weekend. I thought I wouldfinally see a decent horror flick, after all the other trash I've had to suffer through in the horror genre recently. The first 1/3 was decent drama, building the story. The second 1/3 was pretty good suspense. The last 1/3 destroyed the whole film. The whole concept of the boy essentially becoming ghost psychiatrist was beyond stupid, and removed any previous aspects of horror.  Having ghosts appear to say &quot;Tell dad that mom put draino in my soup&quot;, and the like, was just dumb. Had it all been evil intentions, the movie would have been much more effective, in a positive horror movie way. I can't wait 'til the sequel, when they run even shorter on ideas and have ghosts appear saying &quot;Tell Aunt Edna that the car keys she lost in 1984 are behind the clothes dryer&quot;. The awful &quot;Grandma visits me and tells me she's proud of you everyday&quot;, was so motivated to mass appeal that I was sick. Always have to have that little irritating &quot;heart warming&quot; touch, don't they. Watching disfigured ghosts walk away from the boy after their &quot;session&quot; made this movie look more like a bad comedy! The final scene was completely unforgivable. I was amazed at what a huge hit this garbage became, but considering what movies do become hits I should have expected it. Simply AWFUL! The horror movie has died a slow, painful death over the past decade. This movie is the perfect example.	1.0	Biggest sellout of what could have been a good film!	2000-06-15	27	8	19

Bruce Willis plays an award winning phsychatrist and Haley Joel Osment beautifully portrays a  fatherless child who sees ghosts. A run in with a former patient that is  very disturbed starts off this epic tale. Osment is treated by Willis to  help control his special gift. Boys don't like him because he is differnet,  they add to the diffuclty of dealing with his problem. His mother is  doesn't beleive that he can see ghosts until he proves himself. In treating  him Willis discovers something about him that may chill you to the bone or  warm you to your boiling point.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1WFEHAV42HTM5	Scrimshaw	"In an era of cinema filled with stupidity, trashiness, violence, and cruelty, The Sixth Sense manages to stand out, for it's own time and even more so today, as a stunning example of serious cinema at it's finest. The Sixth Sense, written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan back in his prime as a director, is a psychological horror/drama which focuses on a troubled 9 year old boy named Cole Sear, played exquisitely by Haley Joel Osment, who is able to see and interact with dead people, and his relationship with an equally troubled child psychologist Malcolm Crowe, played by Bruce Willis. While this film is often advertised as a horror movie in reality it's more of a supernatural drama with elements of psychological horror, or to put it more specifically, a drama film with some scary scenes thrown in. Just as there are comedy-dramas or tragicomedies, films which are basically dramas with some extra humor added in to lighten the overall mood, The Sixth Sense is a drama film with some horror added in to demonstrate fully to the viewer the terrible effect Cole's ""sixth sense"" has had on his life, rendering him a tortured soul with no one to turn to for guidance or consolation since many people don't even believe ghosts exist let alone have the ability to see and interact with them! While there are in fact many thoroughly frightening scenes in this film, this film had me crying more than it had me frightened, and I can't remember the last time a ""horror"" movie did that. So even if this film had some cliched scares as one person said in a Youtube review I saw, it still succeeds as a powerful, tragic drama focusing on common human fears and concerns such as our fear of death and the unknown, most people don't understand Cole, they label him as a freak and would probably call him that even more if he told them about his sixth sense. Malcolm, who's having problems of his own, in addition to having a young boy telling him that he can see ghosts, now has added anxiety to deal with as he slowly starts to believe that Cole may be telling the truth after all when he looks back over some old audio recordings of his old patient Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg), as a child, he realizes that he may have been afflicted with the same ability that Cole has, which is why he ""failed"" him and why he broke into Malcolm's house and shot him in the opening scene. Overall, The Sixth Sense is a gripping, suspenseful, emotional, dramatic, and scary film that is much more than a simply ghost story, it's a film that asks the question of whether we truly ever die and what happens to us and the people we love after we die, do we truly ""die"" or does some part of us live on, possibly to suffer and linger from unfinished business on the earthly plane, or simply unable to move out of the darkness and into the light."	5.0	More Drama than Horror, But Still Excellent	2013-03-22	0	0	0

His ability  as an actor shines through in his role as Malcolm Crowe, and Haley Joel  Osment is wonderful in his role as Cole.  A heartfelt hooray to Toni  Coltette as Cole's mother.  She brings the torment of her dealings with  Cole's &quot;problem&quot; right into your home.  Anyone who wants a  &quot;hold your breath until the end jaw dropping thriller&quot; should see  this film.  Be prepared to jump, laugh, cry and be amazed!

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2B7BUH8834Y6M	"Shelley Gammon ""Geek"""	"For those who have seen the movie in the theater, but want to share it with friends or just see it again to see if the director messed up anywhere w/ the plot and surprise ending, this DVD is the way to go. There are many features packed into the DVD that make it work a purchase and not just a rental.For those who haven't seen the movie and don't think this film is really their genre, I strongly suggest seeing the film for just one reason: Haley Joel Osment. This kid is absolutely the most incredible child actor on the scene today. He is so believable as the troubled Cole Sear, the realization that you're watching a film vanishes. Toni Collette's performance as Cole's mother is also riveting.The DVD is feature packed, but my less than perfect rating comes from the forced commercials. You can not skip them but are forced to fast forward through them. Don't get me wrong, I love movie previews. I get to movies early so I can see them, but every single time I pop in the DVD? That's fine for a rental, but not when I have paid the purchase price for a disc, should I have to endure 15 minutes worth of trailers before getting to the menu! I had some friends over a few nights this week and every group that came over wanted to see this movie and every single time we had to sit through half a dozen movie previews.Despite the forced commercials, this was a great film. A story of troubled spirits, in this world and the next, all looking for love and understanding. Seeing Cole's life as the misfit in school is all too reminiscent of how heartless children can be to other children, and how other children can be easily crushed, humiliated and tortured, without the help of dead folks walking around to boot.The deleted scenes are powerful, but it's understandable why they were cut. Watching the first film by the director that he shot when he was 12 is cute and inspiring to young filmmakers or young people with any high aspirations. If a kid can make a movie that cheesy and a few years later (M. Night Shyamalan is not yet in his 30's!) come out w/ ""The Sixth Sense,"" then a determined potato can be the first spud in space if properly determined!For Osment's performance alone, this is a must-see. Excellent work by all involved. The ""rules and clues"" feature of the disc will help those who want to watch the film over and over again."	4.0	A DVD Review	2000-07-29	6	5	1

The film also cleverly  includes the sub-plots of ethical issues as well as poignant, misting-up  scenes like the car accident-related scenes where Cole reveals his mother'  s childhood secrets to her.Where death drives the plot, love somehow  finds a way for apart lovers as well as bridges life and death to discover  hidden truth-in-itself, and the world beyond our clear scientific  explanation exists, The Sixth Sense is certainly the BEST THRILLER / HORROR  of 1999.Have a nice day. - SP	4.0	THE SIXTH SENSE: The Best Thriller / Horror of 1999	2000-05-11	9	5	4
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AXTS0PEDIRUIX	"""shofar"""	Like a well told tale, The Sixth Sense first captures your attention and then leads you little by little to the twist at the end of the film.  A successful child psychologist is shot by an ex-patient who claims that the doctor has failed him in that he was unable to rid him of his fear.  This ex-patient, who is now an adult, claims that he knows what causes our fear when we are alone.  He does not elaborate, but then shoots the doctor and then turns the gun on himself.  A year later we find the doctor attempting to help another child who exhibits the same symptoms that the ex-patient had, apparently in order to try to redeem himself from his incapacity to help the first patient.  Only this time around, the doctor now knows that the child's  fears stem from his supernatural ability to see and communicate with people who have died.  Fine acting by the three main characters.  No gore, but this film did make the hairs on my arm stand up.	4.0	A well told tale...	2001-06-24	1	1	0

But all this hooplah over Sixth Sense has got my boxers in a knot.  Sixth Sense is an orginal film with strong technical merits and a solid plot line.  But it does not come close to living up to all the kudos and attention the public has lavished upon it.  First of all, the big &quot;secret&quot;.  I don't know about everyone else but I figured out Willis was dead inside of twenty minutes.  I mean talk about a surprise that was hardly well-concealed.  Secondly Haley whats-his-face.  That kid needs to tone it down a few notches.  His milky voiced, wet-eyed look just doesn't sell me.  Thirdly, okay The kid again, I Do Not Like This Kid.  I suppose I have to make this point twice.  It seems that the movie-going audience is easily enthralled with a cutesy-wootsey sadfaced child regardless of the weaknesses of his acting abilities.  I have two words for you McCaulley Culkin.  Look, don't get me wrong, the Sixth Sense is worth seeing, but it is hardly worth the praise it received.  Personally I'll take Unbreakable over the Sixth Sense any day of the week and twice on Sunday.	3.0	One of the most over-rated films of all time	2001-01-12	17	1	16

The acting in this movie is top notch, especially the little boy, Haley Joel Osmont, who outshines Bruce Willis.  While this movie is very stylish and well done, don't expect it to scare  you too much, its more of the kind of movie that the acting and the story  keep you interested.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2VCXMDL2ZEI24	"""skyswimmer"""	Before I begin, a WARNING: DO *NOT* LOOK AT THE &quot;SPECIAL FEATURES&quot; FOR ANY DVD BEFORE YOU WATCH THE MOVIE!! Perhaps this goes without saying for many of you, but I have this vision of all these people unwrapping their shiny new Christmas DVD players, and saying to themselves, &quot;I gotta try this thing out, but I don't have two hours for the movie... hmm... maybe the storyboards will give me a quick clue.&quot; Don't do it for any DVD, and especially don't do it here. The Sixth Sense has a fantastic surprise ending (I flatly disagree with the reviewer who said anyone could see it coming), and if you watch the storyboard feature, you'll find out what it is in the first two minutes.Other reviewers have covered the movie itself quite nicely (plot, casting, and so on), but I haven't seen any detailed commentary on the bonus DVD material. The items included here are a pretty good Hollywood 101 assembly. If you want to learn how the director, the producer, the editor, the cast, and all the other folks who put these films together do it, watch the special-feature stuff. I haven't seen the whole process laid out any better than this, although some of the individual &quot;how we made it&quot; elements are better in other DVDs.I suggest watching the special features in the order they're listed on the case's back cover (I think-but I'm not sure-they're in the same order on the DVD menu: Storyboarding -&gt; cast -&gt; music &amp; sound design -&gt; reaching the audience -&gt; rules and clues (this one's great!) -&gt; deleted scenes -&gt; conversation with Shyamalin (like most &quot;conversations w/the director&quot;, this is kinda bloated--but still interesting) -&gt; publicity. The sequence is logical, although not quite chronological; and you'll learn a lot about how the hit-making machinery meshes with art. It doesn't always work, but in the Sixth Sense it does. In sum, it's a good look at how they made a movie in the twilight of the 20th Century.One note about the film itself: I'm not a Bruce Willis fan by any means, but I will give the man credit: he understands the role of his character completely. Other reviewers mentioned that Willis stood back and let Osment occupy front and center. I'm inclined to give Osment and Shyamalin more credit for that than Willis, but it would've been easy for Willis to let his character dominate the scenes. Instead he made what seems to be a conscious, deliberate effort to recede, and for that he deserves credit.	5.0	Hollywood 101 -- or, how to use the &quot;Sepcial Features&quot;	2000-12-29	4	3	1

The (alleged) ability of some people to see the dead is well-known enough that  there are numberous scientific, new-age-y, theological, psychological, and  even layman's books devoted to the subject--but this film acts like none of  that exists. I know movies aren't reality, etc., but it wouldn't have taken  more than a few minutes for the Bruce Willis character to stop at the  library and pick up a book or two on the subject (and no, I'm not a  lobbyist for the National Library Association :).	4.0	Try your local library, buddy	2000-04-06	2	0	2
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3IEH1OHJPYULA	smokie	This has been the first movie that has almost had enough intelligence to scare people.  Yes, other movies have scared people but those are older movies against older crowds.  In an era of slasher films and gore  splattered houses, we have a pg-13 movie that does the trick.  They  coordinate the music in such a manner, there is no way you won't jump when  you see this movie for the first time.  The good acting and realistic  script give this movie a real sense like this is real, not acted out by  people for money.  M. Night Shyamalan has finally done his dream of making  classic film.  Bruce Willis has done a good movie with out having to kill  people, although I doubt he will be able to do another.  The sequence they  show the scenes is planned and in a precise order to add to the suspense  til the last frame, which leaves you in awe and a feeling that you have to  watch the movie again, just one more time. After you watch this one several  times, you may notice significant things, like the colors.  An example that  is pointed out on the dvd is the color red, red shows that something  significant is going to happen. Not to spoil it but red is visible in all  the key scenes.  This movie is truly one to be checked out, how many  horror/suspense movies can be opped for an academy (best picture). If you  see this and disagree with me, find a better horror movie and spread the  word, if you say The Blair Witch is better than this, I'm might just have  to smack you.

He is a  completely polished actor; he has all the appropriate facial expressions,  tones of voice and pauses. He is truly a one-in-a-million find.Bruce  Willis plays a dedicated child psychologist (Doctor Malcolm Crowe) who not  only works great with Osment but also does an excellent job balancing  helping Cole, who &quot;doesn't want to be scared anymore,&quot; with  getting his marriage back together. This is very challenging because they  hardly speak anymore. (The fact of him always coming home late doesn't help  matters.)Toni Collette who plays Cole's Mother couldn't have been  better if she had practiced her lines for 5 years! She shows so much love  and support for Cole; she is an ideal role model for all parents. One of  the last scenes of the movie with Cole and her in the car is some of the  best acting I've EVER seen.The acting, script, direction, music, sound  effects and cinematography work together in complete harmony to make this  movie EXTRAORDINARY.This is the first movie I've watched that was so  unpredictable that as soon as it was over I immediately rewinded it to  watch it again!THE SIXTH SENSE IS IN MY OPINION THE ALL-TIME BEST  THRILLER EVER MADE.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	ADEW9NW1HGTNJ	"""songbear"""	There are so many things right with this film it is hard to know where to start. First the acting is the best I have seen in any kind of suspense/supernatural thriller/horror film since &quot;The Exorcist.&quot; Bruce Willis turns in his fine performance on the level with his performances in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;12 Monkeys.&quot; He is an intense, loving husband, and caring helper. Toni Collette and Haley Joel Osment finish out the main trio of actors, both turning in Oscar-worthy performances that suspend disbelief and bring you into to the wide range of emotions used on the director's and screenwriter's palette.Then there is the story. There are layers and layers to this story, yet the director carefully unravels them to a climactic ending that in the hands of a lesser director could have ended up being one big mess. M. Night Shyamalan lets us feel Cole's pain and torment without resorting to the sappy music and emotional manipulation used by many other popular directors. He develops the relationship of Cole and his mother, essentially a subplot, and weaves it seamlessly into the main plot where you can hardly tell the two apart. The delicate relationship between Malcolm and his wife gives the audience insight into the vulnerabilities of Willis' character. Scary with a heart.The soundtrack is understated but extremely effective. Eerie and chilling. And the DVD version has more special features than 95% of the new releases on the current market. You will understand more about how this movie was made after seeing the special features from storyboarding to marketing. Since special effects weren't too important in this film, there isn't an hour-and-a-half special effects documentary like the one included in &quot;The Mummy.&quot;This DVD is a great addition to any collection.

Unfortunately, the settings for the film are way too bland and anonymous.  My biggest complaint is the fact that the movie never takes off, the  beginning is promising but I was always expecting something more to happen,  it just seems to spend two hours in first gear and never anymore than that.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2UW83R0JOZZ6	S. Schell	August is typically the month chosen for studios to dump films considered too poor to compete against the bigger summer vehicles and too weak to war with fall releases.  The irony of &#65533;The Sixth Sense&#65533; being released during this month is all the more peculiar when one hears of its $8 million triumph on opening day, not to mention curtailing a $30 million mark its first weekend.  Screening amidst blockbusters like &#65533;Runaway Bride&#65533;, &#65533;The Iron Giant&#65533; and the much-discussed horror mockumentary &#65533;The Blair Witch Project&#65533;, the success of &#65533;The Sixth Sense&#65533; surprised not only its skeptical audiences but its humble filmmakers as well.Action buff Bruce Willis stars as the unruffled child psychologist Malcolm Crowe, a man who has spent the last ten years devoting his life to the mental health of Philadelphia&#65533;s troubled children.  After ogling a plaque of commendation given to him by the city&#65533;s mayor for his painstaking services, he and his wife Anna (Williams) retire to their bedroom, drunk on wine and ready for a romantic tryst.  To their surprise, they find their window shattered and their phone beeping urgently off the hook.  A half-naked intruder lurks in their adjoined bathroom, a gleaming handgun lying dormant in the sink.  The intruder tearfully reveals himself as Vincent Grey, a former patient who never found peace.  Malcolm desperately tries to placate the hysterical young man but Vincent fires a round through his abdomen before turning the gun on himself.The story leaps to the following year, the incident having irrevocably damaged Malcolm and Anna&#65533;s marriage.  Unable to repair the breach in their stunted communication, Malcolm busies himself with a new client, one whose traits are eerily parallel to that of Vincent.  The enigmatic youngster this time &#65533;round is Cole Sear (Osment), an oft-morose elementary-schooler whose permeable eyes disclose the terror and mysteries of the netherworld.  Not only is Cole oddly intuitive but he also has the power to see and communicate with restless phantoms, entities that consistently make their presences known in the dusky apartment that he and his mother Lynn (Colette) share.  Both Malcolm and Lynn assume Cole&#65533;s behavior is rooted in the emotional pangs of his parents&#65533; divorce, but they are sorely mistaken and one day the terrified tot exhales &#65533;I see dead people&#65533; to the stone-faced shrink, a rivulet of tears cascading down his porcelain cheeks.  It is at this point that Shyamalan grabs us by our shirt collars and pulls us closer towards the portico of restless spirits, revealing to us their many macabre but misunderstood worlds.This subdued paranormal yarn literally became a theatrical juggernaut overnight and many people were compelled to see it a second or third time just to spot director M. Night Shyamalan&#65533;s clues to the gasp-inducing denouement.  I remember sitting in the theater with my husband and hearing him incredulously whisper &#65533;Holy s**t!&#65533; as the last five minutes of SS unfolded, hitting the audiences&#65533; collective realization like a sledgehammer.  Like the rest of the world, I was mesmerized by 11-year-old Osment&#65533;s unbelievably mature performance and I admit I was a little disappointed when he didn&#65533;t even receive an Academy Award nomination for his flawless work. However, I didn&#65533;t overlook the rest of the cast&#65533;s efforts and I was very pleased by the performances from both &#65533;Die Hard&#65533; trilogy star Bruce Willis and his Australian co-star Toni Collette (who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress).  Willis had ventured into chancy territory before undertaking the complicated role of Malcolm Crowe, choosing character roles like high-strung mortician Ernest Menville in the black comedy &#65533;Death Becomes Her&#65533; and quirky car salesman Dwayne Hoover in the Kurt Vonnegut-adapted &#65533;Breakfast Of Champions&#65533;.  Collette had a shorter but nevertheless impressive resume, Shyamalan having enjoyed her as Muriel Heslop in the 1994 comedy &#65533;Muriel&#65533;s Wedding&#65533;.  Olivia Williams hopped onto the project after starring in the Costner flop &#65533;The Postman&#65533; and the independent comedy &#65533;Rushmore&#65533;.  The biggest casting surprise however was former &#65533;New Kids On The Block&#65533; member Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent Grey, the ex-singer-turned-actor barely recognizable due to his emaciated physique (he shed a dangerous total of 45 lbs. for the part).Some people complained about knowing the secret only halfway through, saying Shymalan made it too easy to guess what was going on and/or gave too much away.  Only the people who allowed themselves to be consumed by the director&#65533;s languid but intriguing style and the riveting performance from Osment were shocked, but they were pleasantly surprised as well by how carefully he concealed the truth.  So to the critics who pieced together the theoretically palpable puzzle: good for you.  Just don&#65533;t ruin it for the rest of us who would prefer to enjoy the film for its imagination and talent rather than embarking on a rabid search for its technical flaws.	5.0	Spirited by Shyamalan	2001-08-23	5	3	2

This is the type of horror movie where you won't find bloody killers, tons of special effects, etc.  The gross parts of this film is probably some of the gruesome ghosts.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3I69IXPTDVKQF	Stephen B. O'Blenis	Among the best ghost stories ever told, The Sixth Sense succeeds mightily as a horror movie, a relationship drama, and a spiritual thriller.  In arguably his best role, Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a dedicated psychologist still haunted by his inability to help a disturbed patient who later took his own life.  Years later, he's in for the challenge of his career when he meets a deeply frightened and disturbed little boy named Cole (Haley Joel Osment, in an award-worthy vituoso performance) who seems at first to be plagued by the same kind of mental problems that hounded Crowe's former (later suicidal) patient.  Part of his determination to help Cole is to try and redeem himself for what he perceives as his failure in the other case, but most of it is that he just puts his all into it for every case, and Willis is great at projecting the compassion and fear he feels for his new young patient who continues to spiral deeper, while Osment is just magnificent as a lovable little child who's scared out of his wits by forces beyond his understanding, and not knowing who to trust, or who's ever going to believe him.  Both actors elicit tremendous empathy for their characters, and the supporting cast shines pretty brightly too.The doctor bit by bit learns more about the nature of the boy's delusions, carefully prying little hints and pieces of information out of his scared charge without forcing it and driving him deeper into his shell.  But Dr. Crowe may be in for far more than he ever bargained for, as he begins - almost against his will - to have to consider the fact that Cole's fears may not be delusions at all.  The scene in which Cole finally confides the truth of what he 'sees' with his special sense to the doctor is an absolute classic.  As Crowe tries to help him - and tries to figure out exactly where he stands on what he's beginning to suspect (which is everything his training has told him not to put stock into), Cole begins to sense a purpose behind his experiences and begins trying to understand what's behind the whole phenomenon, and what his 'role' in it is.Excellent from start to finish, and if you're one of the few people on the planet not to already know the genuinely shocking twist ending, that's all the more reason to get it and see it as soon as possible.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A37F8W82A1E6L7	Stephen Cords	We saw The Sixth Sense in a theater last year just as the public was discovering this little gem.  Some magazine my wife had read blew the ending for her, but she still cried up a storm.  The film is THAT moving.  I have to agree with the Amazon Staff Review.  The excellence of this film  is in it's execution.  The plot has been utilized over and over again.  Some one (in this case a little boy) is seeing ghosts and has to perform  services for them so that they can &quot;move on&quot;.  At first the kid  is thought to be disturbed, but with the help of his psychiatrist he is  able to come to terms with his gift and move on with his life.  Think  Ordinary People meets The Haunting.How this film is shot is where the  payoff comes from.  The use of camera angles and perspective is amazing.  The cabinet scene made us both jump out of our chair and there was no  special effect.  Just good film making.I had heard a rumor that a sequel  may be in the works, but not for a few years so that the kid playing the  lead character can grow up a bit and reprise his role as a teenager.  I  vote yes for this.  It could prove a very interesting follow up to a great  film.If any of this film's nominees read this-  Good luck at the Golden  Globes and see you at The Oscars!	5.0	All I can say about this movie is WOW!	2000-01-07	4	3	1
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2G2ZB5KB1AM9Y	Stephen Daly	Don't get me wrong.  This DVD is fantastic, but only because it contains such a great movie. If you've seen the movie, you might get excited about the &quot;extended ending.&quot;  Forget about it--you'll be disappointed.  What they consider the &quot;ending,&quot; which was what is extended, is  already too long. The deleted scenes add little if anything to the movie.  What struck me about these scenes is that, had they been included in the  film, they might have ruined the you-know-what.  Had these scenes been  included, I have a feeling that this movie would have come and gone without  anyone noticing. The director's commentary is nothing more than a few  comments about various aspects of the story, and what it took to pull them  off on film.  A movie-length commentary would have been interesting, though  not terribly so. If you haven't seen this movie, get it on DVD.  DVD is the  perfect medium; it would have been just as good a DVD if it contained  nothing more than the film.  The ability to re-view the movie and skip  around to different scenes is something you'll appreciate after you've seen  this fine film.	5.0	Excellent Movie -- So-so DVD extras	2000-03-30	0	0	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A17OHZWCQ6WI0J	Stephen E. Lore	As a Bruce Willis avoider I would recommend this video because there appears to be a shift in Mr. Willis' character deliverance.  Up until now Mr. W. appeared to be a bone headed tough guy with an affinity for  delivering the same character over and over in most of his craft.  I made  the decision to see this movie because I had seen an interview with Mr. W  and he made sense for the first time.  He appeared to have some insight  into his own life and the role he has at this time. Perhaps he needed to  get away from Demi!	4.0	The Sixth Sense	2000-01-13	35	15	20

Choosing Bruce i thought would be a bit dodgy as we were used to seeing him in the Die Hard films, but he rose to the challenge and was fantastic and worth all the money he was paid.  Im glad that Toni Collette was chosen as she is my favourite actress, and she has already taken on various different roles before(Muriels wedding, Emma) so i knew she would be able do the role justice.  The film has an excellant story line about a young boy who sees ghosts and seeks help from Bruce Wills.  What happens through the film is some of the best effects i have seen in a film of this standard and without giving too much away, i would like to say that this film has a twist at the end that more or less makes the film`	5.0	Well Casted	2001-01-01	2	1	1
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3MEGCL9WU0U1R	Stephen G. Melvin	In this summer's proliferation of scary movies, The Blair Witch Project got all the hype, The Haunting got all the fancy schmany special effects, and The Sixth Sense won the acclaim of moviegoers and critics alike. This  film is the best of the new crop scary movie flicks (the aforementioned, as  well as Stigmata and Stir of Echoes.Willis plays a kiddie shrink who  failed once and is determined not to make the same mistake for the special  but troubled little child played by Osmet (Forest, Jr. from Forest Gump).  However, he can never be prepared for the revelation Osmet makes to him. In  a scene that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end he  confesses to Willis in a raspy whisper, &quot;I see dead  people.&quot;What progresses are a series of images that are lackluster  in special effects, but so well-set-up they will literally scare the hell  out of you. It is a non-stop adrenaline ride from then on out. For the  first time since I saw The Exorcist at 16, I felt uneasy when I cut the  lights off and settled into my bed.There are some holes in the plot and  a few melodramatic moments, but all in all this movie is fantastic. There  are two particular bright spots that outshine its other traits, however.  The first is Osmet. A child of his age in such a role would normally play  it very melodramatic and unconvincing, but he is soft-spoken and as  realistic as any other actor I have seen. Because of his age, I think this  is one of the best performances of the year (nuge, nudge, Academy). The  other bright spot is the twist at the end that will literally make your  head spin. Never duplicated, totally unpredictible, you will walk out of  the theatre shaking your head in disbelief. That is all I will say about  it.Overall, this one is a must see. Just keep that heater running as hot  as it will go when you get home. Brrrrr...See more of my reviews at  [...]	4.0	A cut above the shallow horror genre	2000-01-14	1	1	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AI0MXXUR866II	Stephen Pospisil	When a child psychologist (Willis) is shot by a former patient he begins to reconsider his treatment ideals. The redemption for his failure he seeks in his newest patient (Osment) who displays emotions and fears far to familiar to the former failure.M. Night Shyamalan may not have had any  truly notable films before this endeavor, but with &quot;The Sixth  Sense&quot; he establishes a strong foothold in the Hollywood circle. His  clever and absorbing storyline stands as only a small piece of this  elaborate puzzle. The true force driving the film is its focus on  character.Instead of following the traditional paths of the  supernatural, or wandering off into more obscure areas, the movie remains  simple and focused, always studying the characters and their reactions to  the situations. It never goes out of its way to thrill the viewer, all of  the thrills come from the terrified, charming face of Osment.Who could  have figured a child would outshine a major Hollywood name, perhaps only  Shyamalan did. Haley Joel Osment steps on the stage shortly into the film  and immediately fills the surreal atmosphere of the past with a vigorously  subtle mysteriousness. Claiming to see &quot;dead people&quot;, Osment is  wrought with woe and fears, but the caring child is hardly concerned with  himself. In fact his greatest fear is for his mother how his unusually  cruel situation is slowly driving her toward madness.While Willis  strolls through the movie with a believable and serene atmosphere (until  the end's final twist, which is questionable when considering some of the  previous sequences), he is always several steps behind Osment's truly  formidable presence.Never does the pace excell, nor does it let up.  Slowly and carefully it spins the story that intertwines these somewhat  &quot;lost&quot; souls and the unique ending situation that binds the duo.  Certain scenes provide gasp-worthy reactions at just the right time to  prevent the movie from slacking, but never does it let these scenes drag  into a horror oriented atmosphere.A clever use of colors (examined on  the DVD's extras, which are quite nice and provide a decent length of bonus  material), some tender and affectionate dialogue, and deeply realistic  characters keep what could have been just a &quot;decent&quot; movie at the  &quot;terrific&quot; level. Rather, Osment should be mostly credited with  the true praise, his performance simply swept the screen.	4.0	Intelligent, Well-Paced Suspense	2000-05-02	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A239C7RR4W0E15	Steve Cataldo	I wanted this dvd for some time now, and now that the dvd is released, I'm happy.  When I turned it on, I was intriqued at the previews.  This is the first dvd where I've ever seen previews in it.  But,preview aside, I think  this dvd is definitly worth being on top of anyone's list.  The action may  not be at the top, but not all great movies have action in them.  Like  Saving Private Ryan.  Just Kidding.  But still, this movie is about a  little boy named Cole who has the power to see the dead and communicate  with them.  A psychiatrist(Bruce Willis) tries to help him with his power,  at first not believing him but then he comes to terms with his doubts and  realizes this boy is special.  This movie sets the stage for a great ending  that hits you like a Yankees homerun caught on your nose.  The surprise  you'll have to see for yourself, but I do STRONGLY recommend this dvd to  anyone who wants a sure to be must have for all families for all times to  come.  This dvd is acceptable for ages above 8 in my opinion because there  may be some scenes in which they may get scared, and there is a little(VERY  LITTLE) blood in it.  But for parents, you will not get embarresed watching  this dvd with your children.	5.0	MUY BUENO/VERY GOOD	2000-03-29	0	0	0

The deleted scenes weren't that interesting and I can see why they were cut.  You don't really lose much. The director explains why he cut scenes which  was nice. I think the film would have lost its edge if they were included.  The interviews with the director was very interesting watch out for this  guy I think he's up and coming.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AZCDCO6KK2T81	"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan"""	"SPOILER ALERT:  Before reading this review, please know that this film is a complex psychological mystery to figure out and in the course of discussing this film's merits some pieces of the puzzle may be revealed inadvertently.  I often refrain from this with reviews, but it's hard to discuss this film without giving away some critical elements here and there.  Please be advised of this as I hate to spoil anyone's enjoyment of this modern classic film that you really must see and own if you are a fan of this genre.After two rather lame, dorky films M. Night Shyamalan hit it big with this 1999 sleeper that quietly went on to become one of the biggest box-office surprises of that year and this genre and rightly so.  It is the kind of film that Alfred Hitchcock (Psycho) would have been proud to put his name on.  I'll forego the usually plot analysis here as most are familar with this film and Amazon's description of the film says enough.The film's strengths lie in the wonderfully subtle performances by the stars who all rightly deserved their Oscar nominations.  I still consider this one of Bruce Willis's best performance if not best, but with a career that easily bounces around from comedy to action hero to thrillers it's hard to really say what is his best.  In any event, his role here as the tortured child psychologist trying to make up for a past wrong is compelling and rather typical of any Hitchcockian-type thriller (considerVertigoas a great example).  Haley Joel Osmont, whose sister was inSpy Kids 2and on the current Disney showHannah Montana, gives a marvelous performance and one of the best I've ever seen from a child actor.  His eyes are truly the windows to his soul.  Toni Collette as Osment's grief-stricken, single mother is flawless, believable at all times, and heart-wrenchingly touching as she attempts to communicate with her child that she believes may be beyond reaching.In addition, the film's delibertly slow-mounting pace mixed with sudden unexpected jolts brings about incredible tension and suspense.  Shyamalan is brilliant at slowly giving us the pieces to the film's puzzle to the point where we feel, as the audience, like complete idiots for not ""getting it"" sooner.  Why didn't I notice that no one talks directly to Willis's character except the boy and why does he keep wearing in some fashion the same clothes (plus or minus tie, plus or minus sweatshirt or sport jacket, etc.).  The ending of the film is telegraphed to us earlier on and we are given countless clues, but like any skilled director, Shyamalan often misdirects our attention elsewhere at critical times.  His is a very gifted director and writer who can effectively bring his vivid imagination to the screen.The photography, camera angles, lighting, and careful editing manipulate us from beginning to end and the score by James Newton Howard who gave us the theme toERand the awesomely effective score to Shyamalan'sSignsis always appropriate and memorable as a score should be.  In addition, the make-up for the ghosts that only Osment can see is jolting and convincing each time and often surprisingly revealed to us.  Their presence is eerie, disturbing, and, forgive the pun, haunting.My only complaint about this otherwise flawless piece of entertainment is that it is, as some critics have rightly pointed out, a rather contrived work, but most good mysteries are by the nature of the genre itself and not so much because of the writer and director of which Shyamalan is both.  The pieces of the puzzle HAVE to fit at the end and to criticize the film for doing so seems a bit unfair, but I do understand what those critics mean as Shyamalan is a bit heavy-handed with his contrivances, but, wow, can he tell a story.  If you are interested in his other works, then just click his name highlighted as director.  Except for his first two silly films and the troubled and uneven but still decentLady in the Wateryou should enjoy this master director and writer.FYI: This film was the inspiration for two popular and current TV shows.  They are NBC's highly successfulMediumin which Emmy-Winner Patricia Arquette is a housewife that sees ghosts in her dreams that want her to assist them in some manner and CBS's equally successfulGhost Whispererwith Jennifer Love Hewitt playing a similar role, but see ghosts all day long and not in her dreams (more like in ""The Sixth Sense"").  These are series worth owning by the way.  I never miss an episode of either show."	5.0	A bit contrived, but riveting entertainment.  A must-see, must own film!	2007-06-28	5	2	3

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AS1KQ8H27S80Z	Steven Kuroiwa	I am not a fan of either Bruce Willis or most modern American movies.  I only rented M. Night Shyamalan's &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; because I read that the movie was supposed to have a great surprise-ending.  &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is an average thriller.Child psychologist Bruce Willis is shot and wounded by an angry former patient who later kills himself.  About a year later, Willis finds that his marriage is crumbling and comes across a young boy(Haley Joel Osment) who seriously needs his help.  Osment has a special talent that allows him to look into the past.  He is also haunted by spirits and says that Willis is the only person who can help him.&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is a so-so thriller.  I wasn't satisfied with the first two-thirds of the film but the last third is great.  The last third of the film is genuinely heartfelt and stunning.  As a child actor, Osment gives a good performance but I didn't think his portrayal was Oscar-worthy; his character's emotions seem too affected at times.  I also wish the film would have gone into much greater detail about the dead girl-ghost character who asks Osment for his help.  If anything, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; certainly has a GREAT twist-ending.  The surprise ending is both logical and intelligent, and I didn't come close to guessing this conclusion beforehand.  The surprise conclusion significantly helps in elevating the film.Despite its weaknesses, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; should be seen by every movie buff at least once.  For a superior thriller with an even greater twist-ending, see Robin Hardy's &quot;The Wicker Man.&quot;	3.0	An Average Film With A Great Twist-Ending	2001-08-05	8	4	4

With this and his more recent ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"", M. Night Shyamalan has taught us to be more sophisticated in our viewing, revived our sense of cinematic wonder, demonstrated that thrillers and `family values' movies need not be mutually exclusive, and, more simply, given us three ripping yarns.  Like the best novels, his films are utterly riveting, beautifully crafted and, at their heart, have something important to say.  What more could you possibly ask?

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3U56M0Y8LYO6J	"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict"""	"M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" is a noteworthy example of how the technique of misdirection can be employed in cinema.  However, the mere use of misdirection does not guarantee that a film will wind up being any good.Psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) returns home one evening after receiving an award for his work with children.  A former patient awaits him there and shoots him in front of his wife.  Time passes and Crowe tries to put the incident behind him by immersing himself in a new case.  Crowe takes on a new patient named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who claims that he is able to see dead people around him.""The Sixth Sense"" created a sensation upon its release as filmgoers relished its twist ending.  Yet, if the truth be told, the ending will not come as a surprise to fantasy and science-fiction fans or to those who are actually paying attention to the events unfolding onscreen rather than sitting back and just going along for the ride.  The entire success of ""The Sixth Sense"" hinges on whether you are able to figure out the ending ahead of time and unfortunately Shyamalan's use of misdirection just does not mask the final revelation effectively enough.  From the beginning of the film, one knows that something is amiss and the twist becomes more and more obvious as the story continues to unfold.  The acting is first rate with Willis, Osment, Toni Collette, and Olivia Williams turning in great work.  Willis in particular turns in an interesting performance that is a departure from his more action-oriented roles.  However, even with all the quality acting on display, you just cannot shake the feeling that the ""The Sixth Sense"" is essentially just a drawn-out ""Twilight Zone"" episode when all is said and done."	2.0	"""I want to tell you my secret now."""	2005-09-25	9	4	5

Bruce Willis seems to be on a roll these days, so I started out a little tired of seeing the same actor in yet another movie.However, like  the other movies he was in, this one did not disappoint me.  It started off  somewhat slow. Very interseting, but the movie didn't keep up with the hype  I had been hearing.That is until the ending.  The final 30 minutes or so  made the entire movie!  It even changed my feelings about the beginning of  the film.  If anyone begins to tell you about the movie, tape their mouths  shut and watch it!  If you feel it starting out slowly as I did, and want  to put it off, DON'T!  It is by far one of the best pieces of art I have  seen in a while!

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3VCFKG8PVV0CO	Stingray Ramone	"What surprised me most about The Sixth Sense is how cerebral it is considering that after all, it is a horror film.  It is not exactly a horror film, because obviously, there are no unrealistically macabre sequences and the ""dead people"" aren't menacing or sinister, whose unfinished business is to kill and destroy, but to serve as guides of compassion.  However, The Sixth Sense is a horror film, in that it grips you psychologically, that leaves you with an unsettling feeling in your stomach.The Sixth Sense is a story that is founded on the relationship of Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), a highly acclaimed child psychologist and Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a disturbed nine year-old of whom is bestowed the gift and or the curse of communicating with the spirits of the deceased.  The story starts off with Malcolm and his wife, Anna (Olivia Williams resting comfortably at home.  Their peace is interrupted, when an intruder, who turns out to be one of Malcolm's former child patients by the name of Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg), breaks into the couple's bathroom.  Now as an adult, Gray is distraught and suicidal and he exacts a measure of revenge on Malcolm before taking his own life.  Bouncing back a year later, Malcolm encounters the extremely sensitive, troubled Cole, who is an unhappy outcast amongst his peers because of his paranormal psychic ability.  Looking to dispatch the lingering emotional pain of watching and ""causing"" Vincent Gray's suicide and its effect on his life, especially his marriage, Malcolm urges Cole to confront these spirits and to pick up on what they want.  Meanwhile, Malcolm attempts to mend his marriage with Anna, because she simply would not talk to him and in the mouth-dropping climax which is quite reminiscent of the Ambrose Bierce short story, ""An Occurrence on Owl Creek Bridge"", he discovers the shocking truth on why.Even though The Sixth Sense boasts outstanding performances turned in by Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, M. Night Shyamalan's exquisite directing and storytelling is what makes The Sixth Sense stand out as one of the best films in 1999 and in the horror film genre.  What is even more effective to the purpose of the film is the thought-provoking conclusion.  If you have not carefully observed the film, scene by scene, the movie invites you to re-evaluate and reconceptualize the story and its events and it demands you to watch the film over and over to attain a deep understanding of its concept, without losing its awesomeness and splendor simultaneously.  All in all, The Sixth Sense is not horrifically gory and much more cerebral.  If you crave the intellectually challenging thriller flick and a much more macabre presentation, then I highly recommend Seven.  Either way, The Sixth Sense is a well-rounded, must-see flick which does not stop provoking thought and providing chills."	5.0	Very Intensive Thriller that leaves you with a Big Chill	2003-06-17	0	0	0

The interview with the filmmakers afterward was a great bonus.  The twist at the end is  brilliant, but what makes it even more impressive is that when you watch it  through the second time, you see that the movie plays absolutely fair by  its own rules, and the established rules of the ghost-story genre.  The  entire plot makes perfect sense in light of what you now know.  Like  everyone else, I don't want to spill any beans, but for second time  viewers, here's one more clue to watch for: mirrors.  Keep an eye on  mirrors!Casting Bruce Willis against type was a stroke of genius; as for  Haley Joel Osment, he is just amazing.  Any child actor can play  &quot;cute,&quot; but he plays a character who is definitely not cute, and  not easily likable, and wins us over completely.	4.0	Good casting, great plot	2000-05-18	0	0	0

I just watched it again and was amazed by how well rendered the entire  movie is and how Shyamalan plays totally fair with his ""surprise"".  I just hope he can recapture this magic of SIXTH SENSE in the future as his other films have been very disappointing.  I'm not usually a fan of Bruce Willis in his action roles but he is just perfect playing Malcom in this much quieter movie.  Child actor Haley Joel Osmont is nothing short of remarkable in his role as the ""disturbed"" Cole.  Philadelphia, a city I never think much about, comes alive and I now want to visit it and see the historic sites.  And there is really a pretty nice spiritual message for a ""ghost"" story.

She was scared in places and wanted me to turn it off, but after it was over, she was intrigued and kept asking &#34; why did such and such happen&#34; and &#34;what did you think about...&#34;. One characteristic of an excellent movie is that you think about it for days.  She repeatedly asked to discuss the movie over the next three days. We were both glad she watched it. The movie was also a catalyst to discuss things like death, the soul and the meaning of life for us.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2CIVC2AT3CYWP	Sylvilagus	"The Sixth Sense is one of those movies that younger audiences or audiences unfamiliar with a lot of movies will see as new and innovative, even shocking as so many below have indicated. If you have more experience with movies, much of this one will be familiar to you (yawn), it certainly will not surprise you or shock you.I first saw The Sixth Sense long after its theatrical release and so was quite removed from all the hype; I just remembered that many reviewers had described it as an intelligent psychological thriller. I was disappointed.The so-called ""twist"" involving the Bruce Willis character was no surprise at all. In fact, it was fairly obvious almost in the very beginning, and later the director used so many awkward techniques to maintain his ""illusion"" that it became glaringly so. Try re-watching the scenes when he interacts with the boy's mother, or when he meets his wife for dinner. These are done very clumsily. Anyone remotely familiar with this type of storyline can't help but realize what is going on. Part of the problem is that the film is built around this Twilight Zone twist but as a full length movie it has to struggle to maintain the illusions far longer than a 30 minute TV episode, and ultimately fails. Another part of teh problem is that the ""twist"" itself isso hackneyed. I can't remember all of the various stories and films that use this device, there have been so many.That having been said, there are positive points to the film. Bruce Willis, who has a very limited range as an actor and no depth, does a descent job here, for him. Don't avoid just because of past experience with Willis. The troubled boy is played spookily well. Some of the scenes are genuinely unsettling, though the director steals a lot of the scariest more atmospheric moments from Kubrick's The Shining. The subplot surrounding the murdered girl was more interesting than the movie itself, if a bit syrupy towards the end.Overall, if you are an experienced movie-goer, this one might hold your interest for an evening after work, if you can get past the annoyingly clumsy handling of the ""twist"" scenes. If you are younger and looking for a spooky night and maybe some new-to-you twists, enjoy!"	3.0	Not terrible but way over-rated	2006-07-28	17	0	17

Several persons haved revealed those secrets in the reviews posted below.SEE THE MOVIE before reading these reviews.This is perhaps the most gripping film I've ever seen.  Here I  was, sitting in the theatre enjoying splendid performances.  Little did I  know that the director was toying with my feelings, brilliantly sending my  perceptions of the story in one direction, only to receive a shocking  realization of what was actually happening.  Even the great Roger Ebert, in  his review, admits that he was taken in hook, line, and sinker.  I still  can't stop thinking about this movie.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A15OJWNE8J3WQS	Taylor Sapp	I'll start out by saying that THE SIXTH SENSE was one of the most effectively creepy and affecting movies of its year. Bruce Willis gave a surprisingly capable performance, and Haley Joel Osment did an excellent job of handling a very difficult role.  The success of this movie did seem a slight bit overwhelming though. To me this is a good but not great movie. My first problem with this movie was (don't read on if you haven't seen the movie), is that aside from the clever gimmick of the ending (which reflects back if you watch the movie again), this is a strong but standard thriller film. It's well written, but not particularly creative, and the end gimmick, as compared to say, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, is really kind of pointless if you really think about (more than anything, it shows the craft of a smart screenwriter). And finally, this movie suffered from a lack of buzz compared to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, as both came out at similar times. THE SIXTH SENSE, came out without a great deal of hype, soon after the aggressively marketed BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. As a result, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (which I feel is much creepier and disturbing) suffered from a backlash, while this movie came out at the perfect time to recieve the opposite.  Anyways, I do like this movie a great deal. And, it's definitely a movie that should be seen more than once. But &quot;One of the best films ever made?&quot; Please. This is an entertaining and worthwhile film, but it is a bit overrated.	4.0	Extremely strong--if slightly overrated film	2000-09-23	4	3	1

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A34U3YP0DGBJ79	"""tee-vee-stevie"""	Having just finished watching the movie I feel compelled to write this review, a meagre attempt to give something back to the makers of the movie. This is one of the hardest reviews i've ever tried to write, words do not  seem capable of conveying the ingenuity and gorgeousness of the Sixth  Sense.  I'm not going to talk about the plot, to analyse it would give away  too much, so this leaves only my feelings about the fim to convince  you.I still feel somewhat astounded by its intelligence and mesmerised  by its beauty. I know such descriptive words are not those which one would  normally associate with a film of its kind but that's what makes the Sixth  Sense different.  The plot is what binds it to the supernatural/suspense  genre, but the actual story makes it so much more.  Take Poltergiest, Ghost  and Good Will Hunting, these are three very different films, each a classic  in their own right. If you were to mix these you might end up with  something close to the Sixth Sense: an original supernatural thriller, with  excellent character development and relationships which is not too big to  have an element of romance.  Brilliant displays by Bruce Willis and Haley  Joel Osment gives the film its edge.Technically the Dvd is also  faultless. Picture and sound quality are excellent and there are two pages  of special features which have thoughtfully been put together.I can  offer you no more than my assurance that this is a film that I believe will  appeal to all. It is an emotional journey, which will leave a lump in the  throat and a chill in the spine of even the most hardened of persons... if  not, check your pulse!	5.0	THANKYOU, THANKYOU, THANKYOU.	2000-03-30	22	17	5

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AXFPFO28Y04BW	Thanos6	The Academy was insane, that's all I'll say.  Giving piece of garbage &quot;American Beauty&quot; Best Picture?  Competent, but not exceptional, Michael Caine receiving Best Supporting Actor?  Etc...They were insane.  &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; should have swept the Oscars, and would have if the Academy wasn't comprised of a bunch of hypocritical snobs.After two mostly overlooked features, &quot;Praying With Anger&quot; and &quot;Wide Awake,&quot; M. Night Shyamalan (who should have won both Best Director and Best Writer) firmly implants himself in the national consciousness with this thriller of a movie that will have you guessing at every turn.  Also, now that his &quot;Unbreakable&quot; was shown to be just as good, it has been established that Mr. Shyamalan is far from a one-hit-wonder.Tak Fujimoto does some of the best cinematography work I've ever seen.  Words cannot describe it.  He manages to make the coming of dawn seem frightening, simply by showing us shadows and light playing over a statue.  Dawn.  The traditional horror movie's time of safety becomes, in Mr. Fujimoto's very capable hands, just as dangerous as midnight.  He is assisted by James Newton Howard's eerily unsettiling score.Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, and Olivia Williams all do great jobs, but the actor who stole the movie is young Haley Joel Osment as the child who &quot;sees dead people.&quot;  If you don't feel sympathy for him, you need to have your sympathy gland inspected.Highest possible recommendation.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3TFFSO47Z3BX8	"The Bluto ""adncjs3"""	Last year's &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is a very unique film in that it's both a very scary supernatural tale and a sublime story of friendship.  The film stars Bruce Willis as a childpsychologist with a traumatic past who decides to counsel a disturbed little boy named Cole Sear who is played by Haley Joel Osment.  Cole has a special gift that most adults wouldn't want; he can see and hear ghosts.  Willis then tries to help young Cole to cope with his ability and live a normal life.This film has a very interesting premise, but more than that perhaps it's strongest asset are the strong performances by Haley Joel Osment and the underrated Bruce Willis.  Osment gives a star making performance showing an almost scary amount of maturity for a young child.  As for Willis, he gives his most earnest and best performance to date showing what a fine talent he really is.  While most of the story centers around Cole's performance, Willis doesn't try to outshine his young co-star.  Instead he shows the younger actor much respect by reacting and listening to him instead of out-act him.  Much recognition should go to Willis for Osment's performance, and for his own as well.Another great ability Willis has is having complete trust from the audience.  He has always utilized this talent in his &quot;Die Hard&quot; films and other action adventures, but it has never been so useful than in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;.  We react to his humanity has he tries to heal this sad little boy, and we sympathize for him has he desparately tries to mend his marriage.  Being as huge and important a star as Willis is, he shows restraint from turning this performance into a star vehicle.One more wonderful thing about &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is the writing by director M. Night Shyamalan.  This isn't a trendy thriller with 90's gimmicks and one liners.  However, this film has undoubtedly become a trend setter.  Many of the films wonderful plot turns come naturally and are done with great care as to show the audience that these aren't artificial scares and suprises.&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is a film like &quot;Ghost&quot;, an emotional supernatural tale with a suprisingly sweet heart.  There are emotional responses from the audience ranging from genuine fright to overwhelming suprise and delight.  It is because of these wonderful suprises and performances that &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; may reaffirm your belief in movies.	4.0	Effective thriller with great performances	2000-12-13	2	1	1

As time wore on and the public accolades pilled up my initial acceptance erroded as this supernatural TV movie was propelled by it's ending twist to &quot;excellent&quot; status and an Oscar nod for Best Picture, pushing out superior films (&quot;Cider House&quot; did that too, but not so much). The most blatent loser in all of this is the overlooking of the true best movie of 1999- David Fincher's mindblowing &quot;Fight Club&quot;. Politics of both films aside each's biggest selling point is there remarkably similar reality-redefining twists and it's at even this point in which &quot;Fight Club&quot; comes up resoundingly superior. In terms of sheer deception (but with plenty of clues along the way to make you feel stupid) it buries &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; in ambitousness and even sheer length. Fincher not only perfectly intigrates his twist into the story, but it also perfectly coincides with the self denial of the character and the spirit of Chuck Palahiuk's novel. The difference is Fincher's twist is intrigal to the effect and overall message of the story, while &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; is meerly a nifty trick. A second viewing of &quot;Sense&quot; is a different side of the same coin, while &quot;Fight Club&quot; is almost a whole different movie whose double meanings and manipulation make &quot;Sense&quot; look even childish.	2.0	The Kizer Soce Effect	2001-03-11	20	8	12

It starts out when this mentally ill guy starts going crazy. Then the dead people thing. What's best is that the character for seeing dead people was frightened at first. Also, he was at the church on part of it when both of 'em find each other. Well, the end I can't really describe.

Night Shyamalan film I've seen, the first having been ""Signs"" (the plot of which ended up luring me in and blowing me away).I already had a general idea of the plot of ""The Sixth Sense,"" but I didn't actually expect to be lured in and blown away a second time. And that's exactly what happened.As with ""Signs,"" the resolution of ""The Sixth Sense"" caught me completely off-guard and had quite an impact. I'd heard about an unexpected twist at the end, but that's all. Fortunately, I'd managed to avoid all spoilers. (Whew.)I sometimes joke that ""Signs"" is the first ""alien"" movie that's ever moved me to tears (call me sappy, but it's true). Now I can joke that ""The Sixth Sense"" is the first ""ghost"" movie that's induced me to start bawling like a little kid - not because I'm scared, but because I genuinely feel for the characters and what they're going through. Both of these movies resonate with me as few films have.I watched ""The Sixth Sense"" with the intent of not trying to figure anything out and just letting it take me where it wanted me to go. What a payoff I got.I realize that M. Night's style isn't for everyone, but to me, his approach to filmmaking is a welcome throwback to a time before we had pull-out-all-the-stops blockbuster movies bursting at the seams with CGI and other high-tech special effects. He shows us ""ordinary"" people in extraordinary situations and we get to see how they react -- while at the same time, we are kept off-balance by things we *don't* see.""The Sixth Sense"" moves slowly and deliberately. Some folks might find the pace plodding or boring, but I don't. In fact, the relatively low-key atmosphere of the film makes the story seem more real to me.Haley Joel Osment is an amazing actor. His abilities go way beyond his young years, making ""The Sixth Sense"" much more than a ""cute little kid in peril"" story. Bruce Willis' performance is skillfully nuanced and understated -- a far cry from his ""Die Hard"" days (although I like him in those kinds of movies, too). The supporting cast, including a virtually unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg, is top-notch.The DVD includes some great extras. There are four deleted scenes, a conversation with M. Night, an interesting piece called ""Rules and Clues"" about the conventions followed throughout the movie and the subtle hints about what's really going on, as well as other goodies.I hope M. Night keeps doing what he's doing for a long time to come. I think he's an incredibly talented filmmaker, and I think ""The Sixth Sense"" is a first-rate movie. This is a DVD that I know I'll be watching again and again."	5.0	Incredible	2004-08-26	1	1	0

Night Shyamalan.Cast:  Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, Haley Joel Osment, Glenn Fitzgerald.Running Time:  108 minutes.Rated PG-13 for ghastly scenes, violence, and mild language.&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is M. Night Shyamalan's first major studio directorial production, yet a rookie mistake is not present in this masterful ghost thriller that has become one of the most prestigous and talked-about horror-dramas of all time.  The film begins with an up-and-coming child psychologist (Bruce Willis, in his most exceptional role to date) celebrating his new-found success with his wife (played by Olivia Williams).  The night is going splendidly; however, a failed child of the psychologist takes his frustration out, shooting him before taking his own life.A year transpires after this horrific event, with Willis's character still trying to piece back the puzzle that was lost on that night.  The psychologist meets a troubled youngster played by the Oscar-nominated Osment, who happens to have a special sense that allows him to see and speak to ghosts.  At first terrifyed of the ghouls, Willis instructs the child to help the &quot;dead people&quot; instead of being afraid.The film is brilliantly directed and scripted, twisting and turning until the much-heralded resolution.  While Willis and Osment's performances are hauntingly special, Toni Collette's role as the tormented mother of Osment is the shining star of the film, delivering a powerful performance.  &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is a deep, terrifying look into the world of the supernatural, but unfolds into a film about faith, love, and unbridled second chances.  A soulful masterpiece that will send chills up spines.	5.0	The Sixth Sense (1999)	2004-05-22	0	0	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A268WAQS5WNMGJ	Thomas B. Gross	Those who have not already seen the movie should beware that the bonus material provided on the DVD divulges many of the plot twists that supposedly contribute to the entertainment value of the movie on first  viewing.  I regret that I happened to check out some of the bonus material  before watching the movie - I stopped immediately when I realized that they  were explaining how they did some of the scary parts (I am being  deliberately vague to avoid doing to others what the DVD bonus material did  to me) but it was too late, and I know that my experience of the film  suffered for it.I also agree with those that complain about the forced  previews at the beginning of the DVD.  This is not a very good DVD  production in terms of add-on material. Anyone who loves the film (and I  can understand how they might)probably won't care about the forced  previews, or the fact that there is no simultaneous director's commentary,  and will probably buy the DVD anyway.Incidentally, the  &quot;extended&quot; ending is pretty lame and is not reason enough to buy  the DVD.	3.0	bonus material should be viewed AFTER the movie	2000-04-02	5	2	3

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A17QHPZBYIK647	Tim Gage	To put it simply, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences missed the true best picture of 1999.  Once again they let the genre of the  picture rule what they veiwed as a movie &quot;good enough&quot; to win  their honors.  It's happened before.  &quot;Star Wars (Episode 4)&quot; and  &quot;The Exorcist&quot; were both dissed in the same way.  As bad as those  decisions were, the failure to recognize &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is far  worse.  This is possibly the best written, acted, and produced movie to  come out in 20 years.  Because it was a &quot;horror&quot; movie it was  deemed not worthy of the Academy's honors...More's the pity.	5.0	There are &quot;Best Pictures&quot; and then there is the truth...	2000-04-10	1	1	0

The  Sixth Sense would already have been a good film had it not brought the  twist in the end to high art form and raised astounding questions about  what you saw and what you didn't. Having gone through this process, a  second viewing could never recapture the immediacy or the emotions raised  at the end of the first.So what is there left to do ? My second viewing  will be about enjoying the way in which I was so beautifully led astray,  perhaps seeing if there were clues I should have spotted. This is a film I  will put away and show again to some unsuspecting guest.	4.0	The Sixth Sense	2000-03-14	0	0	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2YSOM1A805PQP	Todd Gray	The Sixth Sense turns out to be one of the highest grossing films of 1999. But why? The film offers a &quot;twist&quot; ending that is supposed to be a surprise, but if you have any common sense, you will see it coming. The ending dumbfounded millions of Americans who were so tricked that they spent their hard earned money to see this film twice. The fact that they saw it twice does not mean that it was a great film, or that is was so complicated that it would take repeated viewings to get, it meant that this film was too intelligent for the audience. Who was the audience that this film was too educated for? this film only tries to trick people at the very end by taking something that is painfully obvious and trying to say that it is the big twist. Well, M. Night, i say you stop trying to trick the uneducated audiences that were fooled by this horrible film and work on a film that is intelligent and has a strong enough plot that it does not need to rely on its ending to try to save the rest of the film.	1.0	No Surprises Here	2000-12-28	22	6	16

But &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; stays flat-footed and mostly grounded because it doens't have atmosphere.  Your  never all too scared for the young boy or his dealing with his problem.  It  is an internal struggle that doesn't surface for the viewer.  We can't  relate and do to lack of character developement we don't want to.  It has  it's strong points however, M.

A reluctant channel, Cole is frightened by visitations from those with unresolved problems who appear from the shadows. Confused by his paranormal powers, Cole is too young to understand his purpose and too afraid to tell anyone aout his anguish, except child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe. As Dr. Crowe tries to uncover the ominous truth about Cole's supernatural abilities, the consequences for client and therapist are a jolt that awakens them both to something harrowing--and unexplainable.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A243HY69GIAHFI	tropic_of_criticism	I won't comment here about the film itself, since so much of its enjoyment is derived by its ending.  Instead, I think it's instructive to note that the DVD version was released well in advance of the VHS copy.  This is no  accident.  The DVD version gives the film's production crew a chance to  fully explain all the thought they put into making this remarkable work.  There are arguably more extra features on the DVD than on anything  currently released.To be sure, not all of them are welcome.  It's been  remarked elsewhere, and I fully agree, that the compulsory trailers at the  beginning (out of which you apparently can't escape) are a complete abuse  of the lock-out feature.  It is hoped that this will not become a trend  amongst DVD manufacturers.  Also, I found the storyboard-to-shot  comparison a bit spare.  Only one rather minor scene is  compared.Everything else about the DVD, by contrast, is a movie buff's  dream.  The film is dissected thoroughly, taking the viewer through an  exploration of how each element contributes to the director's overall  vision.  Everything from color schemes to soundtrack creation is discussed.  Deleted scenes are also given director's commentary, which nascent  filmmaker's will undoubtedly find valuable.  To top it off, there's an  excellent running commentary of the film as well.In other words, ignore  the VHS version:  this Collector's Edition DVD is definitely what you want  to have in your collection.	5.0	This is a must-have DVD	2000-06-10	7	4	3

Haley Joel Osment is astounding as the child (named Cole) who &quot;sees  dead people.&quot;  He is more convincing than most characters in films  this year.  Toni Collette also does an above average job as Cole's mother,  acting as anyone would in the situation she was in.  Willis too did an  amazing job playing the pyschiatrist who attempts to help cole through the  problem.Shyalaman does an amazing job creating twists and turns in his  screenplay, thousands of tiny details that you never notice until after the  movie is over.  The ending is so smart and tricky that it gave me chills.  Shyalaman directs his actors and actresses so well that sometimes we forget  that this is only a film; the characters seem real.A must see for  anyone, a must have for most.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AU1OTANVBW9GM	Tyson Babbel	I watched this movie with a couple of friends last summer.  I remembered the movie, but I hadn't watched it since the year 2000.  Although, I did go through a couple of scenes.  It had been awhile since I had seen it, since I mostly remembered the movie as being depressing.  Sometimes, depressing movies can make you feel more bad for the characters rather than entertained.  I remembered it being depressing because it's about a boy named Cole who doesn't lives alone with his mother and doesn't really have friends.  He is also meeting with a psychologist and he has problems that can't seem to go away even with the help of the psychologist.So, while I remember it as depressing and decided to watch it with my friends I ended up really enjoying the movie more than I thought I would, and it's not quite as depressing as I remember, even if it can be a little depressing.  There are a couple of scenes with Cole smiling making the movie less depressing, and where things seem to go well.  It also has a great plot of seeing dead people that aren't even aware they're dead and have unfinished business.I also seriously can not believe how long ago this film came out.  Man, time really does fly.  It had even been a long time since I had seen it, and this film is sure to entertain you as much now as it would 15 years ago.  It's a great film you might want to see if friends are over looking for a spooky yet thriller kind of movie.I give it a 4/5 as yeah I like it, but this probably isn't a film I'd want to watch over and over again.  Not one of my favorite movies, but at least entertaining.	4.0	Watched It After 13 Years.	2014-04-19	0	0	0
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3APAEJ91IF7QQ	Unabridged	"Is it the ability to see dead people?  Yes, in a sense.  But in a broader sense, it is the ability to see the invisible, non-sensory forces that motivate people's behaviors.  In the movie, the sense is manifested in a child's ability to see ""ghosts,"" the ability to see undead people whose souls are not at rest, still troubled by what they perceive are mistakes in their past.  Many children and adults are gifted with the ability to ""see"" what other people cannot see, the ability to see what is read between the lines of the 5 normal senses.The 6th sense is a sensory skill that can be improved through effort and education.  It is often learned best by watching socially intelligent women who have suffered greatly and have decided to try to find ways to understand and care for those hurting around them.  The 6th sense is empathy.If a tree falls in the woods, and no one is around, it is still heard by empathetic people.  For those of us who understand the grief of losing someone, the pains do not diminish after they pass away prematurely.  Time passing does not ease the pain.  Intoxicants do not kill the pain.  We never stop remembering their light, their humor, their hopes, and our loss of connection.  Like ghosts, in the best sense of the term, we see them regularly revisit us.  This is a great film for these, and many more universal reasons."	5.0	What is the 6th Sense?	2006-10-29	5	2	3

The movie is engrossing from the first and successfully carries one to the ending.  It is an  ususual mix of horror and tear-jerking.  I bought the DVD on purpose  because I like the DVD format with its Menu showing up first.  Then I can  fuss with settings etc if I like; watch the extras; and choose when to  start the movie.  I returned the DVD for exchange because I was certain it  was defective.  The second DVD behaved identically.  It's almost as though  the VHS version was dumped to DVD.  The Menu was not able to be shown  first.  First one went through the FBI warnings, then we were forced to  watch Previews, and then the movie started.  Only once the movie began, was  it possible to select Menu.  The DVD suddenly went blank at the end of  Chapter 10.  This happens each and every time.  One must forceably kick in  Chapter 11.  I returned the DVD and got a second brand new DVD.  It behaved  the same way.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A1WWDFQ8HSKT0	Vincent M. Mastronardi	The only reason to perhaps even buy a DVD player now is to see this thrilling drama staring Bruce Willis.  Yes, it does seem unlikely that Bruce Willis would be in this heart warming yet eerie feature whose true  brilliance is the story telling and acting.  Bruce along with his movie  wife Olivia Williams (who shines better in &quot;Rushmnore&quot;) give  great performances but it is little Haley Joel Osmet that steals the show  as the boy with a gift for seeing things others don't.  He is picked on at  school and even is adoring mother (played by Australian Toni Collette) is  even scared of the dead people her boys sees.  The only one that goes along  with his stories is Bruce, who plays Dr. Crowe.  Together they unravel the  secrets and even become friends.I don't want to give anything away in  case you haven't seen it. I'll just say that the story and the acting will  shock you in its high quality.  This is an excellent picture.  As I said  walking out of the theater, &quot;I will never rag on Bruce Willis  again!&quot;  Of course, I didn't see his latest movie, so that helps.

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	Serling couldn't have done a better job himself. All The Sixth Sense is missing is his wry introduction. Full of unexpected twists and turns it's very clear that the director was inspired by Serling and the Twilight Zone. Although most of the scenes are well scripted and structured, there is an amateurish quality to some of the interactions between Willis and the kid. That isn't a criticism. That amateurish quality manages to stifle any &quot;pretense&quot;. This is a good old fashion thriller with a number of memorable scenes.Willis gives a subdued performance (which he duplicates in Unbreakable a riskier film that doesn't quite pay off as well as 6th Sense does), and Haley Joel Oswald gives a heartfelt performance. The O'Henry twists are pretty well hidden (although I thought it was pretty obivious by the last third what was going on).6th Sense along is a great popcorn movie (or &quot;icebox&quot; movie as some of the studio heads used to call these type of films in the 40's). Will  you watch it more than once or twice? More than likely if you enjoy good acting and Hitchcockian thrillers.	4.0	A 2 Hour Twilight Zone episode	2001-09-08	3	1	2

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A2A0FBLKJN4ZY5	W. freeman	I remember the first time i ever saw this moive, before M Knight became the (legend) he is. I remember being shocked as crap when the ending came, and thought wow this movie is going to go down as a classic. Since then since 1998 it has started a Psychological Horror revolution. Now we've had movies like The Others, The Ring, The Grudge, The Uninvited, The Messenger, Omen 666 and so on and so forth. The scary child movies have taken over and people really love it, or hate it. I for one am a huge fan of these types of movies and would take them over hack and slash films any day.Bruce Willis is very good, and i guess he must have made an impression on Mr. M, when he casted him in his other film Unbreakable directly afterwards. The i see dead people theme has been copied in film after film with pretty good success, but few have had the impact The Sixth Sense had. I'm not sure what happened to Haley Joel Osmand but he was a fine little actor. I wish he would star in more films such as this. This is arguably Shamylans best film and he has made nothing like it since, and i doubt he will. Probably another film closest to the level of this one is The Others which was very similar, but different as well. This movie is slow paced, yet effective in frights and giving you the willies over all. I remember hearing that this was an extremely low budget film and it didnt cost much of anything to make. Matter a fact the behind the scenes were very funny and show cased Shamylans artistic directing work when he was young, which was less than impressive, yet fun to behold. When the dead people were around i thought it was very original having the temperature drop and seeing the cold breath come from young coles mouth. Another great performance should go to Tony Collette who was great in this and continues to be great in all of her recent films.So yes this was a revolutionary movie without really even meaning to be, but it changed a whole generation of Psychological horror, and is definitely a classic. Even if u know the ending which about 90% of the population do, its still a great watch, even more than once. Unfortunately you can't say that about many horror films. So keep this in your collection, it's well worth it. Here are how i rate some of my other favorite movies in this same genre that i highly recommend.The Ring-10/10The Grudge-10/10The Others-10/10The Uninvited-8/10The Messengers-7/10Omen 666-8/10Case 39-7/10The Invisible-7/10The Ring 2 and Grudge 2 were good but nothing special.There are many others i can't think of right at the moment, but keep yourself scared with some of these, and start with The Sixth Sense.	5.0	The Start of a Revolution	2010-10-22	2	0	2

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	ARFCORBCTKX1J	"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer"""	"For those who haven't seen this film, don't worry. This review has no plot spoilers.There's an old saw that everyone has one big novel or story in them. Unfortunately for M Night Shyamalan, ""The Sixth Sense"" was it. Its tremendous success encouraged him to make similar films, which have been increasingly dumb and dumber. ""The Last Airbender"" is about to be released, and unless it's an unusually good film, it will be renamed with the obvious vulgarity and quickly go to video.But ""The Sixth Sense"" is a classic. Bruce Willis is a child psychologist trying to help Haley Joel Osment, a disturbed pre-teen who ""sees dead people"". Willis thinks Osment might be schizophrenic, and is about to give up the case, when he discovers that the child /might/ be telling the truth, and finds a way to help the boy come to grips with the situation, regardless of whether he's sane or psychotic. In a following scene between Osment and his mother (Toni Collette), we learn whether he really does ""see dead people"". And then comes The Big Reveal... *Forget that ""The Sixth Sense"" is a psychological thriller. It's worth seeing for Shyamalan's subtle direction and Willis's and Osment's beautiful performances. The latter is one of the great child performances in movie history.I am bothered by a recent reviewer who says that he didn't find this film ""entertaining"". It appears we have reached a point anyone born after ""Star Wars"" cannot appreciate dramas. That's pathetic and disturbing. If nothing else, ""The Sixth Sense"" is entertaining in the literal meaning of the word -- it holds our attention from start to finish.The transfer is typical Disney -- richly colored, with extreme detail and sharpness. It's close to demo quality.* Despite Syamalan's claim that he doesn't ""cheat"", there's at least one poorly structured (and retroactively implausible) scene that keeps the audience from seeing what's actually going on."	5.0	blindsided...	2010-02-28	9	7	2

Stir Of Echoes was a much better film, because it did not rely on a 'surprise' ending in order to have any impact.  All this movie is is a setup for the end, which I only thought was a surprise because it made no sense at all.  Can someone explain to me how this guy went around living his life for A YEAR being invisible to everyone and didnt realize something was up?  Supposedly thats what happened, because he had been dead and living as a ghost for a year when the meets the kid.  This plot hole completely ruined the movie for me, and I don't even see how it was made with such a glaring mistake regarding its main attraction (the surprise ending) .

Achrya	"- Whaddaya think I am: stoopid???Bruce Willis' line as John McClane in ""Die Hard"" echoes the question I'd like to ask Mr Shyamalan concerning his highly overrated ""The Sixth Sense"".In his effort to cross all the ""t""s and dot all the ""i""s, telling the viewer exactly what to think about the existence of ghosts, and leaving no room whatsoever for doubt, Shyamalan generates a script whose middle name is ""Plot-Hole"".The basic premise is that ghosts, being disembodied and from the Beyond, labor under certain limitations: they can't enter churches, manipulate solid objects etc etc. They have unfinished business among the living, for which they need the help of a specially-gifted human, the eight-year-old Cole Sear, who in turn is able occasionally to find sanctuary from them.Enter Mr Superghost. He looks perfectly at ease in a church, is able to change clothes, open doors and throw rocks... Why him and not the rest? We don't know. But, just like other ghosts, he ""doesn't know that he is dead"" -  i.e. he doesn't notice that he all of a sudden doesn't eat, can't get service in a store or buy a bus ticket, and doesn't need to go to the bathroom. Huh???Personally, the idea that Crowe was dead occurred to me early on, but I dismissed it with a  ""Nah, it can't be _that_ dumb!""And yet the cinematography, the acting, the well-crafted overall mood would suffice to compensate for the hole-ridden plot and the offensively obvious ""symbols"" (Yes, the color RED has a special significance, yes, clever girl has been paying good attention to Teacher Shyamalan and figured it all out!) if we were granted a sceptic's escape hatch, the benefit of a doubt, the right to assume an alternative interpretation where Crowe is simply a burned-out psychologist who helps Cole to deal with the bogeymen in his mind. Letting Crowe walk down the school stairs after Cole's theatre performance and ending the film there would have saved the day.But ambiguity is a Bad Thing to the good Mr Shyamalan. He has to spell it all out while drowning the entire dish in sentimental syrup.The extatic reception that ""The Sixth Sense"" has received says something about the sad current state of the entertainment industry. In all, the film is a bad waste of good talent."	2.0	"""Whaddaya think I am: stoopid???"""	2002-02-01	11	5	6
630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A3GJT5AACJ35YN	W. Marshall	M. Knight Shyamalan was put on the map with this film, as well as Haley Joel Osment.  One of the highest grossing films of 1999, the Sixth Sense became an instant classic garnering repeat viewings from thousands of fans just to see what they missed. I'm not sure if the pace of the film is deliberately slow, but by the time you witness the last 15 minutes - because of the pace of the film - the ending seems to have a much bigger impact than if the movie was fast-paced and full of scares.  But Bruce Willis does prove that he can be artsy and not only &quot;John McClane-style&quot;, but the real performance was by Osment.  He seems to portray the subtle innocence with such ease.

If you saw this movie once, I am pretty  sure that you will not like this movie as much as you did in the theater.  The movie is very slow, especially for the first 30 minutes.  The ending is  not that surprising, either.  I heard that many people saw the movie again  and again just because they couldn't believe what they saw at the end.  Frankly, I wouldn't do that.  For those whoe want to buy this movie, rent  the movie first and see it.  If you still like it, then get it.  If I were  you, I will wait until the price drops a little more.There is no  question about the acting, though.  A little kid in the movie was pretty  good (deserved to be nominated).

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	A38BC2TD8J618M	"""wowous_darcen"""	"That's what you'll be saying when you finish watching ""The Sixth Sense"".However, when you watch it again, you'll say that alot more often.M. Night Shyamalan, director-writer of ""The Sixth Sense"" (later Unbreakable, Signs) is a genius. Night (as he likes to be called), set up this movie as a thriller in what seemed to be the wake of Blair Witch, which is why I personally didn't go see it in theatres. I'm not a big horror fan. Later when I saw it on TV it absolutly blew me away.The movie really isn't a horror movie. It's much more of a deep, thoughtful psychological thriller. And I love deep movies. The movies opening ten minutes are a rush, and then the next half hour moves quite slowly. I got extremely bored watching this section the first time, but trust me, its all worth it. As the story progresses the last hour is excellent.And the final five minutes... Check the bold print above.This movie is 2 movies in one. It's one movie your first viewing, and a second the second time you see it. It's a movie you invite everyone who hasn't seen it over to see their expressions when it ends. And its a fine, fine DVD.DVD:The video quality on this DVD is pretty much flawless. Once and a while a single frame will have a white spec on it. The sound is also beautiful for non-surround sound + surround sound alike.The movie is slightly widescreened on a normal TV, but not to the extent of ""Pearl Harbor"".The Case: The case is unique to say the least. It's got an outer cover, that you pull out the case from. This case opens up into about 6 pages, with the 2 DVDs in the middle, and to the far right some drawings of the storyboards and a booklet explaining the special features + chapters.The Trailers: There are 3 trailers included. 2 TV Spots, The 15 second one shows the 5 senses and the 6th sense as the kid. The 30 second one is a bunch of short clips of the infamous scenes from the movie. The Theatrical trailer is the best of the bunch, it makes out the movie to be a horror movie, and made famous the ""I see dead people"" line.Reflections From The Set: One of the largest segments, about 40 minutes long. Well done interviewing Producers, Directors, and Actor/Actresses. I was amazed to see that the two female leads (Crowe's Wife + Cole's Mother) both had English and Australian accents respectively. I couldn't tell the least bit in the movie. This like most of the other features gives away the ending. I loved the Bruce Willis + (Vincent Gray Actor?) segments telling how they prepared for their roles.Paranormal Special: I was expecting a ""Sightings""-esque feature, but it turned out to be much deeper including interviews with Night, the writer of ""The Exorsist"" and my favorite interviewee The writer of ""Ghost"". It was very intresting to hear how the writer of ""Ghost"" developed the idea for his movie, and why he chose to write from the side of the ghost (Patrick Swayze).Storyboarding: This segment shows how Night, unlike other writer/directors chose to draw out the entire movie on storyboards before actually taping it, saving him perhaps millions of dollars, but adding 12 - 16 weeks of writing time. It was intresting to see after the movie.Music/Sound: This segment was actually one of the most intresting on the disk. I was surprised how many human ""voices"" they had put in the movie backround. Several of the scenes they took upcoming dialouge and played it backwords slightly before the actor said it. The more I listened to this, the creeper the movie actually got, while at the same time it increased the effort I saw being put in. It also explains why some scenes (namely the Cole tells Mom scene) don't have any music in the backround.Hints/Clues/Rules: If you've seen the movie, you should know what this is talking about. If you haven't, watch the movie at least twice before viewing this excellent segment.Reaching The Audience: This segment has the five or six producers + Night talking about how unexpected the 2 week #1 spot run + subsequent #10 grossing of all time was. It was hillarious to hear that the studio thought the movie would be a flop when no one clapped at the end of the inital screening (apparently, they were all still in shock with their jaws on the floor).Deleted Scenes: all of these scenes were magnificantly done. Each is introduced by Night, explaining the scene, where in the movie it was located, and why it was taken out. Most were to stop the ruining of the ending, or stop confusion to the audience. I agree with Night's assesment of cutting the ""Extended"" ending to its current version, so it ends as a shocker and not a sobber.Complaints:1) No Director's Commentary2) My 2 fav trailers before seeing this movie were the Pearl Harbor Trailers. This movie contains one that is superior to the 2 on the Pearl Harbor DVD, and yet once you view it at the beginning of the disk, there is no way to review it.

The  mother is a divorced, overwhelmed person who is entirely believable.  I  liked how his last name, Sear, resembles Seer.A minor flaw was that I  would have liked to known more about the dead person with the scars all  over her...and the scars on Cole. I liked that the dead people really  wanted help, and I wanted to know about the dead person during the  audition.  The actors who played the dead people were plain freaky, as the  low-budget barely-any-special-effects, REAL places in a REAL world  is.THis is one of the better films of 1999, and one of the most  intelligent thriller/horror movies out there, avoiding the cheesy horror  cliche's (the hand touching the shoulder, the camera manipulation, the  15-minute-long violin screech, etc.) and the amazing amount of stupid gore  slasher-movies.	4.0	The Hype Made Me Eat At The Ending	2000-08-13	1	1	0

630573240X	The Sixth Sense [VHS]	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"Is there such a thing as a ""perfect movie""?  If that concept does indeed exist, than ""The Sixth Sense"" comes about as close as possibly to taking that prize.  It contains everything one could ask for in a film.For a basic plot summary, ""The Sixth Sense"" tells the story of young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who is prone to visions of dead ghosts and as such is not fitting in very well at school or at home.  With the help of a very unique child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), however, Cole is finally able to face his fears and begin to move on with his life.Since it is easier to come at this review from this angle, about the only people who WON'T enjoy this movie are those who only like the mindless actions of explosions, car chases, and flexing muscles.  Not to disparage those films or their audiences, but if that is the only kind of fare that gets you revved up in the theater, then this one might not be for you.For everyone else, though, ""Sixth Sense"" is almost a clinic in how to make a movie that will keep the audience engaging in nearly every way possible.  It is the kind of film that one cannot say too much about or risk major spoilers, but suffice it to say that it is filled with mystery, layer upon layer of plots, terrific acting, suspense, and a jaw-dropping finale that will have you rebooting the whole experience again very soon!  Though perhaps not by a humongous margin (as ""Signs"" is excellent in its own right), ""Sixth Sense"" is the hallmark film from director M. Night Shyamalan, as it is the perfect showcase for the type of movies he enjoyed making.Overall, this film is easily in my Top Ten Films of All-Time mental list, and perhaps even encroaching on the Top Five.  It is an absolute masterpiece in every sense of the word.  If for some reason you haven't seen it, it may just fundamentally change the way you view cinema forever."	5.0	The Way Cinema Is Supposed To Work	2013-04-21	1	1	0

Haley Joel Osment gives a great peformance as Cole Sear, a young boy who can see ghosts. He is better than most adult actors, despite his age, and delivers a phenomenal performance in this movie. Bruce Willis, though not at his strongest, was also good. One thing that really caught the eye was the screenplay: It was imaginative and eventful, and had many interesting twists to it. M. Night Shyamalan really pulls something off with this movie, and, though it was worthy of it's Best Picture nomination, was not something which, I repeat, lived up to the hype given it.	5.0	The Sixth Sense (1999)	2004-10-08	8	3	5

Mann	It was a pretty long time ago, but this is still the movie that keeps me up at night, right after the movie ended and I'd walked out of the theater, I'd decided I was a true fan of M. Night Shyamalan.Bruce Willis stars as a child psychiatrist who perplexed by his recent patiets odd habits and claim of seeing the dead, while at the same time he's fighting his own problems at home.Though the followup(&quot;UNBREAKABLE&quot;) wasn't all that great, &quot;SIGNS&quot; came roaring back with yet another, A list thriller.	5.0	SHOCKING!	2002-08-08	1	0	1
