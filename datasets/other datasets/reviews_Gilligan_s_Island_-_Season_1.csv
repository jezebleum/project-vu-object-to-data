B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	"Of course it is derivative: Skipper and Gilligan are just whiskers short of ""Laurel and Hardy"". Then, you have the reincarnation of Marilyn Monroe (Ginger), an all-grown-up Dorothy from the 'Wizard of Oz,' (Mary Ann, who can't wait to go home to Kansas), and two caricatures of wealth (the Howells) and science (the Professor). Despite all this, 'Gilligan's Island' is very entertaining and a rare TV satire. Yes, I said, satire. The latter elements, however, came from the visitors, including a Soviet cosmonaut (The Cold War and the Space Race), The Mosquitoes (Beatlemania), the off-course surfer dude (The California scene with its surfing and bodybuilding) to name just a few. I must say that this no-brainer series has me envying that we did not have these DVD's when I was in college, (a wonderful antidote to the mental exhaustion of exams). Having said that, I find as an adult, 'Gilligan's Island' B-level gold, something I value even more than I did during my youth when the series was just a lot of fun to watch."	3.0	No Apologies Necessary:  'Gilligan's Island' Is Fun	2013-10-11	1	1	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A257UC0ST4FFAY	"80sLady ""PRG"""	"After I had acquired the last season of ""Gilligan's Island"", I sat down for three days and watched everything Gilligan.Spoken like a true underdog, I sympathized with Gilligan's antics.  Although sweet and well-meaning, Gilligan can't seem to get his act together, especially when it comes to being rescued.  Whether he's just botched up one of the Professor's experiments or frightened one of the potential rescuers away, it's a wonder after all of this and the Skipper's brow-beating why Gilligan hadn't resigned himself to the other side of the island.  Ever optimistic, Gilligan is like the happy boy at Christmastime whose spirit cannot break easily.Gilliagn's faithful confidante is his old buddy, the Skipper, who is like a father, and is a mentor and a friend to him.  There is nothing that Gilligan wouldn't do for his Skipper.  Picture the eccentric million/billionaires, Thurston and Lovey Howell, as the King and Queen of England, scoffing at the thought of doing menial labor yet reluctantly pitching in to lend a helping hand and provide comic relief.  Ever wonder what a famous actress would end up like in a deserted island?  Apparently, like one of the bunch.  In the first season, Ginger dresses more shabbier than Mary Ann, than gradually begins to acquire a bigger and better wardrobe.  How DID the girls manage to find all of the materials to make all of their clothes?  Weren't the members all going on a three hour tour?  In any case, no one can deny the chemistry between Ginger and the Profesor or the never-to-be budding romance between Mary Ann and Gilligan.  Speaking of the Professor, he was so knowledgeable as to figure out how to stop a volcano from erupting and how to make a florescent dye out of materials found on the island, yet he was never effectively able to conjure up an experiment or product to get them off of the island.  As the series progresses, it appeared that it was the Professor's intentions to actually stay on the island.  What a blow that discovery would have been for the rest of the Minnow passengers and crew.Although only a three hour tour, this series went on for three years (another twelve years were off-camera). And for fifteen years, these characters learned to laugh, love and live with each other like a real family.  Kooky characters and all."	4.0	Stranded on Gilligan Land... and Loving It	2007-10-03	2	2	0

The first season has some great and classic episodes incluing: Big Gun Little Island, A Nose by Any Other Name, Angel on the Island, Diamonds are an Ape's Best Friend, and Birds Gotta Fly Fish Gotta Talk. Bob Denver was a true talent, his physical comedy and facial expressions still warm my heart to this day.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A7J9DTDAPG3RE	Alan Vallazza	"The Cast--------Backus, Jim  Thurston Howell IIIDenver, Bob  Gilligan (some say Willy Gilligan)Hale Jr., Alan  Skipper Jonas GrumbyJohnson, Russell  Professor Roy HinkleyLouise, Tina  Ginger GrantSchafer, Natalie  Lovey Wentworth HowellWells, Dawn  Mary Ann SummersMaxwell, Charles  radio announcerA ship's captain, his first mate, an actress, a professor, a farm girl, a millionaire and his wife, all stranded on an uncharted desert island in the South Pacific. Seven random people thrown together by fate, united in search of an exit. A Twilight Zone episode, you say? An existential play by Jean Paul Sartre, perhaps? No, nothing quite so cerebral. It's the central plot line of Gilligan's Island, one of the most popular and most referenced sitcoms in television history.In September of 1964 the S.S. Minnow set sail on a three-hour tour that would last three years in prime time. Although Gilligan's Island, the brainchild of Brady Bunch creator Sherwood Schwartz, was one of the worst reviewed shows ever broadcast, it was always a favorite with the viewing public. Millions of people tuned in to see the comic antics of the inept Gilligan and watch each week as the castaways inevitably failed to get off the island.Gilligan was the boat's sole crew member, aside from the skipper. He was well-meaning but inept in his attempts to find a means of returning to civilization. As a result, and perhaps even more because this simple-minded farce became a top hit, the little band was stranded on that island for three full seasons. One question that never got answered, however, concerned the luggage. In the first episode, and in the theme song, it was pointed out that the cruise was only supposed to be for three hours. How, then, did the passengers have enough clothing to last three years?Gilligan's biggest fans were kids, and when the series finally went into repeats on local stations and on cable TV such as Nick at Nite they made it one of the biggest rerun hits of all time. Even though the reruns were colorized, for a while, whereas they were all black and white when originally aired in the 60s. By the way, The Hallmark Channel now shows them in black and white as opposed to when they were on TNT. Anyways, an animated cartoon version called The New Adventures of Gilligan was produced for ABC, and ran on that network's weekend daytime schedule from 1974 to 1977.Then in 1978 NBC had the bright idea of bringing the original cast back together for a reunion special, in which they were finally rescued. All agreed to appear except Tina Louise (who wanted too much money, and so was replaced by Judith Baldwin). ""Rescue From Gilligan's Island"" aired in October 1978 as a two-part special, and was a phenomenal hit. They did finally get off the island, and returned to a triumphant homecoming. But then they made the mistake of going on a reunion cruise on the Minnow II, only to wind up stranded back on the same island--the result of another freak storm! ""Castaways on Gilligan's Island,"" a folow-up special aired in 1979, had them converting the island into a tourist resort. And in still another sequel in 1981, The Harlem Globetrotters dropped in! There was a talk of reviving the series, but audiences for the 1979 and 1981 sequels were not very large, and the plans never materialized.One of TV's great bits of trivia is Gilligan's first name. None was ever revealed on the show, but years later on a talk show Bob Denver claimed that he had talked the matter over with the show's creator/producer Sherwood Schwartz, and they had decided that if Gilligan ever did need a first name it would be ""Willie.""Also did you know that Jayne Mansfield turned down the role of ""Ginger""; Carroll O'Connor tested for the role of The Skipper; Raquel Welch auditioned for the role of Mary Anne; Dabney Coleman tested for the role of The Professor and Jerry Van Dyke, Dick's Brother, turned down the role of Gilligan.Bob Denver had a character on The Many Lives of Dobie Gillis playing Maynard G. Krebs.Jim Backus,aka Thurston Howell III, appeared the year before Gilligan's debut in the 1963 movie It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World as the pilot of a plane which had Mickey Rooney and Buddy Hackett on board.Natalie Schafer also was on the short lived drama series The Survivors with Lana Turner, Ralph Bellamy, Jan Micheal-Vincent, and George Hamilton in 1969-70.The original pilot was filmed in November of 1963 but never aired until October of 1992 on TBS. In the original pilot, the characters of the Professor and Ginger were played by a different actor and actress. There was no character of Mary Ann. In the pilot, there was a character called Bunny. Bunny was the buxom blonde and Ginger was a practical brunette. In the pilot, Ginger and Bunny were both secretaries. The music for the original pilot's theme song was written by (a young) John Williams. This music had a Latin sound and the lyrics were sung with a Spanish accent. In the pilot, it was a six-hour trip, not a three-hour tour.The three man folk singing group, The Wellingtons, sang the theme song for the first season, but were replaced by a similar sounding group, The Eligibles, for the following seasons. However, The Wellingtons (plus one) also portrayed 'The Mosquitoes' in a classic episode of the series.Originally slated to return for the 1967-68 television season it was instead canceled at the last minute by CBS head William Paley, to make room for Gunsmoke.The Music---------Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale,a tale of a fateful trip.That started from this tropic port,aboard this tiny ship.The mate was a mighty sailin' man,the skipper brave and sure.Five passengers set sail that day,for a three hour tour, a three hour tour.The weather started getting rough,the tiny ship was tossed.If not for the courage of the fearless crew,the Minnow would be lost; the Minnow would be lost.The ship set ground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle,with Gilligan, the Skipper too,the Millionaire, and his Wife,the Movie Star, and the rest,(the Movie Star, the Professor and Mary Ann,)here on Gilligan's Isle.So this is the tale of our castaways,they're here for a long long time.They'll have to make the best of things,it's an uphill climb.The first mate and his skipper too,will do their very best,to make the others comfortable,in their tropic island nest.No phones, no lights, no motor car,not a single luxury.Like Robinson Crusoe,it's primitive as can be.So join us here each week my friend,you're sure to get a smile.From seven stranded castaways,Here on Gilligan's Isle."	5.0	The History of Gilligan's Island 1964 to 1967 on CBS.	2004-01-10	70	60	10

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A35ID1D3XTBSSV	"algebra74 ""algebra74"""	"If you are reading this review, you should be aware that this review has been written before the release date, and therefore cannot depict the ""actual product.""  It can, however, give a helpful insight.""Gilligan's Island"", an extremely popular sitcom since its first airing in 1964, has become a household name for many.  I can say with great assurance that everyone is pleased that such an innocent 60s comedy like this is finally coming to DVD in complete season sets.I can only review this set from the information I have acheived.  Let's start out with the basics.  3 DVD set:  first of all, what are 36 episodes, a pilot, and about 2 hours worth of bonus features doing on 3 DVDs?  I will tell you.  It calculates that some DVDs having as many as 13 episodes.  This means that each DVD will have over 5 hours of footage.  This is ridiculous.  We all know that the more footage on a single disc, the lower the quality.  This set better have dual-layer DVDs, or else the quality will be unbearable.  Why couldn't they have made this a 5 disc set with only 7 or 8 episodes per disc?  I will tell you why.  The producers thought that if there were only 3 discs, they could make the price lower than if it had 5 discs.  This maybe so.  If it were 5 discs, the price would be close to 60 dollars.  Does 60 dollars really matter to a 40-year fan that has waited on this set forever?  NO!  Infact, a fan would probably be dissappointed because the quality of these classic shows were sacraficed for the low price.The packaging does look neat and well put together.  The cover is rather catchy to the eye, and one can tell that this set was not thrown together in one night.  Also, the bonus features do seem satisfying.I cannot really give this DVD a fair review until it comes out, but I guarantee you that I will write a fair review the very day this long-awaited DVD comes out."	4.0	A Pre-Review	2003-11-27	29	10	19

I also have the soft cover book ""The Unofficial Gilligan's Island Handbook"" explaining each characters and actor as well as in depth description of  each show with original air dates, etc...  To say the least, I am an avid fan and have been waiting for dvd release for a long time.  I am a bit concerned though as different retail sites list specifics differently about this set.  I have read it will be made by Warner Studios in B/W and I have also read it'll be made by Turner Studios in (Turnerized) color.  Even with no extras, if shows are remastered and in B/W, it will definately be worth owning and cherished for years.  If colorized by Ted Turner and his company, it will ruin the shows just as they did when shown on Turner's tv station. I'd probably still buy it, just to have it, but it won't be cherished.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A1IKOYZVFHO1XP	andy8047	"Sherwood Schwartz who would later create and produce ""The Brady Bunch"",created and produced this awesome series about seven stranded castaways on Gilligan's Island. Here are the episodes from the first season,1964-65. Bob Denver is Gilligan,a sailor. The late Alan Hale is the Skipper,who has a love/hate friendship with Gilligan. The late Jim Backus,famous for the voice of the animated Mr. Magoo,is a wealthy man named Thurston Howell III. The late Natalie Schaefer is Lovey Howell,Thurston's wife. Tina Louise is a young,beautiful film actress named Ginger Grant. This season,in which the episodes were black and white,featured recurring characters,a professor and a young girl named Mary Ann,respectively portrayed by Russell Johnson and Dawn Wells. Those characters were not mentioned in the theme song since they were recurring. They were part of ""all the rest"". Thurston is referred to as ""the millionaire"" and Ginger is ""the movie star"". One highlight from this season is the episode or few episodes where a young Kurt Russell guest-starred. He was then 13 years old. Colorized versions of these episodes aired on cable television's TNT(Turner Network Television). To the best of my knowledge,this series is the only one in which colorized versions of black and white episodes aired."	5.0	Seven stranded castaways	2004-06-16	3	3	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A1T9PJBFBFKSGD	Auburn Niewiadomski	"This show could have easily been forgotten but now it's impossible because of the great cast this show had. Gilligan (Bob Denver) and the Skipper (Alan Hale Jr.) were terrific at slap stick comedy. And then there are the sophisticated millionaires Thurston Howell the third (Jim Backus) and his wife ""Lovey"", (Natalie Schafer) and there also is the movie star Ginger. (Tina Louise) And for some strange reason Russell Johnson (the Professor) and Dawn Wells (Mary Ann) aren't credited in the first season but they have just as big a role as any other character. So as you can see there's something for everyone in this show, and the cast all did an extraordinary job at making their characters so beloved.If you don't know the plot of this show I don't know where you've been because this has been one of the most re-run shows of all time, so even though I was born in 1995 I watched many episodes. It's a shame this show only lasted three seasons and it didn't get canceled because it wasn't popular, it was very successful but for some crazy reason it was cancelled for re-runs of Gunsmoke.  But fortunately we now have the entire first season on DVD for us to enjoy from now on. When I watch Gilligan's Island I think for some stupid reason they will get off the island even though I knew they wouldn't (oops! I spoiled the show, I'm so sorry) so it just never got tiresome watching them almost get back to society only for their hopes and dreams to be dashed by Gilligan's blunders. I also love this show for the cheesy inventions created by the Professor, like the shell phone (I don't remember which season this episode is from) and not just inventions, they always have everything they need, an endless amount of clothes, makeup, and an endless amount of guest stars.  : )I don't recall any episodes being edited and the bonus features are decent, so there is good incentive to buy this set. Also included with this set is the series pilot. The theme song is way different than the one we all grew up with but it's enjoyable to listen to for one episode. And the pilot also has a commentary with the creator of Gilligan's Island Sherwood Schwartz, he makes interesting commentaries and I would recommend listening to them. There also is a short feature about how the series was created. Oh, two other small bonus features are a Gilligan's Island survival guide and tropical tidbits. (On-screen factoids)Now I know everybody's got their own favorite episode, but I'd like to chime in and tell you mine. I love both of the episodes when Hans Conried guest stars as Wrongway Feldman. ""President Gilligan"" is another great episode. The Skipper and Mr. Howell both want to be in charge of the island, so they decide to have an election and by the title of the episode, I think you know who gets elected. There are just so many outlandish plots, so it's hard to choose which ones my favorite, and it's pretty hard to watch just one episode at a time, but those are just some of my favorite episodes. Well, now that I've discussed my favorites, I'll list the episode descriptions for season one.Two on a Raft - Airdate: 9/26/1964 - The Skipper and Gilligan sail for help on a raft, only to wind up back on the same island.Home Sweet Hut - Airdate: 10/3/1964 - The castaways build a hut for all, but tensions mount and soon they all build their own huts.Voodoo Something for Me - Airdate: 10/10/1964 - Skipper believes the island is under the spell of Voodoo and that Gilligan has been turned into a chimp.Goodnight Sweet Skipper - Airdate: 10/17/1964 - Skipper turns the radio into a transmitter.

Now Gilligan must defuse it.Gilligan Meets Jungle Boy - Airdate: 2/6/1965 - A jungle boy learns language and manners from the women and in return he shows them helium like gas which could be used to rescue the castaways off the Island.St. Gilligan and the Dragon - Airdate: 2/13/1965 - The women tire of being held subservient to the men and decide to separate and build their own camp.Big Men on a Little Stick - Airdate: 2/20/1965 - Super Surfer Duke Williams rides a tsunami onto the island.Diamonds Are an Ape's Best Friend - Airdate: 2/27/1965 - A gorilla is loose on the island, and he likes Mrs. Howell's perfume.How to Be a Hero - Airdate: 3/6/1965 - Gilligan has to be rescued while he is rescuing Mary Ann.

There is no series out there today that can compare with these episodes.  Getting the oppurtunity to watch these again in my old age has been like a welcome retreat from todays realities!  I don't know many people anymore who eminate with  the values the people who lived in the era in which this show was created did.  Thank you for the chance to step back in time and be reminded of what used to be and what all of us could have today, just one person at a time is all it takes being kind and courteous.	5.0	Awesome	2013-10-26	0	0	0
B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A3WPGO5YBL14O	Becky Driskill	It has been a treat to watch the series from it's inception. I was actually surprised to discover that the beginning episodes are funny and the subject matter is appropriate to the challenges one would face when being marooned on a deserted island. As time goes on, and the writers struggled for new ideas, it becomes noticeable. I was watching the episodes in succession so that I may finally learn the answers to the questions that still haunt me today; &#34;How did Ginger and Maryann have so many different clothing choices, as well as Mr. and Mrs. Howell? Why did the men still wear the same clothes everyday? Where did they find the clothes to sew the curtains for their stage and lastly, Why did Mr. Howell bring along all that money??&#34; Definitely, the deep thoughts that will be forever unanswered!	5.0	Revisiting my Youth!	2013-03-26	0	0	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A31OPSNAXK3UA7	"Bela ""Bela Ghostly"""	As a kid I use to run home to catch the reruns. My friends hated this show.I couldn't understand why. The comedy was so well written and acted andjust like nothing else on tv. I was too young to remember when it originallyaired so it's so great to see the uncut tv versions. I've had some of theColumbia house vhs released in the 90's but they didn't have many ofmy favorite episodes and the quality was wearing out. I just got thisat best buy and I was shocked at the asking price but I noticed theyonly had one left and dvd's are being phased out. I paid 59.00 butnow I see it was a bad deal. If I bought here paid for shipping wouldbe about the same but now I get to watch today and tonight! I'm alreadythrough 10 episodes and they are just so much funnier after all thecrap on tv today! I'm so glad I got this before it's out of print and hardto find. Now I can donate my vhs to the local charity store for thosewho can't afford the dvds! Hopefully will make them laugh like I'm doing now!I see even TV Land has it back in reruns! so much for their NEW CRAPNASTY NOT FUNNY COMEDY SHOWS!

All 36 episodes in season one were well written and acted out by the cast. Although the set doesn't have many extras, it includes the unaired pilot, pop up facts, and a small featurette, as well as interesting commentaries.

Gilligan's Island is the classic wholesome sitcom with a little adventure thrown in.  If Lost were a comedy, it might look a bit like this.  And, of course, if you watch this, you'll be able to answer the classic question:  Ginger or Maryanne?  It is a bit racist when depicting Asians and tribal people, so beware; it's definitely a product of the '60s.	4.0	When a Season Was a Season	2013-12-13	0	0	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A3MGJVPJBNPSEJ	Blahblahblah	&quot;Gold is where you find it&quot; (whatever his or her real name may be) feels that only people with low IQs enjoy Gilligan's Island.  Maybe that explains why I only scored 97.3% on my LSATS and consistently only score in the neighbourhood of 170 on intelligence tests. Maybe that's why I don't appreciate the sublime comedies of The Bard which usually center around women fooling their husbands into thinking they are male strangers simply by wearing false mustaches.  Maybe that is why I prefer watching a lighthearted comedy like Gilligan's Island which deftly satirizes such things as greed and egotism and envy, etc. over insulting other people on the internet or reading some dreary novel about existential ennui any day.For those reasons, I am personally quite thankful that Gilligan's Island is now being collected on DVD to provide entertainment to my woefully inadequate intelligence (We philistines in Canada also have an unfortunate need for fun. C'est la vie.)  Of course, I often wonder why Gilligan doesn't get shot by the other castaways halfway through each episode (something I also often wondered about the entire cast of Seinfeld), but then my brain just begins to hurt and I stop.	5.0	Fun Satire	2004-06-15	10	8	2

The prints are very clean and crisp, too.  They look nowhere near 40+ years old.Also included here is the original version of the pilot with some different actors/characters that sold the show to the network but was never aired until 1992, albeit in a shortened version.  There is commentary by creator Sherwood Schwartz on the pilot, too.It's too bad that there was no involvement by Bob Denver on any of the three season sets for ""Gilligan's Island"".  All of them were released before his passing last month, so it would have been possible.  If only we had a little commentary from him or a short interview with him reminiscing about the role that will make him live forever in our minds, but I'm afraid that it didn't happen.Rest in peace, ""Little Buddy""."	5.0	Presented In All Its Original Black & White, Uncut CBS Glory!	2005-10-23	16	14	2

In his every day sabotage of being rescued, he has shown me that he is in love with Ginger and Mary Ann, as am I, and doesn't want to be rescued. What an awesome first season for a highly syndicated show from my childhood, watching it again as an adult was a very enjoyable experience for this fan of early 60's television shows.	5.0	Gilligan's Island Resolved	2014-01-02	0	0	0
B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A17JJU5H5E8MO2	Brad Mpls	Everytime I use Amazon Prime I get technical glitches.  This time (Gilligan's) the stream kept pausing and loading, at one point, every 20 seconds or so.  This isn't the first time and I've all but given up on Amazon Prime Instant Video.  I'm particularly torqued because all the HD selections (obviously not Gilligan) claim I'm not able to receive HD on my PC.  Really?  I've never had a problem with Netflix or Hulu -- ever.  And I have broadband (cable) Internet running over 30 Mbps and an Intel core i3 processor on my PC with no other programs running when I stream video.So, I guess I'm venting here and because of the play/pause/delay in the Gilligan's Island streaming.  I've sent correspondence to Amazon about it and their reply was (paraphrased), it's all my problem and my equipment.  Again, Netflix & Hulu stream a-okay.Oh well, at least I get free 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime (although it cost me $79.00 for the year).	1.0	Love the series.

What I think most are interested in, as was I,  was the quality of the film and the storage cases.  Everything was perfect.  :)  No issues with sound or film quality or the packaging.  I was a bit concerned about the quality and functionality of the storage cases in particular, after reading so many negative reviews on a lot of the old TV series sets (I Dream of Jeannie, Charlie's Angels, etc.), but there were no issues at all with this set.  All three seasons come packaged in their own (normal) individual DVD cases with no worries of them being stacked on top of one another, getting scratched, or falling out and they all fit nicely together in the sturdy cardboard case that comes with it.  I am so happy that it was exactly as I watched on TV when I was a kid and it has now become my 10 year old son's favorite show.  He even enjoys the black and white episodes (the first season), which wouldn't have been possible with poor film or sound quality.  Definitely worth the investment.  :)	5.0	Excellent Quality & Value	2014-01-13	0	0	0
B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A1BMQA5PIZKU1P	"Bryan ""Dragonboots"""	To anyone thinking of buying the complete series, there are two versions:  the 9-disc double sided version and the 17-disc version which was made last year.  In my case I made sure I was buying the 17 disc version and what was more interesting -at the time of this review- is that is HALF the price of the inferior 9 disc version(who would want the double sided discs when you can get the single sided cheaper? duh).  The color episodes look great considering it's an almost 50 year old show and the packaging is the spindle kind where the disc are all in the middle of the case with a disc on each side of the tray.  Great show for people into nostalgia or just miss the days when they grew up watching this show on reruns in the 70s and 80s like me.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A3HDNSPMU0IAPT	Byron Hartzler	Most of the comedy itself is clean. I never noticed as a kid that almost all the episodes deal with the same theme of trying to get off the island - the theme gets boring after a while. Unfortunately, the values that are exhibited are not moral: 1.) Mr. Howell is not faithful to his wife and is greedy 2.) Ginger & Mary Ann do not dress modestly 3.) the Professor promotes atheism through the normal macro-evolution baloney 4.) witchcraft is presented on several occasions 5.) Ginger tries to get her way by being seductive and 6.) the Skipper has a horrible temper.	3.0	DVD's: Gilligan's Island - The Complete First Season	2009-07-30	32	4	28

I paid about 35 and it was worth it.  Good acting from the 60s and funny situations made this light heared comedy a must for Gilligan fans.  I gave it 4 stars and it was worth what I paid.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	ANO8T2ONSDKMX	Cassiesgram	I bought Gilligan's Island: The Complete Series Collection (1964), at a super discount price, $45.99!I didn't want to just buy my 3 grandsons more toys for Christmas, so I searched for something that would last and I hoped they would enjoy. I saw this set at target but decided to see what the price was on Amazon. Wow great savings!My daughter wasn't sure the boys would like the Gilligan series, stating it may be out of fashion, to old of comedy for todays generation.I gave it to them anyways!All I hear from them is that they think Gilligan is so funny, they love the dvd's, they try to watch an episode or 2 each evening after their homework is finished. They even told me another relative (adult) wants them to bring the dvd's over when they spend the night.You can't lose on buying this series. Be it old entertainment or not, it is no where close to being out of fashion, and the bonus, no cursing and such!

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A1B79X8PAU8IZQ	Cee Sexton	Fifty years after first hitting the airwaves and with only two of the original seven cast members (Tina Louise, who played Ginger, and Dawn Wells, who played Mary Ann) still alive, Gilligan's Island is still going strong and still building its fan base.  I'd love to see any modern show, with all their violence, gore, and profanity, still so popular after fifty years.  Gilligan's Island has none of the second two, and what passes for violence on the show is a few gunshots that never hit anybody, a few explosions that never kill anything but fish and palm trees, and a handful of fights which never take place on screen.  And of course, the Skipper smacking Gilligan with his hat, which he does whenever Gilligan screws up, which is every time Gilligan does anything, naturally.  My favorite &#34;fight&#34; is in the episode &#34;The Little Dictator&#34; from season two when a Latin American dictator takes Gilligan prisoner.  As they march behind a large bush, the sounds of a scuffle can be heard, and a cloud of dust rises, followed by the dictator marching out with his hands held high, and right behind comes Gilligan, now brandishing the dictator's pistol!  Of course, this is Gilligan we're talking about, so when the pair passes behind the next bush, the scene repeats itself, only now when they emerge, they are back to their original positions.  This show proves what today's directors and producers seem to have forgotten:  A high body count and constant swearing and sex talk are not necessary to make a movie or television show popular.Gilligan's Island also serves as yet another reason for me to wonder just what it is the movie and television critics are smoking. They love to point out the idiocy of the show, it's heavy reliance on slapstick comedy, and the improbability of it all.  Guilty on all three counts.  After all, that's what makes it so hilarious.  Yes, it's highly unlikely that the Howells would have brought along a chest full of money and enough clothes for three years on a three hour tour, or that Ginger would have brought a range of glitzy dresses, or that the Professor would have thought to bring along books on every subject known to man, or that he could create Geiger counters, explosives, vaccines, battery chargers, etc. from nothing but coconuts and palm leaves, but couldn't figure out how to patch a hole in a boat.  It's equally improbable that a tiny uncharted island would play host to a constant stream of visitors who somehow never take the castaways off or remember where it is, or that after months and even years the castaways would still be discovering things on the island they had never seen before.  Having said that, is it any more fantastic than many popular movies and shows today?  A couple of &#34;good guys&#34; who are crack shots taking on dozens or even hundreds of &#34;bad guys&#34; who somehow are unable to hit the broad side of a barn from ten feet away?  Zombies?  Vampires?  Space aliens with the technology to travel across the galaxy and crush every military on Earth but are unable to defeat a tiny group of humans armed with comparatively primitive weapons?  Seriously???  And Gilligan's Island is unlikely?  At least the events of the show, however improbable they may be, are mostly within the realm of possibility.Yet once again, it's the very unlikely nature of Gilligan's Island that makes it so funny and appealing.  I could watch every episode a hundred times over and still never get tired of it, and that seems to be the general consensus from pretty much everyone I've ever discussed this show with.  If you're looking for a break from our insane modern world with it's focus on sex, violence, and profanity, plenty of good, clean fun, and hour after hour of laughter, you can't go wrong with this timeless classic.	5.0	Still hilarious fifty years later	2014-04-02	0	0	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A4U27URFECK1U	"Chris Damon ""Classic TV & Tech Guy"""	"Great to have this set at a great price! (I picked it up for $26.99). This set used to hover around the hundred dollar mark, so when I saw it for such a low price I snatched it up. The funny thing was, I saw all three season sets at Target for $9.99 each and snatched them up prior to finding the lower price boxed set here at Amazon. I returned the season sets because I wanted the Complete Series Box. The funny thing is, Season Three does not come in the ""fat"" DVD case like the retail version I picked up at Target, and like the other 2 seasons enclosed in the box set. Season 3 comes in a standard size DVD case with a multiple disc insert to hold all five discs. It just seems strange that the manufacturer would have a different version of Season 3 for retail than for the box set, when the other two seasons seems to be the same ones that I returned to Target.The only explanation I could figure out for the revised Season 3 packaging is that the manufacturer is using the boxes designed for the original release of this title which had double sided discs originally packaged in cardboard type boxes that pulled out from the slip case to hold the discs. Possibly, the current configuration of the two ""fat"" cases and the single standard case fit in the same specs without redesigning the original case. Seasons One & Two both have six discs each, while Season Three only has five, so it is only logical that the last season would need less room.The quality of the video is great, and the audio is up to par with TV shows from this era. It's great to see Gilligan again, since I don't see the show in syndication anymore. Also the unaired pilot was cool with different characters and a different song was cool to see. Plus, there are no flipper discs anymore. All discs in this set are all single sided."	5.0	Whew! No Doubled Sided Discs In This Set!	2012-12-04	3	3	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A3SFO2GSP5CVSM	"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom"""	The charter boat S.S. Minnow, out of Honolulu, Hawaii, was on a sightseeing tour when it was caught in a storm & shipwrecked on an uncharted South Pacific island. Numerous questions abounded for nitpickers who found the show's simplicity annoying- chief among them were: If the cruise was only supposed to be for 3 hours, how & why did the passengers pack so much? Well, obviously they did not. Each episode, in a way, is a self-contained vignette, not necessarily related to the others, although some are. Producer Sherwood Schwartz has tried to cast his show as a sort of tv version of the Grimm Bros. fairy tales- with each show teaching a lesson. Others believe GI is akin to the Genesis myth- yet farcical rather than dramatic. GI shows a group of castaways exiled from the paradise of modern America, filled with fast food, modern appliances, & entertainments galore. Marooning replaces exile but instead of finding themselves lost from history they end up severed from their modernity. In truest Biblical fashion they long for Salvation- not of their souls, but of their corpi. & like mankind, eternally doomed by Adam & Eve's sin, the castaways are doomed by Gilligan's stupidity, & their own ethics for not offing him. In a way Gilligan & Co. are living cartoons- occasionally over-the-top Tex Avery toons, but more often the Nietszchean hell of the Roadrunner & Wile E. Coyote. Despite the failures, the castaways always survive- not unlike the numerous personae of Buster Keaton, or more aptly Charlie Chaplin's Tramp. Most often it's Gilligan's failings that doom the castaways. But others' failures abound: the Skipper's need to be in control, Mr. Howell's need to manipulate, Mrs. Howell's need for routine over pragmatism, the Professor's Rube Goldbergian devices, Ginger's need for attention & approval, & Mary Ann's nave-t&eacute;.So, the query is- if the characters are so dumb & predictable, why are they so beloved? Because they are archetypes, not stereotypes- despite the absurd plots. Even when treated to the stand-bys of doppelg&auml;ngers or `certain' doom, the viewer knows the episode will end just where it began- not waiting for Godot, but salvation. Still, the characterizations are so strong, that by the 3rd or 4th episode we know how every character is going to react to a certain premise. This would kill most shows- witness the dull meanderings of the 1980s mega-hit, The Cosby Show. But, being set with such a wacky initial premise allowed each episode to go off on increasingly absurd branches without viewer backlash against the characters. This allowed producer SS to moralize without being preachy- unlike, say Bill Cosby's show. This absurdism also allowed SS to have a retinue of occasional stock actors to play many parts- the most notable recurring actor being Vito Scotti- who made a handful of outrageous appearances as different characters. In a way, GI's fantastical plots allowed a lot of subtextual social commentary to go on without being heavyhanded. In this way, GI resembled another all-time tv classic- The Twilight Zone. On TTZ writer & producer Rod Serling could slip in political messages under the guise of an extraterrestrial storyline, that he could never slip by the network censors were he overtly writing about McCarthyism or racism. Similarly, GI could tackle greed, vanity, materialism, & relationships by using far out scenarios to comment on more prosaic dealings with such things. This is why viewers were drawn into the show in its network run, & have never let it go since. Despite the absurd silliness we all know versions of the 7 castaways in our own lives. This made them REAL, despite their often caricaturized state. Add in the fact that the castaways never really learn their lessons, & the parallels to reality could become depressingly obvious, were they not so hilarious. Never before nor since has tv been so existential, & simple, at the same time. The show was about total illogic, yet it made perfect sense, especially the more its slapstick & absurdism pushed the pedal to the metal.	5.0	Absurdism lives	2008-10-17	8	3	5

Here is what I found in my late 2013 shipment:- All disks are present and accounted for. Nothing missing and no duplicates. Phew.- The set used to have two-sided disks, which caused problems for some people. I got all one-sided disks, which are less likely to have flaws/reliability problems. That's an improvement. However, the studio(?) never redid the DVD menus, so each menu says that there's more material on the other side of the disk. LOL, no. Don't insert your one-sided disks upside-down!- The disks are in the flip-style plastic cases, one season per case, and the three cases are in turn housed in a single cardboard plastic box.Those flip-style boxes are pretty crummy at the best of times... even when there is no damage to them at all, it's not uncommon to find all the disks off their spindles when you open a brand new box. When my set arrived, however, there was a dent on one corner of the cardboard box, and the plastic cases were in terrible shape. One was completely broken and unusable. Another was broken enough that it was likely to fall apart and risk damage to the disks. The third was usable; however, since the other two were not, I pull all of the disks in a &#34;disk wallet&#34; for better protection.Fortunately, the disks were intact, and that's all that really matters to me. However, if you are a stickler for nice packaging, you may be taking a gamble.	4.0	Packaging is still lousy.	2014-01-19	0	0	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A9GRKDRILNAW1	D. J. Sly	"One of the worst things that ever happened to ""Gilligan's Island"" -- or 62 of the worst things, in this case 62 episodes of the television show -- was the fact that it went from black and white to color after the first season. And this isn't because the series was bad -- of course it was, one of the campiest television programs of all time, but that was part of it's charm -- but because once the network began airing the series in color, the earlier black and white episodes were largely forgotten by both the fans and networks alike; few, if any, markets were eager to syndicate the monochrome episodes when there were more than enough color ones to fill the time-slots. Which was their loss and ours, because these 34 episodes are among the finest produced during the show's three-season run. Definitely recommended for fans of the series, color or no color."	5.0	A great television show for classic TV fans	2012-02-19	0	0	0

My mom grew up on the series, too, which made it nice to watch in the mornings before school/work. So, I bought this as her Christmas gift.Anyways! 17 discs, with every episode plus all the commentary and extras you could ask for. There's just something timeless about the series; it's campy, but still makes you want to come back for more.

I briefly reviewed each of the discs and the quality seems to be excellent though single-sided discs would have been better.FYI On the original set of discs I received side B, disc 3, Season 3 was supposed to have a documentary according to the packaging. I sent the set back to Amazon because that side was actually blank and reordered the DVD set. The new discs just arrived and the packaging is slightly different. The documentary is now listed as being on side A of disc 3 and it was indeed there. There is now nothing listed for side B.Thanks to Amazon for the great return policy and amazing turnaround time.

When he was a youngster he never missed watching Gilligan's Island. I knew this was something that would bring back happy memories and fun times for him and I wanted to do something very special for him this year. A dinner, a movie, a small unmeaning gift really just wasn't what I wanted for him. This however, was a wonderful surprise and a gift that will last him for MANY years to come and one he absolutely loved. I haven't seen (or heard) much out of him since he received this gift. So, gals if you're looking for a gift that will occupy your man so you can have some ""girl time"" why not think about buying that special man a ""gift of his childhood?"""	5.0	Memories of Gilligan	2013-04-01	0	0	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A28ILXH590CMRJ	Hazen B Markoe	In 1963, the CBS television network first aired GILLIGAN&#65533;S ISLAND, a slapstick sitcom with an unusual premise. Set in a desert island with a group of castaways, this comedy turned off many of the TV critics, who savaged the show by calling it sophomoric and idiotic.  Even the network wasn&#65533;t all that thrilled with the show, having refused it three times before agreeing to air it.  To the surprise of many, the show actually became a hit, winning its time-slot every year it was on, despite being moved to a different time and day each year.  Eventually, the show was cancelled after its 3rd season to make room for another season of CBS favorite GUNSMOKE. Despite all the adversity, GILLIGAN&#65533;S ISLAND would go on to become a huge hit in syndication, where it still runs on many TV stations today......almost 40 years after it first aired.This DVD set collects the first season with all the classic black and white episodes. (The other seasons were in color.)  Bob Denver, who previously was the beatnik Maynard G. Krebs in the Dobie Gillis shows, is charming as the accident-prone Gilligan.  Alan Hale, Jr. matches him as the put-upon Skipper.  Jim Backus definitely has his share of laughs as filthy rich Thurston Howell, III, while Dawn Wells and Tina Louise provide nice contrast as the wholesome Mary Ann and sexy starlet Ginger. Natalie Shaffer and Russell Johnson provide solid support as Howell&#65533;s wife and the brainy Professor, respectively.The DVD transfer is very sharp and the special features are somewhat interesting, including the original pilot with a different Professor and Ginger, and a completely different character instead of Mary Ann, as well as commentary by series creator/producer Sherwood Schwartz.  The episode &#65533;Two on a Raft&#65533; has pop-up comments that cover some of the history surrounding the show&#65533;s creation and run. Another feature highlights the seven castaways and offers brief comments on how they evolved.  Finally is a tongue in cheek &#65533;quiz&#65533; that really doesn&#65533;t add all that much.GILLIGAN&#65533;S ISLAND wasn&#65533;t TV art, so much as TV &#65533;comfort food.&#65533;  The slapstick humor and cardboard characters were fun to spend time with and helped cement the show&#65533;s status as a popular TV icon.  For fans of the show or TV historians in general, this is a set worth recommending.	4.0	Slapstick GILLIGAN gets solid DVD treatment	2004-02-10	1	1	0
B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A26AGFVWTXKZIC	Heather English	This review is about the packaging and quality of how its put together.  I just purchased the complete series for less than $10 a season at walmart.I found most of the packages had loose discs so it took me a while to find one that had discs that weren't loose in the package (loose discs can get scratched easily) So my tip is do not buy online buy instore so you can insure that the discs are not loose.The discs are stacked on top of each other which is one thing dvd and bluray buyers strongly dislike.	3.0	Discs all stacked on top of each other....	2013-10-14	1	0	1

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A262A5FEOAR6Q8	Here-N-Now	The shows are timeless.  Slapstick humor, easy stories, and totally unbelievable - which makes it hilarious fun for adults and children.  I was looking for an alternative to some of the current TV programming, something less violent and more fun.  My husband and I decided to invest in &#34;the good old days&#34; - TV shows that used to keep us engaged and would occasionally sneak in a life lesson or two.  When it's TV time, the kids will opt for Gilligan's Island every time.  They have a lot of fun introducing the shows to their friends.  We're only into the 2nd season so far, but I have no doubt we'll be doing re-runs for a long time.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A2KFOYCPAP2BH1	History Prof	"As a kid, I loved to watch reruns after school each day of Gilligan's Island.  Oh how I wished I could visit with the characters and live in the huts with cool acessories made of bamboo and coconuts!  I bought this set (and the other seasons) to bring back those good memories and share them with my daughter.  She loves the show and we watch two episodes together at a time.  The humor is a welcome relief from the sarcasm, potty-humor, and sexual content that dominates so much of television today.  Today's kids still laugh at Gilligan and Skipper being stuck to the side of the Minnow, the duck that won't fly, Wrong Way Feldman, etc.The pilot episode is a hoot to watch (I am so glad that they changed to the Professor, Mary Ann and Ginger), and the commentary by Sherwood Schwartz is a treasure trove of information.This is a must-have for anyone who wished that they could be one of the cast-a-ways ""here on Gilligan's Isle!"""	5.0	If you loved Gilligan's Island, get this set!	2008-05-08	3	3	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	AZD1UP0GMQBSP	Homer_J_Simpson	Gilligan's Island is without a doubt one of the most recognizable  classic television shows. Gilligan's island helped paved the way for many of todays great sitcoms.  With the popularity of putting television shows on TV it is no wonder that Gilligan is going to be digitized.  At the time of this review the DVD has not yet been released but I will give my input on the show.  The first season of Gilligan's Island was in black and white.  Later seasons are in color.  The first season's theme song is slightly different because it never mentions Russel Johnson (The Proffessor) or Mary Ann.  Gilligan's island today is still one of the most syndicated show in reruns and I will be glad to own a piece of television history.  I am really hoping that the  studio releasing this DVD will be kind enough to add some Bonus Features.  Maybe show the E! True Hollywood story or Commentaries with the remaining cast members.	5.0	Another Television Landmark	2003-11-08	33	21	12

Its before&#34; Lost&#34; took air for ABC and its a lot more fun to watch.  I had never seen it from the beginning but Amazon gives you that chance and I am most grateful for it.  Here is Innocence at their best.,  it is a time before greed and lust took over television.  no one falls in love with anyone, and no one becomes each other's enemy. People had more patience for each other, and accepted the person for who they were, a well formed show that the whole family can watch.  if you want to relax and laugh, this is a show fun to watch.	4.0	Gillian's Island is fun	2014-05-08	0	0	0

Slow, silly and simple.  Not always, and not for every mood, yet it is just the thing to follow an intense action flick before bed, or for something light on in the background when its time for working,I guess you could say I'm a fan, and that to me this is classic entertainment, and what streaming media is all about.

The one where everyone thinks the island is sinking, because Gilligan is unknowingly using the professors water marking stick to catch lobsters.  Or who could forget endearing characters such as &#34;Wrong Way&#34; the pilot, and a cameo by a jungle boy played by a very young Kurt Russell.

I got this item at around $25, worth EVERY penny. I grew up watching these (so you can guess my age range) and for the last few months I've watched a few every Saturday while cooking (well, making a huge mess in the kitchen and hoping I end up with something edible). I don't know what kind of restoration was done but they are flawless - sound is good, colors in the later seasons pop out at you, and you even get the pilot with its not so great cast and some other fun extras. I'm nearly done season 3 and haven't hit any disk flaws. This is really a fantastic deal! And for the guys out there who haven't made up their minds about The Question, the image clarity of Mary Ann in her skin-tight little outfits will finally provide you with an answer.	5.0	EXCELLENT - But wait for it to go on sale	2013-09-14	0	0	0
B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	AL8DIHD83AAM6	Jacob Hodge	This was bought as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend, and we've already watched the first two seasons. The whole cast is full of lovable characters, and the 60's were a perfect time for tv.I prefer this packaging over the paper sleeve packaging anyday. This one comes in a box that the individual seasons can slide out easily, and inside the cases are discs that have their own slot instead of sliding in and out of sleeves. I definitely prefer this packaging over the other because I've had a ton of discs not work after being used so many times.

Narrator David Attenborough does his job very well.  Photography is spectacular.  The series brings you very close to the birds, but never treats them as pets.  The variety of lifestyles, body structure and markings, defense, and something i almost wanted to call wisdom makes this a very fine experience for those who appreciate the wonders of the natural world, and an invitation for others to look closer.	5.0	Marvelous series from the BBC	2014-01-22	0	0	0

I remember watching reruns of it as a kid in the early 90s and it's just as entertaining now as it was back then, if not more so (I still love the anti-ship mine episode).  Use it as stress relief after a hard day's work or a babysitter for your kids.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A32QDE1PV24Z02	Jeffrey S. Pfeiffer	"A wonderful set & nice to have all the episodes uncut & without commercial interruptions. However, one possible caveat: I'm not 100% sure but I believe Episode #1 (""Two on a Raft"") has been edited, with all the footage that it originally used from the long unseen pilot episode removed. I am rather surprised no one else has mentioned this, which makes me wonder if I am totally correct on this, but here is what I believe:I remember watching Gilligan as a kid & having seen all episodes repeatedly & having committed most to memory, I am almost certain that in the first episode (not the pilot, but the first one originally aired on TV that we all saw as kids, when the castaways first become marooned), after the shipwreck, there are several scenes that were not present in the episode when I watched it on this DVD set. Originally, there were few scenes that were taken from the pilot episode (the one without Ginger or Mary Ann, & a different Professor) and incorporated into the first episode that has forever been seen in TV airings (""Two on a Raft""). Among these scenes were a short scene of the Howells asking the Skipper to have their luggage removed, and then a discussion ensues about navy charts...Skipper saying the island they are marooned on isn't on any of his navy charts, Howell says he should have gotten his charts from a more reliable source than the US Navy....namely, the Sunnybrook Yacht Club. Another scene involves Skipper & Gilligan exploring the island and Gilligan climbing a cocoanut tree, spotting some ""people with a boat"", sliding down the tree trunk onto the Skipper (amid falling cocoanuts), and leading Skipper on a mad dash thru the jungle, only to find that the ""people"" he saw were his fellow castaways standing alongside the SS Minnow!Another hilarious scene involved Gilligan's loss of the radio & the transmitter into the ocean, and his subsequent hauling in of dozens of large fish, and discovering that both the radio and transmitter had been swallowed by the fish (the scene of Gilligan doing the actual fishing, being pulled thru the sand repeatedly to the water and ""wrestling"" with the fish he just landed is side-splitting). I distinctly remember these scenes being in the first episode, all occuring just before Gilligan & Skipper take off on the makeshift raft to find help. A year or so ago, when I saw the long-unaired pilot episode on VHS for the first time, these scene were also in that episode as well, meaning that they were re-cycled and used in the original ""first"" episode we all would see on TV, ""Two on a Raft"" (except that the scene of the castaways talking into the landed fish in order to find the transmitter had been obviously re-shot to accomodate the new Professor character, and Ginger & Mary Ann). Confused yet??Okay....so when I watched the ""Two on a Raft"" episode  on this DVD set, all the above mentioned scenes had been cut out! The episode jumped from the scene of the castaways hearing the report of their boat being lost at sea on the radio to Gilligan & Skipper's journey on the raft.  No scene of the Howells asking about their luggage being removed & the conversation about Navy charts, no scene of Gilligan up the tree, and no scene of Gilligan & the fish. And I KNOW these scenes were originally IN the episode because I watched them repeatedly as a kid & only saw the unaired pilot a few years ago.Now, I only watched the first 4-5 episodes & it's POSSIBLE these scenes were farther into the series than I remember (in which case this review is totally wrong!) but I do not think so. I am nearly certain that those scene have always been included in the episode where the castaways first land on the island. I wonder if, when this DVD set was put together and the decision made to include the original unaired pilot, they cut out all the scenes from the ""Two on a Raft"" episode that were lifted from the pilot, although I cannot imagine why. I feel this set suffers for that, as that was what made the first episode so funny. I do not find the original unaired pilot particularly funny (the original girls that were used were SO unappealing it was scary) and having those scenes available ONLY in that pilot episode is an injustice.Now, the much of the footage DOES re-appear in the Christmas episode ""Birds Gotta Fly, Fish Gotta Talk"", as the castaways recall how they ended up on the island and flashbacks are utilized, but originally they were in the first episode as well.If anyone has any info on this, or finds that I'm wrong on this, please feel free to correct. Great set otherwise!"	4.0	great set, but is episode #1 edited?	2010-01-01	7	7	0

It was a time when shows, sometimes quite silly at times, upheld a good moral standing. This is a true classic I will never get tired of. It's right up there with the Munsters and many others. Sorry, but the shows today have no imagination or thought put into them.

Page ""movie fan"""	"i'm a father of two young boys and my wife and i control what we let our boys watch on tv. most of the shows today are just not kid friendly and we don't let them watch,so we use dvds of some of our beloved old shows to let them watch. on friday nights we have ""movie and popcorn night"" at our house and they pick the shows we watch,and this is one they love.i can remember getting home from school and watching this everyday,must have seen each one 60 times i guess,so i thought i'd show them to my boys. well they are in love with the show and even play it when they go outside.if you don't know the plot by now(have you been lost on an island your whole life) i'm just going to say that 7 people who were on a ""three hour tour"" are marroned on an island and looking to get off. anyway it's silly and never tries to be anything other than fun,and it does so very well. people always attack it as dumd and worthless, but if it weren't good then why is it that after it went off first run episodes it has run everyday somewhere in the world ! i have heard that it runs 16 times a day still everyday somewhere. it never won any awards but everyone can quote the number 2 ranked theme song of all times at least part if not all of it.how many quote""great shows "" can claim that.the glue here is the late and very much unsung actor bob denver as gilligan. he's always messing up and not very smart, but his heart is in the right place and he tries, so you love him even when he messes up. alan hale jr. as the skipper is just as good in a role that could be just a mean man who gets mad at gilligan and stands over him, but hale is so loveable and so silly himself that you see that these two guys really do have a father son kind of relasionship that the skipper never comes off as mean,a very fine line that makes the show so good. jim backus as mr. howell is just right with his i'm better than this airs ,but never so much that he becomes someone to hate you grow to love him and natalie schafer as mrs. howell and once again that takes great acting to walk that fine line. tina louise as ginger is very good also.my first crush as a child dawn wells is mary ann the farm girl who at least in the first season looks to be a possiable love intrest for gilligan, and she shines  in a role that could have been lost among the rest of the cast. russell johnson is the professor, who could build a a-bomb from to coconuts but couldn't fix a 2"" hole in a boat, and he gives the show it's answer to the problem of the week in fine comedy tone.sherwoods schwarts, the person who created the show, gave us a nice message also about how they got along together and worked for the common good instead of only looking out for themselves. so silly and very slap stick in presention, but a nice little message tucked in there also.so 5 satrs for the show that will never die,and a show i'm proud to show my kids and can leave the room for a second and don't have to worry about bad words,vilonce,or over the top sex being seen by my kids because it's kid friendly. that my boys sit with me and laugh and we talk about things while we do makes this one to add to the collection.  p.s. this first season is in black & white"	5.0	"a forty year ""three hour tour"" that still keeps us laughing"	2006-03-27	5	5	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A17HAXMBGXCEH9	John Gregory	I remember watching Gilligan's Island reruns back in the 70s.  That was before they started editing everything to death to add more commercials.  The last time I saw the show on tv a few years ago it was cut up so much to insert all the extra commercials that you could probably watch an entire episode in ten minutes if you cut out the commercials.  This collection includes the full uncut episodes.  In fact, there are some scenes in certain episodes that I don't remember seeing at all, even from watching it back in the 70s.  The picture and sound are perfectly clear.  I've only noticed one glitch in one of the episodes and that was in the opening credits.  There's a slight pixelation in the picture for a split second.  The only bad thing I have to say about this collection is the price.  It jumps all over the place.  I bought it around last Thanksgiving for $36.  Shortly after Christmas the price more than doubled.  A few weeks ago it had dropped to $46.  Now, it's back over $70 again.  I'll pay $36 for it and even $46 for it but there's no way I would pay over $70.  Fifty dollars would probably be the absolute highest I would pay for it.	5.0	Great collection	2009-03-17	2	2	0

I have no problem with the double sided DVD's (remember, what it says on the side facing up is what you get when it plays. If you can see &quot;side B&quot; staring at you when you put it in the player, that is what will play), no problem with the rather attractive fold-out case (which includes helpful synopes of the episodes on the cover, without spoilers no less. Very thoughfully done). I have alot of DVDS and these were easier than average to remove from the case (Star Trek: Next Gen were far more difficult, for example).Add to that the extremely favorable price and this is surely one of the best buys in DVD land.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A11XKY4EIU2KNR	"Johny Bottom ""Insane and lonely guitarist"""	Thank the dark pits of Hell for finally releasing my favorite all time show, GILLIGAN's ISLAND. The seven deadly sins are personified as the castaways deserted on an island (purgatory). Here's a lowdown for those not familiar with the show....1. Pride - The Professor (Russel Johnson) is the smartest man alive. He made a working satellite out of bamboo once. His pride was his downfall. No matter how smart he was and proud of his acheivments, he never went anywhere.2. Greed - The Millionaire (Jim Buckus) was the greediest man on the planet. He took millions of dollars and an expansive wardrobe with him on a three hour tour. But for all his money, he couldn't buy the island.3. Envy - Mary-Ann (Dawn Wells) wanted to be Ginger so badly. One episode she gets knocked on the head and thinks she IS Ginger. Little farm girl could never be more than what she was.4. Lust - Ginger Grant (Tina Louise) The Hollywood movie star was the walking, talking sin of lust itself. She was enough to make any mortal man fall to his knees with desire.5. Gluttony - The Skipper (Alan Hale) Not only was he a fat dude to begin with, but he couldn't help but wof down every coconut and banana creme pie he could get his hands on.6. SLoth - Mrs. Howell had no use or purpose. Rarely was she involved in the plot. She probably spent most of her time sleeping in the hut she shared with Thirston.7. Wrath - Gilligan (Bob Denver) The angriest man to ever walk the planet. His rage was disguised as stupidity as his bumbling kept everyone on the island. He wanted them there, because he was evil.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A3E5DOAY5VUB1E	"Jon G. Purkey ""jpurkey"""	I purchased this set about six weeks ago and have been watching it off and on since then. I bought it when it was being sold for just $45.99. Not sure if that was a one time deal, but as others have said, you might find it cheaper to get the three seaons individually. Or just wait until the price comes down again.There is not a huge amount of special features, but that's not a big deal to me since I just want to watch the episodes. The video quality is very good. And as far as I can tell, the episodes are unedited, averaging about 25 minutes and 30 seconds each.My only complaint is the double sided and poorly labeled discs, though it's not enough to lower my rating from 5 stars. I put my purchased DVDs into thin jewel cases and with the doubled siders ot is easy to get them mixed up.And BTW, season 3:disc 3:side B is blank. So don't waste any time trying to get that disc to load, like I did, if you happen to check your DVDs for errors before watching them. That DVD had smudges on it, so believing it was like the other seasons, I spent several minutes cleaning and trying to load it in two different players before deciding to check the box and finding there was no content listed for 3B. If it had been a regular one-sided disc (like other TV series do when side B is blank) it sure would have help.	5.0	Great set, Wait for the right price.	2009-05-20	9	8	1
B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A1KTJVO2QF4O43	"Jonny J. ""GoPenguins09"""	I grew up watching Gilligan and when I seen this on Amazon I HAD to have it. My wife and daughter laughed at me when I bought it, but after I put a dvd in one Saturday morning I would catch my 14 year old daughter laughing at the ridiculous episodes. &#34; This is stupid&#34; she would say. But after a few episodes she admitted it was kinda funny. I even caught her watching Gilligan reruns on local tv a few weeks later!! It has it all. Keep it in your favorites and wait for the price to drop. I paid only $29.69!! (in June)That is a steal!!	5.0	I love this show.	2014-01-10	0	0	0
B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A2Y821KCZ5POJY	Jordan L. Hughes	Bought this in August as a Christmas present for my daughter. I didn't check it too closely when it arrived, because the packaging was great. She opened it this morning (Christmas), and instead of having seasons 1-3 she has two season ones, and season three. Season two was not in the set. From now on I won't assume that when you buy a set of dvd's that someone didn't package it wrong.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A18CAAN6H7BY8E	Joseph A. Krieter	I remember watching Gilligan' Island as a kid, though the series lasted only 3 yrs, I aways made time to see it. It always made me laugh then..and still now as an adult. As a kid I was never able to see all of the series in sequence, no matter how much I waited to catch them even in reruns for that matter. With this series of ALL 98 episodes, now I can watch them ALL! Yes, some maybe a little stretch and strained for getting laughs, but they were Clean, Simple and had a lesson sometimes in there too. But most of all it made me laugh. Simplistic yes, honest yes, fun, yes; a precursor to Survivor-No, for no money; back stabbing reality TV here just to gain ratings.With so many episodes, I did not realize that I had missed so many of them. It's like looking at them for the first time. I've been to Universal Studio's here in CA a few yearsback, before the fire at the studio lot and remember seeing the Little lot they used to film the series. Can't believe how they did it but then I realize it was all to have fun and make people laugh, (and make money too). If you want to reminisce and pull on memories on life's simplier times, than get this series and make Lots of pop-corn to enjoy it all the way through.	5.0	The Fun Days on Gilligan's Island to laugh and enjoy again	2009-08-01	3	2	1

Their interaction was to represent world politics. Keeping that in mind when you view it will be a whole new experience. That could make for some lively discussions.The guys out there can also ponder the age old question: Ginger or Mary-Ann?And for the ladies, I don't know, Gilligan or Skipper?The first season of this charming show was in black and white, so let's hope they don't colorize it!	5.0	Definitely Ginger!	2003-11-21	12	6	6

But it stands up very well against the one-dimensional sitcoms that are being shown on network and cable programming today.  The characters are charming, likable, and largely moral people. Especially refreshing, is the 'clean' comedy.  And the acting stands up pretty well against the new low-standards in sitcoms on the network and popular big cable channels.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A14W8HXP3RM3ZS	Jukebox Dave	"GILLIGAN'S ISLAND-THE COMPLETE SERIES: If only for the jaunty sing-a-long theme neatly summarizing their plight, the premise of GILLIGAN'S ISLAND is burned indelibly into the minds of practically everyone who's ever clicked on the boob-tube...seven shipwrecked castaways including a millionaire couple, a genius, and two smokin' sex kittens (one who knew it and one who didn't) with only their beloved SKIPPER and his hapless first mate GILLIGAN as ""leaders"". All roles were played to the absolute hilt; BOB DENVER (fresh off his DOBIE GILLIS stint as work-shy beatnik MAYNARD G. KREBBS) was a bungling STAN LAUREL to ALAN HALE's slow-burning OLIVER HARDY, while JIM (MR. MAGOO) BACKUS' hilariously money-hungry THURSTON HOWELL III and TINA LOUISE' MARILYN MONROE-channeled movie starlet GINGER GRANT were also stand-outs. Coconut telegraphs, sail-tailored sarongs, and fantasy dream sequences aside, the most preposterous part of GILLIGAN was the dizzying array of guest stars momentarily stranded on the very same uncharted tropic isle (including ZSA ZSA GABOR, a pre-teen KURT RUSSELL, and PHIL SILVERS) and the crew's astounding inability to turn these invasions into a ticket back home. Astronauts, Japanese sailors and headhunters were also commonplace in creator SHERWOOD SCHWARTZ' slapstick microcosm of society, which spawned two cartoon spinoffs, three hugely popular reunion movies, and a short-lived DENVER-led rip off series called DUSTY'S TRAIL.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A2I4WF84MWIBO7	Kai Lu	"Gilligan's Island has often been an object of ridicule for both professional critics and self-annointed intellectuals alike, most of whom point out the various implausibilities in the show (i.e., the Professor is an ""idiot"" because he can cause nuclear fission using coconuts but can't build a raft, the unliklihood of the Howells taking a ""three hour tour"" on an obviously inexpensive charter boat, let alone taking along three season's worth of wardrobe and costumes with them, ad nauseum), but chances are these same critics have also seen many -- if not all -- the show's episodes, and have enjoyed at least a few guilty laughs for their trouble.One of the reasons why Gilligan's Island is such a great show (it is the most re-run show in the history of television, and that INCLUDES I Love Lucy) is precisely because it is so wacky, nonsensical, and flat-out ridiculous.In Gilligan's Island -- The Complete First Season, viewers are treated to 34 original episodes, uncut, including the rare pilot episode that contains three castmembers not included in the actual show as seen on television. The episodes are in black and white, but this doesn't detract from the fun.The complete list and brief synopsis of each episode have already been written by other reviewers so I won't waste your bandwith in repeating them, however I will say one thing: seeing these episodes brings back many fond memories for me, and I didn't even realize how much of a fan of the show I was until I watched this 3-DVD set.I remember coming home from school in eigth grade each day and seeing Gilligan's Island on TV, and that was over ten years ago. I hadn't seen an episode of Gilligan's Island in the intervening years until I bought the DVD set. It's amazing, but I -- and probably countless other people -- could actually remember everything about the episodes, and my memory comes flooding back with the viewing of each one, right down to the manner in which a character pronounces certain words, and the way the Skipper cries out ""Aeuph!"" whenever Gilligan accidently hits his captain in the breadbasket, or inadvertantly drops something on his vulnerable feet, or the way Tina Louise's mouth twitches in an oddly fascinating way when her picture is shown on the program's opening credits.Gilligan's Island is one of those shows that you can watch today and enjoy, even if you've never seen it, as long as you don't expect it to make sense or follow any logic. It's one of those show's you can LOVE if your viewing of that show is connected to fond memories of your own past -- as for me, it includes summer vacation, playing Sega Genesis, playing nerf football with my best friends Howie and Art, and watching Gilligan's Island.My friend Art has since become a lawyer, and Garth became an architect. I teach in a middle school. We all grow up, but Gilligan stays with us all along the way. It's wise to pick this set up, especially if you're a fan of the show, because it's one way you can relive and continue to live a pleasant part of your own history."	5.0	It's funny precisely because it's so incredibly ridiculous	2006-05-11	144	138	6

Every day after school, I went to Gilligan's Island and got to watch them try to get off the island.  They were the most resourceful people I ever saw.  According to the song, they only went out for a 3 hour tour to look at the scenery.  Yet, the more I watch it now, for as many years as they were there, they never ran out of food or water and their clothes always looked like new, never faded, but they could never persuade anyone who accidentally ended up on the island to take them home with them.  And they were never bitter.  They just kept keeping on and making coconut cream pies and being hospitable.  That was entertainment, and I still enjoy watching it.	5.0	A three hour tour?	2014-03-21	0	0	0

WELL that is not going to happen now I just got my second request to move up the delivery date to June 3rd by 8:00pm because they can't send it for resons they can't explain to me the buyer. This is just outragous. I have ordered from Amazon for years and never had this issue not sure what is the issue but I will be checking other places to purchase things now. Amazon has been very disapointing and has not offered any discount or free shipping which is crazy after this wait.  I will be moving on to look else were.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	ALTTTW14FF7LM	lisa hourin	Grew up watching Gilligan's Island and decided to try it out with my kids a few days ago.  We've only watched 3 episodes, but it's awesome.  My kids (especially the 8 year old) are literally rolling on the floor over Gilligan.  Honestly, I'm surprised they're this into it, but am so glad we bought the first season.  Way, WAY better than almost any kids show these days (wow, that makes me sound old...but seriously.  They also love Hannah Montana and Horseland.  This is a bazillion times more preferable for them to be watching, in my opinion).	5.0	HYSTERICAL (for the 8 and 10-year-old!)	2014-01-14	0	0	0

He's 10 and thinks it's so much better than most of the shows on right now. I think he enjoys singing the theme as much as watching the show. It's great for myself as a parent to know they're watching something that's meant for family viewing.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A2VN42V9OA7ASB	marc	Gilligan's Island is a hilarious show, you can't go wrong with it. The plot of the individual episodes is ridiculous and nonsensical, but still entertaining and enjoyable.  The humor is mostly revolved around how Gilligan's an idiot and constantly screwing up whatever of the group attempts to do, though it never really gets stale.  I highly recommend the show as its always been of my favorites.	5.0	Classic TV's Best	2011-10-31	0	0	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A100F7SP0XY7X6	Markc	Gillian island is one of the most iconic sitcoms if the baby boomers generation. Seven people so diverse in their background taking a 3 hr cruise get caught in a hurricane and ae stranded on and island. This bizzare cast if characters survive day to day living off the inventions of a science teacher, a bumbling crew, two elderly millionaires, and of course my favorite two beautiful women ( a farm girl and a movie star). They encounter everything from headhunter natives to Russian cosmonauts? How they ever got anyone to watch it was amazing, but they did and millions if views like myself, fell in love with the cast and characters and they unusual stories episode after episode. Although over 50 years old and most of the cast passing on, this sitcom has survived to be one of the most successful in history and many generations of viewers.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A2Z02PHM5V7QWN	Mark Gage	This tv show is one of the greatest shows of all time. I grew up watching it and still watch it from old VHS tapes I have. I am a old classic tv show fan and have thousands of episodes on VHS tape including all 98 episodes of Gilligan&quot;s Island. Now with many shows on DVD, the picture quality and sound are so much better then the VHS tapes. I also collect books from the old 60's and 70's series. Three books of great interest to Gilligan's Island fans are the following: Inside Gilligan's Island by Author- Sherwood Schwartz, #2. Here on Gilligan's Isle by Author Russell Johnson with Steve Cox, and #3. Gilligan, Maynard and Me, by Author Bob Denver. They are all very interesting to read and give good behind stage information from cast members and Sherwood Schwartz.I bought this first season box set when it first was released and I will have to say that the picture quality and sound are great. Also, the price is very good. I have my favorite episodes of the show and in the first season, these are my personal favorites. 1. &quot;Two on a Raft&quot;, 2. &quot;Home Sweet Hut&quot;, 10. &quot;Waiting for Watubi&quot;, 15. &quot;So Sorry, My Island Now&quot; 24. &quot; The Return of Wrongway Feldman&quot;, and 35. &quot;My Fair Gilligan&quot;. All of the shows are worth watching. So enjoy as much as I have with my children.	5.0	One of the Greatest Shows of all Time	2004-08-03	5	5	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A2LU6W0TWRPINI	Mark	Gilligan's Island was a iconic comedy series.  The first season, which was filmed in black and white, was the funniest.  Lots of sight gags/slapstick as well as social commentary and political humor.  It is also the season where you can hear all of the characters' full names in one of the transistor radio reports that were so integral to the show, except for Gilligan, who is just called Gilligan.	4.0	B&W Episodes Were The Funniest	2013-06-04	1	0	1
B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A2CG4UR3T6AN86	MarkJ	My brother and I would come home from school, put together a snack, and sit down to watch Gilligan's Island every weekday when we were kids. I'm glad to see the series on DVD and my wife and I are enjoying it very much.This must be a remake of an earlier release. The DVD menus and box documentation indicates that there are episodes on the back side of the DVDs. However, this release has all the episode on a single side (which I like far better). The DVD menus still say that there are episodes on the back side, so someone must have forgotten to edit that out in this remake because all of the episodes on that DVD are still listed in the menu, and you can access the episodes without turning the DVD over. I can live with that!The stories are still as funny as ever. Sure they are a bit corny, but fun to relive. Many good laughs! If you are a Gilligan's Island lover, you will enjoy these DVDs. So far, not a single glitch, pause, or problem with the DVDs and the packaging allows for keeping your DVDs in good shape.	5.0	Enjoying the nostalgia of a day long gone	2013-12-14	1	1	0

The DVD transfer is very clean and the colors (on the color episodes) is super vibrant.  In fact, I was playing season two on my 52&#34; HDTV at a party and people were amazed how clear it was.  The quality is first rate.  There are a few extras, but nothing to write home about.  Definitely worth the price!  Every single uncut episode is here.  The one extra that IS awesome to have is the pilot with a different cast in many of the roles.  Its really neat to see...and a completely different opening theme song too.The only way they could improve on this collection is to add more extras, outtakes and bloopers would be really fun to see, maybe an isolated music track.  Oh yea, and Blu-Ray would take it over the top!	5.0	Still one of my favorite vintage TV shows!!	2012-12-11	1	1	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A10Y3199ULJKXW	Mezz	The critics that despise this show were not intelligent enough to understand that sometimes in life the best reality is pure fantasy. There are those who give the tired arguement about unrealistic plots and a stupid premise. They need to understand it is a television comedy show we are talking about which is suppose to be an escape from reality.The ensemble cast is superb , the comedy writing is top notch and the direction is right on the money. The reason why this is such a classic show is that it can be enjoyed by both children and adults on two different levels. Long live Sherwood Schwartz and his castaways , they will now live on forever on DVD.Buy it now , and then just sit right back and enjoy !	5.0	A Three hour tour lasting over 40 years	2004-02-09	1	1	0

I want them to know the world was not always like the way it is now.  Of course they love them.  My son likes the pilot episode with the different song intro the best.  What else can be said?  It's Gilligan's Island, it's every episode.However it is a bit of an investment of your hard earned money.  I recommend backing up YOUR disks to a hard drive or even copying them to another DVD and watching those, to keep these safe from scratches.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A3KTKMB6KLP6FS	Michael J. Andress	I have fond memories of watching Gilligan's Island in the 60's. Funny with characters one could like. There were moments I remember where I thought what fun it would be to be there. I was in my mid-teens.Those memories prompted me to check Prime to see if it was available. It was. All Right! Or so I thought...NOT! Fond memories was the best part of watching it again. Maybe getting old has jaded my perception but the silliness of Gilligan's Island previously worth watching now seems just plain stupid. The dialog borders on inane at best and banal at worst. Gilligans antics can only be described using a politically incorrect term that would be bleeped out. The millionaire and his wife are pompous and pampered overbearing rear ends. Marianne is still just as pretty and just as dumb and I won't even say what I think of the movie star. The professor is - well - still the professor.Not worth the time to even preview.	2.0	Dated Show - Great in the 60's - Not so much 50 years Later	2014-01-23	4	0	4

I love the Black and White! Its the way the show was intended to be seen. Many people have knocked the Double sided DVDs, But I actually like them. It keeps the price way down! I only paid $19.99 for this. Compare that to any other complete 1st season TV Dvd set. The pilot epsiode was also cool to have(I had never seen it). I actually liked the Bunny character. I laughed my tail off at Gillian in this episode...(like when he dropped the bullets in the campfire!)...I have to admit the rest of the special features are not all that, but I bought it for the episodes anyways. As for as the packaging, yeah I would have like to had a booklet with all the info instead of it being on the box, but again, this helped cut costs. I hope Season 2 and 3 are double-sided dvds as well. I really love the cheaper price.	5.0	Gilligan Rocks!	2004-08-18	7	6	1

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A14V5RFW94TJN	M. McHale	"Gilligan's Island: Complete Series CollectionI ordered this series not knowing exactly what I was going to get. Everything I read says you get all 3 seasons on 9 discs. Some people said they were double sided discs. I just got mine and I was surprised to find 3 individual boxes inside a sleeve for them. I looked in each season and found all the discs are single sided and each season has a booklet in the front telling what is on each disc.The 1st season has 6 discs and it is in black and white. The special features does include the series premier with a different Professor, Ginger and Mary Ann. So as far as content these seem the same as what everyone is describing.The 2nd season also has 6 discs but I think everyone else has described the story line so I'm not going to.The 3rd season has 5 discs.So as far as packaging I am very happy and I'm glad they are single sided discs. The sleeve that holds all the seasons looks just like the one in the picture. The disc holders in each box are the ones that you flip like a book to go from one disc to the next. They are plastic and the disc just snaps in like any other holder you've seen. I have been happy with those as long as the little nibs that hold each ""page"" in the box don't break.

If you have seen one episode, you have seen them all.  Each episode revolves around some outlandish plot to escape the island and is filled with the same lame pratfalls of Gilligan that lost it's charm after the virgin time.There are better tv sitcoms that deserve to be re-visited, Gilligan's Island is NOT one of them.	2.0	Rose colored glasses anyone?	2005-11-15	56	5	51

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A1XXCCTLTDI0B	"Movie Maniac ""Classic Rocker and Movie Lover"""	This is one of my favorite old sitcoms. This show stars Bob Denver as Gilligan, Alan Hale as the Skipper, Jim Backus as Thurston Howell III, Natalie Schaeffer as Mrs. Thurston Howell III, Tina Louise as Ginger Grant, Russell Johnson as the Professor, Dawn Wells as Mary Ann.There are 36 episodes and they are all great. The DVD extras aren't as good as the cover says they are. The only thing I liked was the Rare Pilot episode and the Tropical Tidbits Trivia. The ones that I didn't like were the Gilligan's Island Survival Guide and Before the Three-Hour Tour. But everything else is superb. The DVD package includes 3 discs. One good thing is that every disc has episodes on both sides, 7 episodes on each side.

It seems there is nothing but violence and low-quality shows made for teenagers.  With Gilligans Island, they see some real comedy with quality.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	ANUJUFRP6RNA2	O'Dryden	This is the best of the three Gilligan's Island series. Many of the episodes focus on the castaways adapting to their new environment. The plots seem more creative and are not as strange as many of the shows in the last two seasons. Season one contains episodes that actually seem like situations that would happen on a deserted island such as: South Pacific superstitions; determining who is in charge of the group; attempts to repair the boat; finding lost treasure; dwindling supplies of fresh water; a stranded Japanese WW II soldier; encounters with wild animals; and visits from nearby natives. Even the guests from modern civilization that visit the island seem to fit the motif of the island better than the visitors that appear in the next two seasons. This is also the only season to contain a Christmas special. My kids really like the shows and watch them all the time. The character of Gilligan seems a little more toned down in Season 1 than in the other two. Although he is a complete bumbling goofball in this season, his ignorance, naivety, and absentmindedness seem to be intensified in the later seasons. Even though Season 1 is in black and white, I still like it the best.	5.0	Season 1 is Number 1	2007-02-21	8	8	0

The kids have favorite episodes and we have been subjected to Gilligan overload.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A1U7OIFDNYQ4IR	Pedal Man	"Bought this because of a nostalgia fit one night. So many times, the shows I loved as a young 'un haven't held up, but I put one of these discs on, and I'm watching for several hours.  Can't watch just one episode, I wind up watching all seven episodes on each side of the disc.  My sister thought her kids should see where so many of our pop culture references come from and borrowed Season One.  Even her eleven year old internet/facebook/ipod/gadget-encrusted-cell-phone-addicted youngest loves the shows.  She put on the first disc and immediately said, ""Oh, no, black and white, this sucks"", but as soon as it got going, she was hooked.  Now I have to bring another disc every time I visit or I get read the riot act.  And her kids are spouting Gilligan's Isle references and quotes that their friends don't get, so they bring their friends over to watch so they can get with the program.  Disc one of season one has the original pilot(pre-Ginger/Mary Anne) and also has great pop-ups for the 'first' episode that give all kinds of interesting trivia info.  Useless, but totally cool, that is. And watching all the stars that used to guest on the show is great.  Watching a 12 year old Kurt Russell as 'Jungle Boy', Phil Silvers, Larry Storch, Don Rickles, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and other great character actors, Gilligan was a show actors asked to do because it was good and for the exposure, because it KILLED in the ratings.  My only complaint is on the flip-disc format.  I know it's cheaper and there'd be twice as many discs otherwise, but in my experience they scratch SO much easier than regular discs, and even when it came, side one/disc three/season one had a big scratch too close to the edge of the disc for my 'Skip Doctor' to buff out, so one episode doesn't play.  If not for that scratch, I'd have given this a full five star rating, as the shows deserve.  But there are 35 other episodes in the season, so I can miss one and still be happy with the rest of the package.  Seasons Two and Three are in color, and have the revised theme song.  Overall, I'm VERY happy I bought this.  And even though it's completely useless information, I now know Gilligan's first name, the Skipper's name, the Professor's name, and Mary Anne's last name.  It doesn't matter that nobody under thirty has any idea what I'm talking about, it's great to me. Meteors, robots, headhunters, dictators, a Japanese soldier who doesn't know WWII is over, mad scientists, a grenade-throwing gorilla, the 'Gilligan' version of Hamlet-the Musical, it's pure entertainment."	4.0	It's STILL great.	2010-12-25	4	4	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A20BWHQ8E4S42E	Petong	I fondly remember watching Gilligans island every day. I was recently looking for some things to occupy my time preparing for a surgery that was going to have me off my feet for a few weeks. I purchased Gilligans Island the complete collection. What a complete dissapointment this purchase was. The video quality was ok but on most shows the sound was altered so that the men did not sound like themselves. The sound of the voices of the men was lower in tone and just was not normal sounding. Additionally, the sound was out of sync with the video which made you feel like you were watching one of those old Japanese movies where the english voices were dubbed in after the movie was made. Overall, a poor duplication of a classic TV show. Save your money and buy something else.	1.0	Favorite memories lost	2011-07-19	27	8	19
B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	ABFLG7Y4D2YQH	Phantim	"This is a dvd that I keep going back to.  I remember as a kid watching after school and being entertained.  The slapstick style comedy is silly but keeps you smiling.For me, one of the funniest episodes of the whole series is in season one.  ""Diogenes, Won't You Please Go Home"" is a classic.  Gilligan is tied to a tree and about to be shot from the Japanese Sailor.  The lovable and usually helpless Ginger appears from behind a tree to save him.  Since Ginger normally uses her looks to get what she wants, you think that she is going to do the same here.  But instead of sweet talking or smiling, she engages the sailor in a judo fight in which she flips him to the ground...several times.  I remember the first time I saw this episode as a kid, I was so amazed and off guard.  It was soooo funny.  The sailor would attack her several times, only to be fliped on the ground with a loud thud.  The scene keeps flashing to Gilligans facial expressions.  He looks like he can't believe what he is seeing.  She then knocks out the sailor with a karate chop and announces ""So much for him"".  I remember laughing at this days later.  I had never seen anything like it. Ginger - good looking and able to beat up men when necessary.  Whoever wrote that scene is a very clever.  It is still my favorite scene in the series."	4.0	Ginger a Judo Expert!!!	2007-02-20	3	3	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A39GW5CBWTIWAZ	Phil S.	"In Sherwood Schwartz's interesting commentary, we hear that the idea was to present a ""micocrosm"" of society, odd couples if you will, forced to get along or perish, on an isolated spot in the Pacific. I always thought it was what Desi Arnaz said in a TV Guide article. It was about ""a couple of sexy girls on an island"".Well, thanks, partner. That's what got me going in 1964 and got be buying this DVD-set. (Now, at age 57, it isn't ""Mary Ann or Ginger"", it's ""Mrs. Howell"". That's another story...). Dawn Wells had Daisy Dukes before Catherine Bach! Or is it that Bach had ""Mary Ann""(s). Either way, she was/is still way hot.Gotta feel a little bad about Tina Louise, who expressed early on her disatisfaction with the show. As I recall, she said in an interview at vthe time, that the show was ""like a cartoon""...not to be taken seriously. I may be wrong, but I believe she has never attended a G. I. convention.The Series pilot, with different Mary Ann(s) and Ginger(s) was actually pretty good. I don't recall who was who, but the wisecracking Secretary and her [apparent] co-worker were very telegenic...and it's tough to say, but the show could have sustained with the originals, who brought in a bit more ""realism"". The TL-Ginger was all Marilyn Monroe. The Brunette was a New Yorker in temperment..would have traveled through time alot easier than ""Ginger Grant"".Schwartz says, in effect, he created a great show with characters the equivalnet if Laurel and Hardy, Monroe, whoever. By the way, I'm surprised he didn't admit to referencing the first ""Fat and Skinny""s final movie shot in France, 1950-51, involving a bunch of folks stranded on on atoll and including a glamorous model/singer, Suzie DeLair. If Schwartz didn't have that in mind...I'll eat my derby!All episodes have a good story and some surprisingly clever dialogue. Guess I was too busy at the time, waiting for Mary Ann to climb a tree.Interesting that Ida Lupino directed some of these black and white shows, though one was perhaps the very worst of the entire series: to force the Skipper to fall asleep to have his recurring dream about a World War II incident in which he managed, heroically, to turn a radio receiver into a transmitter, the residents use Mr. Howell's sleeping pills very carelessly and we are supposed to laugh when The Skipper passes out. I'm actually surprised that bit was left in the show, considering that children were obviously a big demographic for the show.A better entry is ""Wrong Way Feldman"" with Hans Conried - his plane from the '30s is discovered by Gilligan, then the pilot shows up. Alot of wild business, resulting in ""Wrong Way"" returning home successfully. Too bad, he (characteristically) couldn't figure out his own coordinates, to send a rescue team back.A nice episode called ""President Gilligan"" has some witty satire (and again recalls ""Atoll K"" with L & H: a great scene in that crazy flick also involves an ""Election"", though Hardy is victorious).Jim Backus hd the best lines and delivered them in style; sometimes reminiscent of W. C. Fields, probably another childhood idol of Sherwood Schwartz.Despite the huge success, not all the critics were wrong. There was alot of lame material not helped by that laughtrack. Gilligan trips on a rope...gales of laughter.Good DVD quality and good packaging."	3.0	"""fun family fare"" - 1964"	2008-12-27	6	5	1

It's hard sometimes to find something that will engage the 8 year old, the 3 year old, and all the kids in between.  This series does it.  It's funny (obviously not in a sophisticated way), the plot is easy to follow, it's not too long, and there are no scary bad guys (the bad guys are just laughable).

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A265JCJWCZK7QC	Rebecca Porter	Gilligan's Island was a fun show to watch with strange events for the people trapped on an Island.  If you catch an episode on television it is alway a good half hour of fun.All the charactors try to maintain there normal lives in a situation that is not quite normal.  Of course the Professor (Russell Johnson) tries his best to create things to keep things like home with a proper dose of measured seriousness, and to get them home, but it is not quite home if you are millionaires (the Howells, Jim Backus, Natalie Schafer ) or a movie star (Ginger Grant ,Tina Louise ) who always provided many laughs because of trying to maintain what they were.Mary Ann (Dawn Wells) and the Skipper (Alan Hale) seemed to be the most grounded and of course Gilligan (Bob Denver) with his uncanny ability to thwart attempts to get off the island.This collection and bonus material brings the entire first season to life and provides insights to the show.Definate DVD to purchase if you like the older classic shows or Gilligan's Island.	5.0	Welcome Home	2008-10-03	2	2	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	AXC4OG5GQ9A58	"R. Miller ""drifter2k"""	"Gilligan's Island isn't shakespeare but it is, in my opinion, the best escapist TV series of all time. There are many reasons why, a few reasons being:1.) The diversity of the characters and the talents of the actors. For instance, the chemistry between Alex Hale Jr and Bob Denver alone is as strong as you will find in any series. No matter how badly Gilligan messes things up you know that Skipper would never want anything bad to happen to his 'little buddy'. All the other cast members do a great job with their roles in creating likeable people with flaws but not without love for each other.2.) Almost everyone has thought about what it would be like to be stranded on a deserted island so the show represents a fantasy shared by many.3.) The way the characters solve problems and cope with each other is an example we all should learn to live by. They are all from different walks of life yet in the end all work towards a common goal: to get off the island as a group.I received the DVDs from amazon.ca today and have to say that I'm very pleased with the package. For those who are concerned about 36 episodes being crammed onto 3 discs, don't worry, the discs are double-sided. Also, the episodes are in the original glorious black and white, not the blotchy peach-faced ones shown on TV most of the time these days.The commentary by Sherwood Schwartz on the pilot episode is very interesting and the optional ""Topical Tidbits"" popups on episode one are worth a look too, as are the profiles on each of the castaways. The Gilligan's Island Survival Guide is not worth watching at all but, thankfully, it's very short. The only other negative besides this that I can think of is that there are no chapter stops, but with the high quality of the product I can live without them.As to the eternal question Mary Ann or Ginger? My vote will always be Mary Ann as she isn't as shallow as Ginger, is more talented, and is in my opinion more attractive!"	5.0	Best Escapist Show of All Time!	2004-02-02	0	0	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO	Robert Badgley	I must admit I have been quite tardy in picking up my copy of this first season of Gilligans Island which has been out almost two years now.I had fond memories of this light hearted show which I hadn't seen since it went off the air many years ago.I knew it wasn't critically acclaimed at the time nor a great show but it did have its' merits and was cute.I first watched the accompanying pilot and went through its few extras which was just a small laugh-umentary,some factoids on each cast member and just one audio commentary by creater Schwartz during the pilot episode.When I finally got through the first few episodes I found my fond memories fading fast.I knew back then that this was light TV fare but I now realized just how light it was.The show had its' memorable characters and moments certainly and the cast was wonderfully picked for their parts.I can see why it has retained its' charm for many throughout the years and earned itself a small niche in TV history.But I found that the more episodes I watched the more tedious they became....sad to say.Nor does the show,in my oppinion,stand up over time or bear up over repeated watchings.The first season is high on physical comedy to be sure.Gilligan and the Skipper are the Laurel and Hardy of the island,from the overall gags,to their looks(fat and skinny)and right down to their pratfalls.The Skippers' constant camera looks and mannerisms are especially indicative of Oliver Hardy(Alan Hales' father appeared coincidentally in Laurel and Hardys' 1936 great classic 'Our Relations').Season two and into three would see less and less of the physical comedy with more emphasize on their overall situation and the professors' wild inventions but the resemblance to Laurel and Hardy never went away.One reason for Gilligans Islands' final fadeout rests I believe with its concept and it's losing its' touch with reality.In the beginning we could certainly empathize with these people and their predicament,getting caught in a storm,getting stranded then having to survive until rescued.But all good comedy is rooted in some kind of reality,there has to be some thread or connection from show/movie to the viewer that says yes I can believe that this is possible(however slight)and I can relate to these characters.As time went on the shows' believability factor simply just faded away.Even in the first season,just for example,they are visited by a surfer from Hawaii who comes and goes on a rogue Tsunami!!And the plots continued to get wackier and more full of holes than a block of swiss cheese.Then there are the professors' inventions which somehow got more intricate and sophisticated as the show wore on.By the time the show hit its' final season ,even for a comedy,it had lost any empathy or believability and became a parody of itself.It was for lack of a better word just plain silly with little or no real humour left.In conclusion if you're looking for some VERY light 60s TV fare this is for you.It is certainly not classic,timeless or great TV comedy but I must admit it does retain a certain amount of charm,the acting is good and it does have its' humourous moments.Just check your brain at the door and you'll have a good time!	3.0	"One busy ""deserted"" island!!"	2006-12-11	9	4	5

Superb quality and like so many other reviewers, it is so nice to see Gilligan's Island in top quality.The documentaries and thought behind the show are really good too and sure to satisfy many of us who wonder how things really develop.  Outstanding!So, why the 3 stars rating?  First, the &quot;patent-pending&quot; plastic case is POOR -- TOO DIFFICULT to remove the double-sided disks!!!  Come on producers, give us cases that children (and adults) can open and access without tearing up the disks or getting fingerprints all over them.  Some persons like the double-sided disks but I do not.  PLEASE, single-sided disks-- double-sided are almost impossible to handle.In any case, a great set with a REASONABLE price for a change.

The Howell's are a nice shot at the rich and venial. The captain shows a great knowledge of the local area plus he is very superstitious which leads to some funny scenarios.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A2TOU0N8XE68W4	Simon Davis	"What can I really say about this classic 1960's comedy series that I believe will end up outlasting us all? Loved by successive generations of television watchers, absolutely HATED by the critics both at its premiere and ever since this show has taken on near legendary status among viewers. After 40 years of endless reruns the characters of ""Little Buddy"", Gilligan, the Skipper, Kansas farm girl Mary Ann, sultry movie star Ginger Grant, the Professor, and mega rich Thurston Howell the third and his dizzy wife ""Lovey"" Howell, have become household names that need no introduction. Love it or hate it ,(and this viewer literally grew up with the seven castaways as part of his extended family!) ""Gilligan's Island"", is without a doubt one of televisions greatest success stories despite all the odds being laid up against it becoming that. What a joy it was to find out that Warner Brothers were finally giving this legendary series the proper DVD release it deserves with all the episodes of season one properly restored, reissued in their correct and original black and white photography, unedited, and in pristine condition. This set, the first of hopefully the full three seasons of the series to be released onto DVD is a television buffs delight and is essential in the collection of anyone like myself who loves classic television from the fantastic 1960's.What is so unique about this boxed DVD set of the first season of ""Gilligan's Island"", is that it also contains among a selection of extra features the extremely rare pilot episode of the series that has three different characters on board the ill fated S.S. Minnow instead of Ginger, Mary Ann, and The Professor. This makes viewing this long lost episode most interesting as the pilot until the 1990's was never publically aired on television. This pilot episode also contains all the truly beautiful on location photography done in Hawaii where the pilot was filmed which because of the cast changes when the series got the green light was then never seen. Along with the pilot episode the set contains all 36 episodes of ""Gilligan's Island"", first season in their correct order and at their original unedited length. Of course any fan has their favourite episodes but particular favourites of mine are:Episode 5: ""Wrongway Feldman"", guest starring wonderful character actor Hans Conried as a wacky aviator.Episode 7: ""The Sound of Quacking"", where with food supplies low a duck is found on the island and a debate breaks out about whether to cook it. A dream sequence contained in this episode was actually filmed on the ""Gunsmoke"", set.Episode 8: ""Goodbye Island"", the last episode to use location shooting on a beach when the castaways try to repair the Minnow with some not so permanent glue.Episode 10: ""Waiting for Watubi"", an hilarious episode and a tour de force for Alan Hale as the skipper when he believes he is cursed by an ancient god.Episode 17: ""Little Island, Big Gun"", when a mobster hides out from the law on the island.Episode 30: ""Forget Me Not"", where the Professor tries to cure the Skipper's amnesia with some surprising results.Episode 36: ""A Nose By Any Other Name"",where after a fall Gilligan gets an swollen nose and the Professor pretends to ""operate"", on him to cheer him up about his appearance.Never could ""Gilligan's Island"", be mistaken for Shakespeare but then again it never had to be and it is the great work by the extremely talented cast that makes ""Gilligan's Island"", the TV classic it is today. The amazing chemistry and physical give and take by Alan Hale and Bob Denver as the skipper and first mate Gilligan in their scenes together is one of the great comedy highlights of the show and I still feel this duo have never received the recognition that they so richly deserve as comedy greats. Alan Hale's repeated exasperated looks directly into the camera when he gets hit on the head by a falling coconut or gets whacked in the stomach by a bamboo pole courtesy of an always well meaning Gilligan are always guaranteed to break up this viewer with laughter. Hollywood veterans Jim Backus and Natalie Schafer as Mr. and Mrs. Howell were perfect casting in their roles and were so ideal together that they seemed to ACTUALLY BE the Howells to the extent that it was hard to imagine them ever as anyone else. Tina Louise, despite her mixed feelings about the show and her participation in it, is wonderful as movie star Ginger Grant who was always ready to turn on her obvious charms in the hope of being rescued and was best remembered for always wearing evening gowns throughout the shows run. Finally ""the rest"", (as they were billed on the credits for this first season), Dawn Wells as sweet Mary Ann and Russell Johnson as the brilliant Professor also made memorable characters. Mary Ann became the most popular character during the shows original run (and a dream girl for most young boys growing up in the 1960's like myself!!) , while Russell Johnson an actor I've long admired, tackled what was in a way a quite difficult role as the ""straight man"" to all the eccentric characters around him. The Professor was always the voice of reason on the Island who also created some amazing inventions to help the castaways live in reasonable ""comfort"" on the island during their three year run. His hilarious ""explanations"", of features or occurences on the island delivered in a deadpan style with incredible scientific detail always left the rest of the castaways wondering what on earth he was actually saying and was always a great source of humour on the show and makes the professor an integral character because of his ""seriousness"".I'll always love ""Gilligan's Island"", and viewing these first season episodes in this DVD set is like revisiting old friends as the poor castaways always just missing out on a chance to be rescued usually as a result of some mishap caused by Gilligan were like family during my growing up years. Today I appreciate the series for all the great talent that went into creating these episodes which is most often underappreciated by critics. A series that is still loved 40 years after it originally went to air has something special about it and I strongly recommend ""Gilligan's Island: The Complete First Season"", DVD to all lovers of classic television.

I think it is great that these older shows are being brought back on DVD so we can see all the episodes- and the lack of commercials only makes it sweeter.If you liked the show, I highly recommend getting the DVD.

The whole show including guests who ventured onto the island every once in awhile made for a unique and event filled series.  It would have been nice to let it go for one or two more seasons.  I'm no fan of the double sided cd's either but I've had no problems and the menu's make it easy to remember where you left off.	5.0	A must for those who need something to feel good about:	2010-02-05	5	5	0

Hopefully they will be quick in releasing seasons 2 and 3 and the other two movies not currently available.This set of 3 double sided discs is a great bargin and spacesaver than if it were on 6 single sided discs.Some of the humor is even funnier now than it was when first released. For example, Ginger mentions numerous times that she has a crush on actor Rock Hudson. (If she only knew!)There are some good special features but one drawback. Though the first season episodes originally aired in black and white, I have seen the same first season episodes on TV in really good colorized versions. I was hoping that they would offer colorized versions also but that does not seem likely. Seasons 2 and 3 did air in color though and will certainly buy those too.I am not a major fan of the show but will watch it if it is on. This show is a great comedy and the humor is VERY clean by today's standards.	4.0	Very funny show even funnier now than then.	2004-04-15	20	16	4

The picture and sound are about as clean and crisp as ever and definitely better than I remember seeing on any television viewing. The first season of ""Gilligan's Island"" contains all 37 hilarious episodes filmed in glorious Black & White and they are presented as originally filmed in broadcast order. For ""Gilligan's Island"" fans this set is an absolute steal and the only way to get season one completely uncut and unedited and ready for the whole family to enjoy. The extra features and (unaired pilot) are a welcomed bonus for Gilligan's fans, but we all know that more bonus material exists and it should have been included. I hope that this set is well received by fans of the show, so we can get the remaining seasons on DVD. The only negative comment I have about this set is the use of the dreaded double sided discs instead of single sided discs. Amazon's price is the cheapest I've seen anywhere to purchase this classic series and once you have it you can enjoy ""Gilligan's island"" over and over again. Everyone knows the song.........

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	AXHMUN6GC0WEH	"The Fancy One ""blackprincess"""	"It's kind of sad that it took Russell (The Professor) Johnson's death in January to get me watching this show again, but I never really stopped liking it... I just wasn't watching it. I have been a fan of this show since I was a little kid in the '70s...I would rush home from school and before I settled down to tackle my homework, I would grab a light snack and turn to WPIX in New York City at 4:30 pm to watch Gilligan's Island. How I loved that show!Recently I took the plunge and purchased this classic comedy on DVD. All 98 episodes, plus the rarely seen pilot episode are here in their entirety, with some wonderful extras included. It's interesting to note that the pilot did NOT include Tina Louise, Russell Johnson and Dawn Wells but actors Kit Smythe, John Gabriel and Nancy McCarthy, respectively. The latter three were all recast, with some character retooling, due to the fact that they were not as appealing as main players Bob Denver, Alan Hale, Jr., Jim Backus and Natalie Schafer were with test audiences...good move by Sherwood Schwartz. For what is passing these days for entertainment, this is a welcome change. Good, clean comedy that everyone in the family can enjoy and will make you laugh out loud, especially the Season 1 gems, ""Waiting For Watubi"" and ""Physical Fatness""...simply hilarious. Denver and company turned out to be one of the best and memorable ensemble casts in television history, regardless of what critics and network execs thought of this show. Its longevity and popularity proved those naysayers wrong. If you are a Gilligan fan, then this collection is absolutely a must to own.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A14GNQ9LNNWP9I	TH	I was able to watch this season of Gilligan's Island thanks to Amazon Prime membership and it kept me entertained for 2 weeks.  I enjoyed the chance to revisit the old show and it holds up as carefree entertainment without an agenda.  Sit back and enjoy an episode or 2 for a pleasurable evening. It is in black and white, and does not include the Professor or Marianne in the beginning credits, which changes in the second season (just a little trivia).	5.0	Just like I remember	2013-05-21	0	0	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S	Thomas E. Davis	My children love this series just as much as I did when I was young, yet it has humor for adults, too. The show offers a delightful variety of character types, played by superb comic actors, thrown into fast-paced slapstick situations. There are jokes about academic eggheads (the always-inventive but rather obtuse Professor), movie stars (Ginger, channeling Marilyn Monroe), simple farm folk (Mary Ann, the sweet girl next door), and rich people (the hilarious Mr. and Mrs. Howell). At the center of the action, mixing things up, are a modern Laurel-and-Hardy duo, the bumbling sadsack Gilligan and his longsuffering Skipper.Every episode has different complications: wild animals, hostile natives, personal conflicts, supply shortages, bad weather, visiting eccentrics, each element conspiring to prevent the castaways' escape. Guest stars include well-known character actors like Hans Conreid, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Strother Martin, Don Rickles, Phil Silvers, Larry Storch, and even a young Kurt Russell. There are also witty comments on modern life in microcosm: elections, economics, superstitions, feminism, medicine, materialism, and many others.Three seasons of this classic series as well as several bonus featurettes are packed onto nine double-sided discs for a bargain price. Ths seasons are also available separately (and depending on current Amazon prices and those of Marketplace resellers, buying them individually may be an even better value). There are 99 episodes, the first 37 in black and white, including the rarely-seen pilot; the remainder of the shows are in color. Both sound and picture are perfect, and there are subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. Commentaries for several episodes are provided by creator/producer Sherwood Schwartz.Snap up this great set for hours of family entertainment!	5.0	Wonderful series, excellent value	2008-12-13	12	12	0
B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	AC0BGNIUEOW16	Thomas Malone Chandler	Words cannot describe the profound impact that Gilligan's struggle has had on my psyche. His attempt to love and be loved by his fellow castaways is reminiscent of the existential dilemmas found at the center of the drama of Chekov, Strindberg, and especially, O'Neill. In fact, it is this O'Neillean quality that most comes to the fore in this corpus, with doubling characteristic of &#34;Strange interlude&#34; most striking. Not for the faint of heart (or soul).	5.0	A masterpiece of world cinematic literature	2013-09-03	0	0	0

Most people say they should not have made them double sided instead have 6 disc im about half way on that because yeah it would be eaiser to handle and stuff but it would also be a lot more expensive. There are 36 episodes plus the lost piloit.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	AU2VNN9S2I53T	"Timothy Swan ""disc jockey"""	"Many people who I have known through the years, myself included, have always enjoyed the comical exploits of the classic television sitcom ""Gilligan's Island"". While I was much too young to remember this show during its original run on the CBS network during the 60s, I was always fascinated of being able to watch reruns of this program after school in the afternoons, on the weekends, during holidays and throughout Summer vacation. Sometimes it confused me as to why a black-and-white episode would be shown one day and a color episode would be on the next day. However, there is no denying the universal appeal of this timeless program. Now, all 3 complete seasons of this show have been gathered together into this handy boxed set, containing every single episode of the entire series. The first season was aired in black-and-white, with a total of 36 episodes; seasons 2 and 3 were both in full color, for 62 more half-hours. This brings the total to 98 shows. Creator and producer Sherwood Schwartz was responsible for bringing this show to life. He was able to assemble a first-rate, top-knotch cast together to portray the 7 castaways who are stranded on an uncharted deserted island, somewhere in the South Pacific. This great cast includes Bob Denver as Gilligan, Alan Hale, Jr. as The Skipper, Jim Backus as Thurston Howell III, Natalie Schafer as Mrs. Lovey Howell, Tina Louise as Ginger Grant, Russell Johnson as The Professor and Dawn Wells as Mary Ann. Together, this group must learn how to survive, while managing to still keep alive, in spite of the many hardships that they would eventually have to face each time. Also included in this set is the original, unaired pilot episode that first introduced the world to these zany folks. In this pilot, the Professor was played by John Gabriel; with Kit Smythe as Ginger and Nancy McCarthy as Bunny. While the Professor served the same purpose in the pilot and the series, Ginger was not even a glamorous movie star the first time around; both she and Bunny were secretaries. The series eventually brought the castaways in the way that we have all come to know and appreciate, after all these years. This show ranks as one of the ten best comedies in television history. And now, with this 9-disc DVD set containing all 98 classic episodes together into one complete package, this is the perfect way to relive the great memories of a comedy classic."	5.0	The world's longest three-hour tour!	2009-03-04	15	13	2
B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A2JDWJ9QVUJE39	Tina Ray	This is for family, good clean humor that meets all levels of ages in your family.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A2Q13PHEXGR48Q	T O'Brien	Gilligan's Island The Complete First Season is a must have for fans of the 1960's comedy.  Everything you could want is here.  The 3-disc set includes all 36 episodes from the first season presented in standard black and white.  The episodes look great in black and white rather than that awful color that was inserted into them while on TBS.  The DVD also includes the lost pilot episode with three different cast members alongside Gilligan, the Skipper, and the Howells.  Also on the DVD are tropical tidbits about certain episodes, profiles on how the cast was selected, and a tropical island survival guide.The excellent cast really made this show what it was. Bob Denver as Gilligan, Alan Hale JR as the Skipper, Jim Backus as Thurston Howell III, Natalie Schaefer as Lovie Howell, Tina Louise as Ginger, Russell Johnson as the Professor, and Dawn Wells as Mary Ann made up one of the best ensemble casts in television history.  Fans of this much loved show should run out and buy Gilligan's Island The Complete First Season.  You will not be disappointed!	5.0	A must have for Gilligan fans	2004-02-13	129	110	19

The set features every episode from the first season and the prints are excellent. The unaired PILOT with audio commentary by Sherwood Schwartz is both entertaining and informative. The banter bewteen The Skipper and Gilligan in Two On A Raft is a pure comic gem, especially when they end up back on the island. I found  myself laughing out loud at some the Skipper's reactions to Gilligan's dialogue.I advise anyone who has been a fan of this classic show or is just discovering it for the first time, to add it to your collection.

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A13EPXAJ54YG6G	W. Barrett	I can't wait for this DVD. Sure, it was silly, unrealistic, had somewhat poor scripts and some less than brilliant acting (did you ever watch Star Trek?! at least Gilligan was intentionally funny)...but that's what makes it the classic it is today. This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures that will be hidden away and brought out when no one else is around...now, if they would only release all 116 episodes of The Brady Bunch...let the legacy of Sherwood Schwartz live on!!!	5.0	AHHH....GUILTY PLEASURE!	2004-02-01	1	0	1

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A2E705EM08GE8X	weamdog	Do not buy this box set, buy the individual seasons and save enough money for a tank or two of gas.  I paid $72.99 one day, the next day the price went up to $111 and then not 30 mins later it was $102.  You can buy the 3 individual seasons for $15 all day long.  $45 vs $102 for the same content is a no brainer.BTW, season 2 has two disc 3's and no disc 1.  This has happened to me twice.  Also, Amazon has a super return policy. I received my replacement set before I could get the second set in the mail. So, Warner Bros gets 1 star and Amazon gets 5.	1.0	Rip off	2008-03-19	75	37	38

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A3Q4XAQXKKV6V	William Smith	"There is a lot that can be said for not taking yourself TOO seriously... and that's just about the pinnacle of what this series achieved. Not many other series can have a main character warning other stars about the hazards of attempting to leave an island on a raft (The Professor; Two on a Raft) and barely half a dozen episodes later he is on a different raft attempting the same thing!To be honest I bought this on a sort of ""whim"". A local store was having quite an amazing blow-out of prices on this Season and I couldn't resist. The unaired pilot, 36 episodes, a commentary, for under $20? Yep. I'm there. I of course knew what I was getting, and being honest I must say some of the slap-stick is simply overkill and borders on embarrasement, but if you dig a bit deeper you'll find more than that.The casting is just superb. The chemistry is spot on. The locale is enviable. The humor is honest. The packaging is nice. The quantity is unparalled. There just isn't really much else to say. However, having been spoiled by the Bewitched ""coloring"" of Season One I might have preffered that approach. Now before you vote ""unhelpful"" realize I don't just mean any old ""hack"" color job ala Turner Broadcasting I mean ""Sony"" coloring the way Bewitched was handled, now that would have kicked this up one more star.As it stands, Gilligans Island is a great bargain and one of the better 3 hour tours around.

I wish it was high def but I don't think they filmed with the greatest film back then so considering when it was filmed, it's very good. And it's great to be able to see the original pilot. Of course I can't imagine those actors playing the parts so the people that played the parts are so ingrained in our minds. Lots of fun!	5.0	It's Gilligan's Island. What can I say?

They sure made Gilligan more clutsy in that first episode. Glade they changed that because it would have gotten old fast. It would have been interesting to see Bob Denver play a James Bond'ish type role after seeing him type cast as the incompetent one &#34; Dobie Gilles &#34; and Giligans's Island.	4.0	Chance to see the ones I missed	2014-01-19	0	0	0

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A1D1KQ0CJ4O6O1	Yonaton	The CD's were perfect. Nothing blurred or cheap or recorded poorly or anything like that. Each episode was as clear as the day I saw it on TV so many years ago.The whole set was done well, not cheaply like those PoS $5 DVD's one can get at Walmart, that often have scenes missing or don't play at all or are recorded so horrendously you'd rather be poking a stick in your eye than try to watch the DVD.It sure brought back great memories of times when I was a kid. I knew it was going to be somehow 'different' seeing the show as an adult now, but after just a few episodes, I fell back in to the way I used to feel and the mindset I had when I was young back in the late 60's and early 70's. It also brought along a sort of melancholly for those times and thinking of the actors and actresses as we all grew older and some have died and how I miss them even now (all except Ginger (Tina Louise)...the way she acted after the series ended was Prima Donna going overboard and the epitome of a real azzhat hollywood stuckup on themself actor).Anyway, I'm not very eloquent but I'd recommend this set to one and all. I've only had the set for a month now I guess and I'm ready to watch 'reruns', heh heh, which is the joy of having something you enjoy so much on DVD so you *can* watch it whenever the mood hits.	5.0	Wow!

B0000WN1WW	Gilligan's Island: Season 1	A377QQD38Q5Z5M	Zack Hamacher	No other show makes me laugh like this one. Gilligan's Island is one of the best shows ever! It premiered 50 years ago in 1964 and is still being shown in prime time television. That says they must have done something right! As someone who has been watching Gilligan all my life, I still laugh at each episode, no matter how many times I have seen it. Some criticize it for being silly and its impossible situations but that was part of the shows charm. You could watch Gilligan and not have to think about the plot much while laughing often. Watching Gilligan is like going to a place where anything can happen and when it does, it is always fun. The  cast is great. No other actors would have been the same. Thanks to the cast of Gilligan's Island for making a wonderful show which stands the test of time and entertains people of all generations. Rest in peace Russell Johnson. The professor will be sadly missed.	5.0	Classic Comedy!	2014-01-16	1	1	0
