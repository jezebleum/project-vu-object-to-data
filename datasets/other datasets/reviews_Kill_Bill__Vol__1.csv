B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2TW4CW1BTLCR0	"14-Year-Old ""j7r89320dude7"""	This movie was just about the coolest samurai movie I've seen ever! This movie includes everything you see in a samurai movie: plenty of blood, fighting all the time, and great music!Another great movie made by Quentin Tarantino!Warning: I'm 14 and I would recommend this movie only to people who can endure body parts coming off and buckets of blood.	4.0	Great Action Flick!	2004-08-24	8	3	5
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3LNC6044XSWVN	47FOX	Actually there are two subtitles, full english captioning and just the translated subtitles, the modes are Subtitle Off, Engligh 1, and English 2.And the aspect ratio is actually letterboxed in 2.35:1 instead of the standard PSP widescreen, so I don't know what is being misprepresented. I've heard more people complain that it is in its original widescreen and not formatted to fill the PSP screen (Spider-Man 2 for example actually was cropped from 2.35:1 down to the PSP's screen size).This is a great UMD, it has great looking animated menus, it actually HAS a scene selection menu, and it has extras too, a Making Of video and music videos. Compared to the rest of the UMD pack this disc is a feature packed jewel.	5.0	There are three subtitle modes	2005-05-04	20	17	3
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ARFA31P6NNWUR	"""5u5hi"""	"While I'm no film critic, I found ""Kill Bill"" absolutely clever and brilliant.  It's one of those films that need to be watched several times to ""get"" everything.  Sure, the violence and gore might be a turn off, but the gore for one thing wasn't meant to be realistic.  The gore is simply a parody, meant to be comical.  Note the crazy stream of blood that appears when body parts are cut off.  In this way, the film reminded me of the schizophrenic comics people will sometimes read on the subway trains in Japan.  ""Kill Bill"" is also a highly stylized type of film, kind of like the Hong Kong kung foo style?  I'm not exactly sure though.  Regardless, I found this film a breath of fresh air from the regular Hollywood fare.  Although the film might not exactly seem like a brainteaser, ""Kill Bill"" does have some interesting dialogue - for example, Oren-ishi's schoolgirl bodyguard who ""penetrates"" the unwitting male guest.  Clearly this film is a revenge film, but I'm interested to see what happens in Vol. 2 especially as we begin to realize that the premise for revenge begins to unravel as the ""Bride's"" child is not dead, but actually alive.  Gore and violence aside, I would recommend this film to anyone who is a mature and responsible adult."	5.0	Avant Garde!	2003-11-01	6	3	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1RNLPUDOD5ZNG	A. Banaag	This is one of Tarantino's best!!!!!!!!!!This is the story of *bleep* AKA 'The Bride'. After the massacre at her wedding four years earlier in Texas, The Bride seeks revenge on her ex allies responsible for the murders of 9 innocent people in Texas, including her unborn child, or at least she thinks so.She creates a 'Death List 5', a list containing all the people she has to kill: O-Ren, Vernita Green, Budd, Elle Driver and Bill.The movie starts of with a bang -literally- as The Bride and Vernita Green have a knife fight, and ends in a blood bath.In addition to the great acting, Tarantino managed to capture a 70's-like aspect to this flick, with the catchy and intense music, awesome special effects, humor, and setting.If you loved 'Resivior Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction', you'll absolutley love 'KILL BILL Vol. 1'.	5.0	&quot;Wiggle your big toe.&quot;	2004-07-12	2	0	2

Uma Thurman's portrayal of ""The Bride"" is flawless. During the scene where she wakes up from the hospital bed, you can feel her pain and it literally hurt my heart! This movie is not for everyone. It is not some action flick where you can just zone out and watch explotions. The person I went to see this which left because it was ""too weird and didn't make any sense"". She probably felt this way because the movie proceeds somewhat out of order. I never felt lost, however. The violence in this movie makes any graphic war film look like Mary Poppins, but if you're like me and not really affected by blood then you'll be fine. This is the only movie I have ever been to where the audience applauded at the end. It was well deserved."	5.0	Phenomenal	2003-10-11	3	2	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A20XFUO582WJZ3	"A. Breitweg ""wuxia84"""	Honestly after seeing this movie I wanted to kill Bill and the rest of the cast, basically everyone involved in creating this movie. I felt like I wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this. The martial arts sequences are unrealistic. As much as I like Uma Thurman and David Carradine they could not bring the movie to a decent watchable standard. As much as I, being a woman, like the idea of women warriors, at least have the woman doing actual martial arts, and getting it right. Since when does Chinese Wushu involve a khatana or Samarai sword? I guessI thought somehow this would have some sort of redeeming quality. It may be a good movie if you enjoy severed limbs and fake blood, but to cloak it under any sort of martial arts is degrading to the art itself. The second movie was a little better plot wise, but still not worth the money it costs to rent or watch it at the theater. Go watch a Jet Li or Jackie Chan if you like martial arts, don't waste your time on this.If you are a fan of Tarantino this is the movie for you, it follows in the same vein as his other movies.IE Pulp Fiction, Resevoir dogs, ect. It may be watchable for the cimematic quality, or the dry spagetthi western humor. But if you are a martial arts purist, don't see this it will only disappoint.	1.0	Kill Bill (and the entire cast and crew that made this film)	2004-11-27	22	4	18
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A288U2D5LA45XV	abunaiyo	"First off, I do realize that this is simply entertainment, but my gut reaction to the rampant violence and gore was repulsion.  The glorification and ""coolness"" of vengeance and killing is disturbing, to say the least.  There is already too much vengeange-fueled terrorism and violence going on in the real world; as a result, I was unable to celebrate with Thurman's character as she systematically dispatched her foes.I enjoy watching martial art movies, such as ""Hero"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" because the carefully crafted fight sequences help to propel and illustrate the well written story.  That was not the case with ""Kill Bill"", where the fighting was the major focus, and the story was secondary.  What was the relationship between the sword maker Hattori and his disgruntled apprentice?  How did the bride (Thurman) achieve her level of fighting expertise?  These are but a few of the things that could have helped with the plot and character development.I agree with the other reviewers who expressed surprise at the number of rave reviews by professional critics.  Tarantino may be paying homage to his favorite directors, but I still can't understand how he has become so well respected and revered.One last thing:  for those of you who know who Uma Thurman's father is, I wonder what he think's of his daughter's choice of acting roles, especially in the ""Kill Bill"" series."	2.0	Glorification of senseless violence	2005-01-11	12	6	6
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3DGB4HN3QCGAL	A. Burchfield	With all the big buzz on Kill Bill I expected to see a good movie, I was really disappointed.Set in chapters, the first thing you see is a fight to the death between the &quot;Bride&quot;, Uma Thurman, and one of the people who failed to kill her- Viveca Fox. This was one of the best parts of the movie, one of the best fights too.After this the story actually goes into a long flashback to inform you as to what's going on, some of that is all right. You'll see some of it in B/W, Lucy Liu's character's childhood is done in Japanese Anime (Japanese style action cartoon). A lot of the movie reminds me of the anime stuff I've seen with it's styling, a bit too much of it as far as I'm concerned and endless plot holes to go with it.Much of the movie concerns Thurman tracking down Liu to kill her this culminates in a big Samurai sword fight between Thurman and Liu's Yakuza gang. Lot's of lost feet, hands, arms, legs probably even a few heads with a ridiculous amount of spraying blood (most of the battle is in B/W). I was pretty well turned off by the movie and don't recommend it.Uma Thurman and Viveca Fox might be better than this, I know Lucy Liu certainly can beat it.	2.0	Very disappointed in this one	2004-06-10	5	2	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1LBAC84TLIGAX	"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF"""	Kill Bill is one of the best movies I have ever watched in my entire life as a gamer and a movie lover. The story is basically about a woman named Beatrix Kiddo who is out to kill her former boss and his four assassins who put a hit out on her when she left Bill and nine innocent people were killed, along with her own daughter(or so she believes). In this movie she kills two of the assassins by tracking them down and slaughtering them with her katana made by one of Bill's sensais.  The storyline of this movie is good, the action is awesome, the gore is overly splatterful, and the movie is humorous at times. Plus, I actually learned some Japanese words and phrases from this movie. If you love Quentin Tarantino movies, you'll love this astonishing masterpiece.	5.0	EXCELLENT!

I have never in my LIFE seen someone make a sandwich with such ease - or have a more carefully laid out assortment of sandwich fixins'. You KNOW what I'm talkin' `bout!It brought a tear to my eye.  In terms of effortless, graceful, mayo spreading and sandwich making, it stands as one of the greatest scenes ever.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3HWXY0IMXOBFB	Adam Dustin	"Quentin Tarantino has achieved something that his good buddy Robert Rodriguez hasn't, the ability to escape from the shadow of his breakout film.  While Rodriguez soared in ""El Mariachi,"" he has fallen short in both sequels, ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" being the latest failed attempt to come up with something new and fresh.  ""Kill Bill:Volume One"" is proof that Tarantino will not follow in his friends footsteps.  Coming off of the stale ""Jackie Brown"" (The third film by Tarantino) six years later Tarantino achieves a movie that hooks its claws into you from start to finish in a way ""Pulp Fiction"" did back in the early nineties.  Tarantino uses his library of movie knowledge to bring to life a purposefully lame plot about a former female assassin who wants out and is left for dead, as a result she wants revenge against ""Bill"", the leader of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad she used to be a part of.  Known only as ""The Bride"", Uma Thurman plays the role masterfully with little seriousness for her situation, but with a fun trot for the epic of different genres (Such as old kung fu, japanese animation and spaghetti westerns), and cranberry blood that flies around the room with every severed arm, leg, foot and head.  Yes, this isn't a film that has a moral message, and it's not supposed to, what it does is convey Tarantino's genius and understanding of film and film's potential for artistical mastery.  Kill Bill was snubbed at the Oscars and probably because of the violence, but the violence is not taken seriously by Tarantino, and it shouldn't by the viewer either.  Kill Bill was the best film of the year, and if ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" comes anywhere close to the creative masterpiece created by Tarantino, the Oscars may have to rethink there decisions from this year.  Whether you like ""Kill Bill"" or not, you must understand its mastery of film, and the genius of the modern Orson Welles, Quentin Tarantino.  This film is a triumph of art!!!"	5.0	The Best Film of 2003!!!!!!	2004-02-12	7	4	3
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A18BD98SU49UB7	"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H."""	"Kill Bill is the Brain child of a person who realizes that in film, there are no rules. Let me re-phrase that, there are no rules that Mr. Tarantino cannot break.In this world, anything is possible within reason. For example: The heroine must be able to carry her sword from Okinawa to Tokyo on a commercial aircraft - No problem. Rather than giving in to the desired urge most director's would concur to create some sort of secret mode of travel: Tarantino says, ""Lets make the entire population carry samurai swords."" Moments like these make me want to shout, ""Lord, there ARE directors who break tradition! Thank you! Finally someone unwilling to conform!""Kill Bill is splashed with stylized visuals, with its very own type of violence. Blood, with more blood, but squirting with the strength of a firehose at 200 psi. After this film and the Evil Dead's I have learned a great fact: It's ok to make people laugh amid the brew of violent stew. Tell me you can watch a groovy fight scene with the ""Crazy 88's"" that embody's the entire last half of Bill, and not grin with delight.The story is simple, yet unpredictable. During the wedding of the main character (shown briefly in a animated sequence) an unnamed Uma Therman (Going so far as to BLEEP out the name to keep her identity hidden) is beaten up, and shot in the head. Her entire wedding party is slaughtered, ""even the minister and old organ player!"" Somehow she survives, and remains in a coma for four years. When she awakens, she comes to realize many horrible thing's, the worst of which that her daughter, which was still in the womb, was also dead. Thus, the revenge begins.Kill Bill is something that should be seen on the big screen. I rarely go out on a limb like this, being the owner of 200 plus dvd's and hardcore advocate of home entertainment, but this is a MUST for the big screen. No doubt, unless you have the projector setup and a sweet sound system with a good woofer, you will kick yourself in the head for not seeing it in large scope. Loved this movie. 5 out of 5 for the film that takes chances and willingly breaks the rules to make its own...Death to being chagrined!"	5.0	Silly Rabbit, and many other reasons why this film is cool.	2003-11-04	7	4	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1J2XS96HSQCER	"A. D. ""Aranis"""	As I prepared to watch this movie, my expectations were high  because a friend of mine had told me how awesome it was.  It failed to meet most of those expectations.  I expected it to be original, and, my gosh, did it deliver on that.  The music was an incredible mix of about 6-7 different genres, and, somehow, it worked.  The whole sense of style of the movie screamed &quot;original&quot; throughout.  What was disappointing, however, was the fighting, which was the focus of the movie.  The first fight was far too short in my opinion, and the ending was not cool in the slightest. The second fight scene with the Yakuza gang just seemed like a big excuse to spray blood.  That practice became tiresome quickly.  Then the last fight of the film wasted the potential it had.  It started off playing some really cool music, and the two warrior women were evenly matched, trading blows and the then-energy-filled fight looked it would reach a great climax. Surprise, surprise, though, Beatrix's back is slashed, the music stops and a minute later O'ren no longer has her scalp.  Lastly, in case you were wondering, the inane plot is only there the give some reason for all the violence and blood, which I thought was excessive.  This would be strictly 1-star material if the movie didn't have so much originality.	2.0	In a word: disappointing	2004-05-04	14	0	14

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ADLVFFE4VBT8	"A. Dent ""Aragorn"""	I want to make it VERY clear, the three stars are NOT for the movie. Kill Bill, in my view, is one of the best movies ever made but this evaluation is for THIS Kill Bill Blu-ray release.I am totally sold on Blu and, when the Kill Bill bundle became available... well... I ordered it when Amazon offered it at a great discount. The bundle includes Kill Bill 1 and 2 and, IF you wish to upgrade your KBs I highly recommend the bundle because you could save a few dollars. There is no difference between the 2 KBs sold as individual titles and them sold together other than, possibly, the price.I wish I had a lot to say about the Blu-ray version but I don't so, let me say what is worth saying:- The contents of the Blu-ray version are EXACTLY those of the DVD edition, nothing more, nothing less.- Even the artwork is borrowed from the original DVD edition.- The 'extras' are shot in low resolution, in fact they are the exact extras you will find on the DVD.- The resolution of the movie is, of course, higher than the DVD's and the audio is available as 'uncompressed' but nothing special was done for the Blu issue. I noticed quite a few artifacts and some graininess but, overall, the picture quality is good. It could have been a lot better. I expect a remastered edition in the near future.Overall, I am not very happy with this edition which appears to have been put together on the cheap and in a hurry. I suspect that the digital master used to make the DVDs was quickly converted to Blu and thrown out on the market but I could be wrong.I am looking forward to a complete and professionally done Tarantino filmography on Blu in the near future, meaning that I'd be buying the Kill Bills three times.On deciding whether to buy this release or not it should be up to one's budget. Those who don't have the DVD edition but have a Blu player, definitely buy the Blu, preferably the bundle because one never knows when a superior version may be released. If you already have the DVD... like I said, I bought my KB 1&2 package when Amazon offered it at a very significant discount.	3.0	Not a Great Release, by Blu Standards	2008-11-11	131	108	23

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2Z5RFU4DH3T0G	"A. Fondacaro ""NiaTonyF"""	Quentin Tarantino had already mastered the art of directing by &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and in &quot;Kill Bill&quot; he continues his normal stride of shots and scene-crafting that seems to emanate from a natural talent and cool confidence of someone who was born to do what he does.First the good news; &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is a good movie, highly watchable, enjoyable, and is thoroughly &quot;Tarantinian&quot; in style and mojo.  With Tarantino it's always the little highlights that get all the attention (such as when a character is knocked over, and the sound of bowling pins being knocked down is edited into the track).Also with Tarantino is the evanescence of geekiness.  There have been works written about the homages to Japanimation or &quot;Anime&quot; films that Tarantino seems to cherish, such as &quot;the sound of the sword slash was borrowed from such-and-such film,&quot; and &quot;the style of attack used by &quot;The Bride&quot; is reminiscent of such-and-such&quot; and on and on.  I'm not interested by anime, nor does Tarantino's fascination with it excite me.  It's merely there, and I accept it.The bad news: the film is horrifically violent.  Blood is everywhere, people with limbs chopped off writhe on the ground in pain, children are present at the murder of their parents.  This is a cruel movie made by a film geek who views film as a vessel for flight from a certain &quot;decency.&quot;  While I am against censorship in any form, I am for good taste (such concepts get confused these days).  I don't think Tarantino exercises good taste with some of his decisions, especially utilizing the style of anime, which is an inherently violent genre.  For example, part of the film is actually anime, and yet there is no separation of reality from the footage of real actors and the footage of cartoons.  Blood spurts from wounds like an opened firehose in both cases, which is neither in good taste, nor is it appealing.  There is no significance to such mass quantities of blood or suffering, it's merely an allusion to anime.All that gore is really in place to glorify cruelty, and the use of an assassin as the main plot-mover is evidence of this.  More evidence is the list she keeps of all the people who have wronged her, and she crosses them off one-by-one as she eliminates them.  Basically, there is no other recourse in this reality except complete retribution, therefore no mercy or compassion.  The movie is about cruelty, and it paints cruelty in an extremely shining light.After a while, the blood and suffering because boring, and you wish that Thurman's character would simply Kill Bill and have it done with.The idea of not revealing Thurman's character's name (simply referring to her as &quot;The Bride&quot;) is not a new idea in film, nor is it really necessary here.  Tarantino has no intention about making a point of namelessness in the realm of assassination, and &quot;Fight Club&quot; is the only movie that comes to mind that has pulled off the nameless-character bit with success.  Reason: I don't care if I know The Bride's name or not.I'm sure opinions will change once I see &quot;Kill Bill 2,&quot; but I'm only anticipating more violence, more amplified gore, and more of Tarantino's anime-flavored dialogue which is so out of his realm that the usual giddiness of hearing the F-word thrown out in rapid-fire succession doesn't crop up.	3.0	Overly violent, theatrically masterful	2004-05-05	3	2	1

Yes, it is a very violent revenge movie, but oddly it is a comedy, part comic book, part Japanese Yakuza hidden dragon crouching dragon scenes.

With Tarantino, you never know what is going to happen.  Everyone really liked it.  With the exception of the large cell phones, it is not dated at all.  It has a great cast.  Lucy Lui as ""O-Ren Ishii"" a part japanese, part chinese american, is fantastic.  Uma Thurman as ""the bride"" is great.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1AUOVXPT5MYX4	"A. Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx"""	From the first 30 seconds the movie started I knew it was going to blow me away. There are exciting sequences throughout, and while the film is extremely violent, it is also cartoonish violence and the visuals are eye-popping and dazzling. Uma Thurman makes a great heroine, and I disagree with a previous review that said that Thurman does not make her character sympathetic. I think the audience will root for her to get her revenge, yet there are moments in the film where you realize the kind of life she is living (and has led in the past) and there are moments of vulnerability displayed by Thurman's character.I am a comic book fan, and anime fan, a video gamer and love great music.and I thought I have seen/read any possible scenario imaginable! So, my advice: If you liked either From Dusk Til Dawn, Pulp Fiction, Desperado, or Reservoir Dogs, see this. It pleases. And if you haven't liked Tarantino's past stuff, DON'T SEE IT. He doesn't do anything revolutionary to change his ways(why I gave it 4 and not 5 - he does really stick with his old formula), and you will still not be enamored.	4.0	The action is furious!	2007-03-19	2	2	0

During her time in the coma ward The Bride is repeatedly raped by a filthy orderly called Budd.  Boy does he have it comming when she awakens...Seeking revenge, she visits the first assasin and dispaches her quickly. The Bride then travels to Okinawa and pays a visit to Bill's former Samuri teacher and asks him to create a sword for her. He declines first but soon gives in when The Bride tells him who it will be used on.In this first movie she takes on Luci Liu in a spectacular hack and chop sword fight involving the Yakuza crime syndicate.  As usual Tranatino's humor is exposed during this and you get to have some funny laughs as all this bloody killing is going on.The movie ends with the demise of Liu and the promise of more revenge in Volume 2.Using ironic music, Tarantino style, and the use of Japanese cartoons to explain Luci Liu's character is typically cleaver.All round a really good movie worthy of five stars.	5.0	Playing with knives!! - Nice Truck!	2004-04-22	2	1	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3AV9MQ8SUE6PF	"a.k.a. ""Lost Inner Space"""	This movie should not work. It has a razor thin plot, no real character development, no redeeming message, and hardly a line of substantial dialogue. It is pure melodrama, and pure ingenious filmmaking. I thought the title was  gratuitous, and was not looking forward to yet another violent movie. I  wanted to hate it but I loved the cinematic references and the nostalgiac homages. It is not merely violent, it is a mockery of violence. Nothing of what happens feels real, and the viewer begins to question why the banal concept of reality should even be expected in such an artificial artform such as Filmmaking. It is funny and engaging on different levels. Tarantino has made another Cult Classic. If you are a fan of Hong Kong martial arts movies, Italian westerns, Japanese samurai movies and Anime, the low-budget Action flick, and 70's TV, then you need to see this! It is a real Postmodern work of Art. Now I'm hooked and I need to see Volume Two....Damn!	4.0	TARANTINO-Master of Retro-Cool	2004-05-31	2	2	0

Tarantion also revives Uma Thurman's career, as she gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the revenge driven bride on a mission to settle the score.

It's not everyday that you see a movie that can make you grovel at its heels. From start to finish Kill Bill is amazing at all angles. The beginning lets you know your in for a fun ride. If you are a martial arts fan like me, you know that Kill Bill succeeds in the art of keeping your mouth open. The character of the bride is the most interesting of the whole film. You think to yourself, this woman has been totally screwed over. She deserves her revenge. And who better to play the part than Uma Thurman. Uma captured the fury in the Bride's eyes as she fought her enemies to complete her ultimate victory. Kill Bill also exceeds in putting together a brilliant cast, starring the madness of Lucy Liu, the foxyness of Vivica A. Fox, The coolness of Michael Madsen, the wickedness of Daryl Hannah, and the mysteriousness of David Carradine. Not to mention a incredible soundtrack. Quentin Tarantino is truly the master when it comes to putting together a great movie. If you have any questions about the movie, let me know.	5.0	A Masterpiece	2004-06-11	2	0	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3C6X0DAM87GN4	Alex Udvary	"Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" was definitely one of the most eagerly awaited films of the year or should I say of the past 6 years. In his ""come back"" film, his last piece of work was ""Jackie Brown (1997)"" Tarantino delievers the goods. His fans will be pleased. I've seen all of his films (not like that was a hard thing to do since he's only directed 3) and all 3 have entertained me. I like his off-the-wall style of film-making. He seems to be a ""real"" movie lover. I don't feel he makes movies just for money. I honestly get the feeling Tarantino does it because he truly loves the idea of telling you a story.As I understand it Tarantino is paying tribute to Hong Kong action movies, I'm guessing along the lines of Bruce Lee movies. I'm not familiar with those movies at all. In fact I've never seen one in my life. But as I watched ""Kill Bill"" another movie came to mind. A Francois Truaffut film (something I'm a bit more familiar with) entitled ""The Bride Wore Black"". It was one of Trauffaut's Hitchcock like films about a a group of assassins who shoot a woman's husband on the day of their wedding. Years later the wife makes a list of the men who committed the crime and goes after them one by one. ""Kill Bill"" is playing around with the same story. Now I don't know if Tarantino knows about this movie. I don't know if Tarantino even likes Truffaut or has even heard of him. Maybe the story-line to ""Kill Bill"" is typical of Hong Kong movies. But the one advantage (?) ""Kill Bill"" has over ""The Bride Wore Black"" is Tarantino treates the subject in a more tongue and cheek manner. Tarantino knows there's not much of a story here but the movie gets by on its incredible action scenes and the presence of Uma Thurman. Who deserves an Oscar nomination. I'm not sure if she'd get one though because the Academy may think the movie does not deserve to be taken ""seriously"" which would be a major mistake on their part. Thurman deliver a tour-de-four performance!If you've enjoyed Tarantino's past works, ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Resevoir Dogs"" & ""Jackie Brown"" you're gonna love this movie. I will say this though, ""Kill Bill"" is one of the most violent movies I have ever seen. I think it might be Tarantino's most violent. So, if you really have a ""weak stomach"" I wouldn't suggest you see this. Then again, going into this movie you should expect gore. It is a Tarantino film and it is called ""KILL Bill"". So keep that in mind before you start to bash the movie and say you don't like it because of the violence. Its there, I know, I cann see, but ""Kill Bill"" is still an amazing film. It's one of the year's best!Bottom-line: Quentin Tarantino is back with a bang! After a 6 year break he comes back with a film that is typical of his unusual and totaly ""his own"" style of film-making. One of the year's best. Fans will love it."	4.0	"One ""Killer"" Movie!"	2003-10-14	3	0	3
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2LMZKN2UBSH9R	alex whitman	I think kill bill vol. 1 is a great movie.  Uma Thurman is great as the bride, as she displays a great amount of ferocity and determination and delivers great fight scenes.  The casting is phenomenal with Lucy Lui and Vivica A. Fox portraying equally fierce women.  The little dialogue in the movie is quick, sharp, and witty.  The only part of the movie I didn't like was the animation scene, it seemed really unnecessary and it was slightly confusing.  If you like action flicks that don't take themselves too seriously I would definitely recommend Kill Bill.  However, if violence isn't your cup of tea, you should definitely skip this movie.	5.0	Beautiful action flick	2004-08-13	4	2	2

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A36X592GCMYP8M	"Amazon Customer ""aj_brown"""	"I find the Kill Bill series at once artfully and skillfully made and horrifically violent.  I like action movies, suspense movies, and movies with strong female leads, so I thought I might like these.  I was wrong.  I hated these films.  The relentless, over-the-top violence and gore was mind-numbing and repugnant to me.  If anything, these films are proof that an NC-17 rating will never be given for violence.No one can argue that these films are not well-made, creatively plotted and presented, and painstakingly choreographed.  But the violence is far greater than I was prepared for in a film that wins such praise.  Some argue that the violence is so extreme that it can be thought of as ""cartoonish"" and therefore not problematic in the way that watching, say, only a tenth as many blood-spurting murders would be.  But be warned:  Kill Bill careens from brutality to brutality.  Technical skill serves up savagery.Whether the art makes the splattered blood less soul-searing and more uplifting is a decision you have to make.  I found myself deeply disturbed during the films and long afterward. Caveat emptor.  Although these films have received extremely positive reviews, they are only for those who, for better or worse, can be numb to scores of brutal hand-to-hand murders portrayed on screen."	1.0	Art, mayhem, vision, and violence: Know what you're getting	2005-08-02	27	11	16
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3LUUF8CAWLPHX	"Amazon Customer ""bluejaye"""	In the opening credits of Kill Bill, it is announced that this is the fourth film by Quentin Tarantino... or at least half of the fourth film. After such a self-indulging credit, I guess an overwhelmingly self-indulgent film should have been expected. Tarantino so completely overstuffs Kill Bill with extraneousness as to leave nothing non-extraneous. It becomes a masterpiece of excess, in which every single scene probably should have been cut. The cinematography stands out as jerky and under-whelming, with only the cartoon colors to give it pizzazz. The editing is choppier than the old Kung Fu movies Kill Bill is attempting to emulate. The Kung Fu itself is paced and boring. Only Go Go Yubari (played by Chiaki Kuriyama) with her ball and chain is able to liven up an overlong bloodbath with a little teen-inspired angst. One might say Tarantino missed the story for the action... but the problem with that criticism is character. Without character, there is no action, and Uma Thurman's 'The Bride' is not character.So, The Bride wants to kill Bill (the big boss) and all of Bill's henchman as revenge for trying to kill her and killing her husband and her baby. The rest of the movie, and presumably volume two as well, consists of her tracking down the henchman, and ultimately Bill, and killing them in long boring gory fight scenes. For some reason, Tarantino decided to tell it all out of order, thinking that like in Pulp Fiction it might make things more exciting. All it does is contribute to the fact that it doesn't matter when or how you dole out information if everybody already knows what's going to happen. Before being killed, each member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad gets a cinematic introduction (the best of which is the animated O-Ren Ishii scene). A few overwhelmingly stupid scenes, including a sex craving hospital attendant that prostitutes out coma victims (The Bride being one of them) make the already over-long movie over-longer. Overall, the only thing remarkable to be seen here is how Tarantino was able to lay such an expository piece of dreck over such a thin narrative skeleton. The result is less than watching those classic Kung Fu movies on shuffle in a five disc DVD player. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Tarantino can, he did, and he shouldn't have.	1.0	Pure Adulterated Cinema	2003-11-28	64	28	36

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AZNCDOLHNG9GO	"Amazon Customer ""dora"""	Now, I must first state what Kill Bill vol. 1 is NOT before I can continue with this review.  If you expect it to be any of these things, you will be disappoined and likely thoroughly hate the movie.It is not deep and thought-provoking.  It is not family friendly.  It is not meant to be taken seriously.  It is not a movie wherein the violence is justified.That done, I will tell you what it IS, and why I rated it so highly.  It is one of the best homage/parodies of Hong Kong action flicks I have ever seen.  If you are even passingly familiar with HK action movies (particularly the martial arts ones from the '70s), it's easy to see how this movie was so heavily influenced by them.  It has some of the most amusingly orchestrated violence I have seen.  When someone's limb is cut off and the blood gushes twenty feet in the air, it's very hard to take the violence TOO seriously, but at the same time the fights are beautifully choreographed.I must state again that this isn't really a movie to be taken seriously.  When you see a shot of Tokyo's international airport and almost EVERYONE has a katana strapped to their belts, that's a pretty good sign that this movie is all in good (mindlessly bloody and amusing) fun.(As a side note, this DVD has one of the most interesting and well-executed menus I've seen.

The special effects is a mix of low budget mediocrity and some well made shots. However, the merit of the movie falls into mediocrity.

The shocker of the movie is the ending.... a unapologetic and blatant sucker punch to lead you into the second part (sequel).I will agree with another reviewer in that it a great movie if you like to see women/girls duke it out with each other. What does that say about the movie audience can be summed up into one word.... juvenile.It a shame such actors in this movie have reduced themselves into staring in such schlock.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A5S3BAWLNT10P	Amazon Customer	"""Kill Bill"" looks like a tongue in cheek Valentine's Day card to a whole range of sensationalistic and schlocky movies. There are homages to Blaxploitation movies, to Chinese kung fu and swordplay films, to samurai films, and to Japanese manga (or animation).The story doesn't seem all that important. It's certainly not complicated. On her wedding day a pregnant woman initially known as the Bride and later known as ""Black Mamba"" (played by Uma Thurman) is shot and left for dead by a group of assassins from the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad headed by Bill (David Carradine). After she awakens from a coma she resolves to get revenge on Bill and the assassins.From that moment on ""Kill Bill"" is a simple revenge movie, of the kind that dominated Shaw Brothers output in the seventies. It's also an exercise in style that both admires and sends up the movies its based on.Among the evil characters Black Mamba is coming up against a O-Ren Ishii/Cottonmouth (played by Lucy Liu), Elle Driver also known as California Mountain Snake (played by Daryl Hannah), Michael Madsen as Budd or Sidewinder, and Viveca A Fox as Vernita Green aka Copperhead.We can't know what Tarantino's entire plan is until we see part two, but part one does show Tarantino at the peak of ihis craft. He manages to veer from tension to violence to humour from sequence to sequence. But to laugh, you need to be willing to take cartoon-like violence (quite literally in a cartoon at one point) and buckets and buckets of blood. There are also a lot of dismembered body parts flying around the screen. When heads get chopped off, blood spurts 10 feet up into the air like a fountain, in a completely unrealistic way.Overall the movie is a masterful exercise in style, and a very knowing one. We're invited to stand back and look at it almost as an essay in the movies its quoting. In that sense it's almost like a Godard film.Tarantino's much helped in all this by cinematographer Robert Richardson, who also shot Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers"". Like Natural Born Killers, this one uses a lot of different techniques and looks, as well as some stunning camera movements. As it's a homage to 1970's exploitation movies the music on the soundtrack is mostly cheesy 1970's stuff.But my main reservation about Tarantino, at least on the basis of his first two films., comes to the fore again. He's great at style, he's great at coolness, but he's really not so hot on presenting emotion or characters we can care about. Even the horrors that lead to the whole revenge scenario are underplayed stylistically, chopped up and rearranged so we're not too involved in them. That's one thing that's NOT like the movies he's quoting, where the original action that starts that course of revenge is usually shown graphically enough to tie our stomachs in knots and encourage us to root for the main characters.Yuen Wo-ping is credited as Martial Arts Advisor rather than Martial Arts Choreographer, and I think there's a good reason for that. Often during action scenes on this kind of movie you feel that the director has taken a break while the martial arts guys do their stuff. Here, as on ""Crouching Tiger"" you feel that the director's maintained a lot of control over the fight scenes. Even in the fights, this is still a Quentin Tarantino movie. And what fights they are. Watching Kill Bill I realised that I often complain about the fights in Hong Kong movies going on so long you look at your watch. Here the fights go on even longer, and yet they are so clearly filmed, broken up so effectively by different filming techniques and location changes,that - for me at any rate - they never did seem too long.I don't know how deep it's all going to turn out to be. But still I loved part one and can't wait for part two. It's terrific cinematic fun as you watch it, but it remains to be seen whether it's ultimately going to be movie fast food or a more satisfying meal."	5.0	Style more than content	2004-02-28	1	0	1

QT's dark sense of humor kept me rolling on the floor and the cinematic displays are awe-inspiring. It works this way: if you like Quentin Terrantino, you'll like Kill Bill. If you don't, you won't.I would recommend, regardless of my high opinion of this movie, that if you can hold out for the purchase, then do so. Since Kill Bill volumes one and two are actually one movie (not a movie and a sequel), I've a strong feeling that after volume 2 is released, you'll be able to purchase the whole movie as a set. So hang in there if you can - volume two ought to be out on DVD right quick.	4.0	Fantastic, but don't buy it!	2004-05-10	6	5	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3TNM3C9ENUCFW	"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster"""	From the opening credits this film is more launched than introduced to the audience and doesn't really let up until the last tantalizing (go the the sequel) scene. Like the incredibly succesful Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Kill Bill was filmed all in one go, and originally intended as a single movie, (which would probably have been overlong).Being cleverly split into two volumes,the film flows incredibly well with solid continuity, but even more cleverly is the short 4 month gap between Vol 1 on DVD and the Vol 2 in theaters idea, to keep the film fresh, and the fans interested. It's difficult to use words like &quot;classic&quot; when describing Tarantino, but love him or hate him, you have to admire this piece of work which is certainly on a par with Pulp Fiction. One wonders whether the bankability of Tarantino's name is enough to draw an audience alone regardless of the material, without the added bonus of the viewer almost knowing what to expect before they walk into the movie theater. This must surely gives him the luxury of a virtually free hand in the creativity of the plot, characters, and the action, in fairly safe comfort of the knowledge that the picture will be well received. Kill Bill is a simple revenge story, and a pastiche homage to a slew of film genres, most notably the dubbed Kung Fu action movies of the 70's. From the cheesy Raymond Chow style movie credits to the breathtaking choreography, many in the know have even recognised the juxtaposition of individual scenes, from previous Chinese classics. The film is gloriously over the top, but not overacted. There is a strange reassurance to the strength of the lead performances, playing with such dead pan sincerity, amidst even the most farcical elements of the film, and the end result is a real treat. As usual the movie is littered with expletives, and whereas the violence content button seems to have gone into overdrive, the almost astral exaggeration of the fight and blood letting sequences, actually re-emphasise the fantasy of it all. It is extremely doubtful that this film would have had much success, or even exposure without Tarantinos credentials, but as it is, it's a great experience for fans and newcomers alike - sure to be a hit with Vol 2 already in Theaters.	4.0	Doesn't Stop to take a Breath!	2004-04-22	4	3	1

These elements are blended together to make a very unique picture.The Bad Things*The extreme violence scared me away at first (but once you're used to it, it's all quite fun).*Some disturbing parts (but this can be a good thing, because it makes the film edgy).*Some absurd, unrealistic parts (but this can be a good thing too, because it makes the film stylish and fun).Despite being one of the bloodiest movies I know, it has become one of my all-time favorites.  The style of it is smashing; even when there is no action, the movie is very immersive.  I've come to appreciate the characters and the story, in addition to the vivid style.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A928WN8NV03WZ	"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy"""	Quentin Tarrantino is finally back with a bang and a splatter.  Showing his roots finally with a two part homage to Asian cinema.  Little bit of history about the director, when he dropped out of high school, he spent a lot of his free time watching asian cinema at a theater near his home.  This movie is broken into compartments, this movie has the samurai japanese style, the animae segment, and a piece that is similar to 70's style low budget action flicks.  It is gorier than any more he has done, and any movie that was mainstream for that year, but still a lot of fun.The action sequences were superbly filmed and shown with not only in a style similar to old asian style cinema but a great deal of respect.  The characters were well acted and had a three dimensional feel to them.  Tarrantino's obsession with the 70's shows all around, look at the cereal that Vivica A Fox's character is holding.  It also contains the patented Tarrantino humor, offbeat, twisted, and just a little nerdy.Uma Thurman shows her fans that she isn't just a wilting flower, she is a powerful figure in this movie.  A former bride that is out for revenge.  She is driven to avenge the deaths of her child and husband.  It shows in the limited interactions she has with her prey.  She respects them for their abilites, and nothing else.  Nothing will stop her from her goals, even when one of her prey has reformed, it doesn't matter, she is going to die.  Fans will love her in this, she is tough, smart, and deadly, playing the anti hero role perfectly.Kung fu and samurai fans will be pleased with this movie.  From the bloody and well choreographed fight sequence/knife fight, to the samurai showdown at the end of the movie.  They even do the blood and dismemberment similar to japanese samurai movies.  Though this isn't a Jacki Chan movie, half the budget was probably spent on blood and dismembered body parts.The villians are an interesting lot.  All of them have their quirks, but they are still villians.  There is the bloodthirsty Elle Driver, fabulously played by Daryl Hannah.  Vernita Green, the former killer trying to reform.  Budd, the haunted former assasin played well by Michael Madsen.  The icy O-Ren Ishii, a sociopath written practically for Lucy Liu.  As well as the enigmatic Bill, voiced by David Carradine.The only real bad part of this movie was is the plot was a bit simplistic.  But if you look at it how it was intended, it wasn't a bad thing. This was a visual film, intended to showing you what was going on rather than telling you.  Too many plot elements would have slowed down the pace, and made it seem like a longer movie.  Make no mistake, this is an action movie, flat out.  You are supposed to buckle in and enjoy the ride.Five stars for a polished and quality action flick.  Hopefully Tarrantino's next movie will show this same sort of progression.	5.0	Not your typical action hero/Not for the faint of heart	2004-06-21	1	0	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AIP5AVN8RBZNW	A. Music Fan	I generally don't review movies but I feel that the Kill Bill series begs for my two cents.Volume One has all of the classic elements of that make Tarantino a fixture in edgy modern cinema.To begin with I will point out something that often goes unsaid. Music and soundtracks often are overlooked when it comes to their impact on a film.  In this movie, the choice of sounds and music is perfect.  (Almost like a movie by Cameron Crowe).  While this doesn't contain songs by Pearl Jam or the flavor of the month, a perfect example is the scene (a la Reservoir Dogs) when Lucy Liu's band of bad asses shows up on scene in a local joint in Japan.  This blends perfectly into the music of a Japaneese pop band which entertains the customers...that is until something happens.I don't wish to give away the plot and surprise secrets of this film (as it is some of the brilliance of which makes the movie) but suffice to say the movie is raw, edgy and has a hint of empowerment of women as a theme.Some of the things that happen to Uma Thurman are raw and horrific but again, not placed in the film for sheer shock value.The pace of the film is epic and the culmination of the film simply leaves one asking...why end it here...where is the conclusion...ah...one must wait until Kill Bill volume 2.What else can be said without giving the movie away (as I am sure others who have reviewed the film have done).Art direction.  The choice of colors, and scenes and shots is akin to another great...Stephen Soderburgh.  There is simply so much going on in the film making in this movie...it deserves to be ranked as one of the better films of this generation.  There is comedy (such as a scene between Uma and a sushi chef...and his assistant).  And the subtlety of the movie is not to be overlooked.Enjoy this movie!	4.0	Classic Quintin...Leaves you wanting more!	2005-03-08	2	1	1

Kill Bill Vol. I has everything a great action movie needs: A solid plot, great characters, great actors and actresses, and the main ingredient, great action. I have seen many action movies, and this is by far the best(and bloodiest).The thing that also makes this a great movie is Quentins amazing creativity. I garuntee you that he is the only director who can have a color movie with some black and white seens, and anime. Quentins' creativity is what makes this movie come alive.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	While he may be best known for his stunning '94 masterpiece `Pulp Fiction', much of Quinton Tarantino's debated celebrity lies in the midst of his two-part epic `Kill Bill'.  For the sake of this review, I'm mainly going to focus on the first volume (the second volume is very good, but pales in comparison to this highly inspired first part).  It seems that you either love this film (unapologetically) or you hate it with a passion.I love it!The tale is rather simple.  There is an assassin known mainly as The Bride who is ambushed on her wedding day by her former associates.  Her fianc&eacute;e is killed, as is her unborn child, and she is left for dead.  Thankfully, she lives...but then again, her fellow `hired hands' aren't too thankful.  After The Bride awakes from her coma, she sets off on a revenge filled journey to hunt down her former boss, Bill, and kill him.That doesn't happen in this volume, but this first half of The Bride's destiny is by far the most entertaining.Like I said, the concept and story is rather simple (although it is clearly inspired by `The Bride Wore Black', and you can't go wrong with updating Truffaut!).  That said; this film lives and dies in the hands of Quinton Tarantino.  While the story itself may be simple, the execution is not.  Tarantino is above all else a stylistic director.  He has a clear vision as to how he likes to work things out.  If you take the conversational awkwardness of Woody Allen, the layered storylines of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, the gritty aggression of Martin Scorsese and then filter in influences that range from Japanese Anime and `Matrix' style imagery to dusty John Wayne movies you'd have a Quinton Tarantino flick.  Somehow, Tarantino makes it all work.  I think that is what makes these movies so brilliant.  They are unlike anything you've ever seen before.  They are bright and flashy and engaging and thrilling.They are smart.By pulling Uma Thurman back out of the slums and handing her this role, he re-birthed her so-to-speak.  She really needs to work with him again before she disappears completely (why does she lack a solid career?).  As The Bride, Thurman really shines.  She understands how to create a character that is complete with every ounce of stylistic unreality that Tarantino demands, yet flushed with a sincere sense of reality that keeps her raw and unnerving to the audience.  It's a brilliant turn that deserved all the praise and accolades it garnered.  The supporting cast also works magic here (although it is very true that the second film fairs better in that department, with Daryl Hannah's hissing through her scenes and the late great Carradine adding a much needed layer of nuance to the film).Overall, `Kill Bill, vol. 1' is a slam dunk.  Each frame shimmers forth with excitement that encompasses everything needed to create a fully realized slice of worth-while (and highly memorable) entertainment!	5.0	Just freaking kill him already!	2010-09-14	2	2	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1FE06N5A77K8W	Annie Feng	It wasn't that bad of a movie, it was pretty decent, in a okay kind of way. But I really expected better. Throughtout the whole film, it has VERY little plot, and lots of cliffhangers, such as why the bride was murdered in the first place. I guess(and hope) vol. 2 will explain. But what I most disappointed about this movie was that there's NOT one intelligence in this film, it's just all bloody slaughtering. The bride seems to have NO plan (at least, not a well-plotted one) for the revenge, she just go on massacre and massacre. I mean, I would assume that since they are DEADLY assasins, they would be very discrete and all black ops, you know, but Kill Bill is just basically composed of bloody scenes. I swear, that and a bunch of comic flicks, that's it. If you want to see a good revenge plot, go see Alias, I swear, that show has intelligence, plots that keep you guessing, AND fantastic action, not to mention it's more believable instead of mediocre comic-action plots.As for the whole bloody thing, it doesn't bother me that much, but seriously, IS IT REALLY NECESSARY????? A good action movie really doesn't have to have THAT much blood, not to mention the way the blood comes out is obviously NOT right. Even if you cut a human head off the blood won't pour out like a water fountain. An action movie is for us to see the action, not the blood, making the blood amount to the amount it's suppose to flow is more than enough. I mean, what's it trying to say? That it's a samurai movie? COME ON, massive blood doesn't make it a samurai movie, when are American movies gonna take off all these stereotypes??Overall, unless you REALLY REALLY enjoys blood (then you're a complete freak by the way) I would really recommand looking elsewhere for a good action movie.	3.0	disappointed!	2005-09-10	6	4	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AT6EZU346DOFM	anoymous	The first installment of the Kill Bill series is one of Quentin Tarantino's finest! All Tarantino fans will be more than pleased. It is a nonstop roller coaster ride of carefully crafted fight sequences and blood spurting action that puts slasher flicks to shame. The excessive splatter of blood in nearly every scene and limited dialogue holds up to the formula of the original Kung Fu movies and you will find yourself laughing along at the absurdity of it. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a nice blend of Kung Fu and anime with a little western twist to it that will have you hooked from the opening scene. The story is also riveting. You really connect with Uma Thurman's character and are rooting for her the whole way through. Can't wait for the next installment!	5.0	Not your average Kung Fu	2004-05-02	3	2	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3OT6IQ0YHGDCB	"ANT ""azraelart"""	If &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is nothing else, it definitely is an homage movie, as it really can be difficult to fit into any genre.  I suppose Action would be the most likely suspect, followed by Western, then Samurai, then Kung-Fu, and even Suspense, Thriller, and Drama.  Mostly, though, it is Tarantino having a blast in honoring the films he grew up watching.  Yes, we definintely know this now, as the DVD has a 'making of' featurette in which he tells us so.  (Hence the appearance of Sonny Chiba in the Okinawa chapter).It would not be fair to simply call this a tribute film, however, as Tarantino by combining the genres and styles has created something altogether new.  What is marvelous about the film, though, is how the melting pot adds a good deal of comedy to the movie as well.  While the Crazy 88 is being torn apart by The Bride (brilliantly performed by Uma Thurman), there is an almost comic-book like appearance to the scenes.  True, that is your kung-fu aspect at work, but like so many of those kung-fu movies, they were quite humorous in the impossible amount of carnage that can be exacted by one lone warrior.By the way, there is also a gorgeous tribute to Anime as well, done through a flashback 'origin' story about Lucy Liu's beginnings.  She too is amazing in her role and the majority of the movie deals with her.  Thank goodness, too, as she is a joy to watch on screen and Tarantino obviously knew her talents and potential when he wrote her part.A bit of a warning, though.  This movie is definitely NOT for kids.  I don't care how mature they might think they are, please use some discretion before screening this to a youngster.  There are some very disturbing images and themes, despite the afore-mentioned cartoon-like quality to some of the scenes.  Some of the other scenes certainly are not as amusing.  Still, if you're into the genres or tribute movies, if you enjoy quality cinema and don't mind a bit (okay, a lot) of bloodshed, this truly is the movie to own.  There are so many things to like and so many film classes that could spawn off of this movie alone.  Enjoy!	5.0	Probably the best 'homage' film made	2004-04-14	1	1	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A32X3PGY5VLNPG	Anth	The first thing you must know about the Kill Bill movies are that they are spoofing all the old westerns and martial arts films. the blood and gore are kept at a relatively decent rate mostly because the gore scenes are in animation. When watching this movie you will see the sherrif and his son, black and white scenes for some of the flashbacks and some martial arts that are reminders of Charlie Chan mixed with Crouching tiger Hidden Dragon. All in all it is a fun movie to watch but don't let any kid age 14 and under see it, they won't understand it and might find it a little scary.	5.0	Fun and spoofing of all the old westerns	2005-08-05	1	1	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AR15V2ULA2EYM	Antonio Giusto	I'm an indipendent film maker turned Hollywood. Not that I was any good in my days as a indipendent film maker. A long time ago I learned a neat little trick to fool dumb film audiences into thinking I actually have a speck of talent. It's very simple you see. All you have to do is take bits and peices of stories from films you love, mix it all up in a screenplay, and pass it off as your own origional idea's. Make sure to also add catchy dialogue about fast food chains, plenty of violence, and lots of drug refrences and abuse. Stupid audiences with attention defecit disorder like that kinda stuff.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A143I6WXLSW5CE	Anton Lee	Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill is a throw back to the retro 70's revenge movie is not only a tribute but also grand come back to those styles of filmmaking.  Uma Thurman is Wonderful, and Lucy Lu is just as great as her adversary.  This is the first part of a two part movie, and while that is frustrating because I will have to wait to the next chapter to find out what had happen, but judging by this movie, it will be worth the wait	4.0	The return of the revenge flick.	2003-11-04	5	2	3
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A21M7JSRRQFC0G	A On Amazon	"This movie is one of my favorites and one of the best I've seen. I will say that when I saw the commercial for this movie, I had absolutely no interest in seeing it. I only saw it because my boyfriend wanted to see it at the theatres, so we went. After I saw it at the theatre, I wasn't sure if I liked it or not...but then it stated to grow on me for a bit. It wasn't until my boyfriend got the DVD and we watched it again I realized I had to buy it myself. I don't know how many times I've seen it. The movie is basically about a woman who aims to get revenge at a group of assasins who betrayed her. I can use some desciptions out of many for this movie: sassy, quick, colorful, different, emotional (and not in a sappy type of way). The picture, the color, the characters, the different types of genres incorporated all worked well. I thought the color usage was excellent(blue backdrops, black and white scene, character outfits contrasting the backround, scenes as a whole, etc)...the picture was excellent. The characters all worked well in their own different ways and it was interesting how they each contributed to the film. You'll have a few quirky scenes or people (the 5,6,7,8's for example). The outfits were certainly interesting (O-Ren's white kimono (and black one too), The Bride's yellow jumpsuit, Gogo's schoolgirl outfit, Elle's nurse attire, etc). I personally loved the music. All of the music fit WELL with the scenes...some matched the emotion of the scene and some contrasted it but it still blended in well. Favorite was ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood""...a mix of dance, disco, rock and Spanish style incorporated into it. Oh and for those who were confused by the beeps in the beginning and the other one later on, it was just a BEEP TO COVER UP THE BRIDE'S NAME. I was a little suprised to see another DVD film with someone else wearing the same yellow jumpsuit with the black stripe on it (I don't remember what the movie was called. I guess Tarantino borrowed that costume idea from another movie, but I guess other than that, I would recommend for people who like movies with some sword/katana play, ""kung-fu"" type action, anime (anime scene for about 10 min or so). I've heard many reviews saying that this movie was supposed to be funny as well, so you might find some comedy in it? I didn't think it was a comedy...it did have a bit of funny moments but it wasn't hilarious or anything like that, in my opinion. Also, a lot of people tend to think this movie has some violent scenes, so if you don't have much patience for violent events on screen, then I caution you. Otherwise, I'd recommend you probably rent it before you buy because it is more of the type of movie that not everyone would like (more of a love it or hate it type)."	5.0	Hotness...Awesomeness...Sassiness...	2005-06-27	1	0	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3FN1E32ENP19R	"Archange M. Chavannes ""Mike Chavannes"""	I have to say that I think Tarantino is starting to lose it. . .if in fact he ever really had it.  Kill Bill presents the rather hackneyed theme of a member of a special organization betrayed by said organization and now looking for revenge on everyone who wronged her.  This really isn't the main problem with the movie, though.  I am a tremendous Uma Thurman fan, but she is a very unconvincing character in this movie.  Although she masks her lack of martial arts knowledge acceptably well, she just didn't sell me on her role of a coldblooded killer who has still held on to the humanity and compassion of a mother.  I've always applauded her as an actress, but I have to strongly disagree with Tarantino's choice for this particular role.Throughout the movie, I could see a glimmer of what I thought Tarantino was trying to achieve, but I was left feeling that he just fell short and ended up with a movie that was just plain cheesy.  He keeps with his signature technique of jumping around in the timeline which I rather like.  It allows the story to unfold like a thousand exciting discoveries that ultimately meld together into a complete picture.  My compliments end there, though.  His characters acted like they'd been created by a teenage comic book writer.  The fight scenes although action packed, lacked any technical skill.  As for the cinematography, it was mediocre at best.  Frankly, although I tried very hard to accept this movie as a unique artistic endeavor, I ended up finding it simply ridiculous.	2.0	It's no Pulp Fiction	2004-05-23	5	4	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E	"Archie Mercer ""Archie"""	"First & foremost, I liked this film. In fact, I liked both Kill Bill movies, although for different reasons. For this review, we'll focus on Volume 1.When you view the film for the first time there is so much thrown on the screen you end up missing a lot. The more times you watch, the more new things you see, driving you to continue re-watching. Plain & simple, this is a fun film. However, let's be honest. A fun film, absolutely. A good film, definitely. A great film may be pushing it. A masterpiece....Nah. The reason: Tarantino wasn't trying to produce a masterpiece. In an interview I watched he claims he made these films to see how great of a director he was, to see if ""there was a ceiling"" to his genius. I don't think that was the reason. I believe Tarantino made these films to see how much he could get away with and still be called genius. From the reactions of critics & moviegoers I would say he got away with a lot.Volume 1 is mostly an ""action"" flick. The basic plot is about revenge. The Bride, played extremely well by Uma Thurman, has been beaten to a bloody pulp, shot in the head, and left for dead by the deadly Viper Assassination squad, of which she was once a member. After getting pregnant and bailing out of the group she is tracked down by Bill & company. We are treated to a series of chapters that take us back & forth over the past 4 years. There are some parts that seemed to be mostly filler, like the cartoon chapter ""The origin of O'ren"". That just wasn't needed and, to me, actually made the middle of the film drag. But there were also some absolutely great scenes. One of the most powerful scenes is watching the anguish of The Bride when she wakes from her 4 year coma to find she's not pregnant anymore. And, of course, the massive fight scene where she takes on an army of samarai body guards so that she can reach O'ren is exciting, amazing, and even humorous at times. Well worth the wait to get there.Again, overall I liked this movie amd continue to watch it over & over. One caution: Don't expect volume 2 to be the same type of film. As I mentioned, Volume 1 is action-packed. While Volume 2 has some of that it tends to be a bit more cerebral."	4.0	A Strangely Addictive Film	2005-03-29	1	0	1

The violence is tawdry, unexplained, and the camera alternately snoozes and leers over it.  The characters are *less* than cartoonish stereotypes -- half of them don't even get named, and none of them have an inkling of motivation.  The editing and soundtrack are plagiarized from much better movies.Just a waste.	1.0	Vile	2005-11-07	24	9	15

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1WB5NZYY5XR8A	"Ash1138 ""Just a middle aged guy living in Col..."	I saw Kill Bill earlier today. Thankfully I saw a Matinee or I would have felt even more ripped of from this shamefully stretched filmIt's not that Kill Bill was a bad film, but I'm more against cutting the film in half than I ever was before. This film (or first half rather) is way too short. Even with 13-minutes of credits, it barely tops 90-minutes. Unfortunately, the film doesn't seem short when you are watching it because it moves along so slowly. This is mostly to do with the fact that Tarantino doesn't seem to know when to cut a film to save his life. On the contrary, this film is so completely loaded with filler that even people who don't understand the art of editing will likely be questioning Tarantino's choice of letting a shot drag on way too long or being chock full of redundant scenes.Of course we know exactly why Kill Bill was edited this way. Because it was already foolish enough to try to pass off an 80-minute film to audiences in this day and age, especially when it's not the full film. It would be beyond imbecilic to show a 60-minute film, but that's what it should have been.This story is way over told. As an audience member, watching Kill Bill is like listening to someone tell you something you very much want to here but they are talking very, very slooowly. Get on with it already! How many times do we need to see Uma Thurman sitting in her seat on the plan with her katana (do they allow katanas on planes?) at the ready? How many times do I need to see that exterior shot of the airliner she's a passenger on that lasts for twice as long as it should? This is an action movie for crying out loud! Or so Quentin lead us all to believe.There is action in Kill Bill, but there is action in a lot of films that aren't action films. Most of the action in this film is done the American way; quick cuts and close ups. I'm rather surprised seeing that Tarantino is such a student of Asian cinema that he would film Kill Bill in such a way. The reason Americans shoot like this is because it's far easier to imply action than actually show it. And after hearing Tarantino trash the Wachowski's I was really expecting fight scenes that at least lived up to anything in The Matrix.And for a simplistic film that is basically supposed to be all fighting with little story, there's far to little action. Indeed, you really only see any impressive action in the 5th (last) chapter of the film. And while the shows big money action finale is good, it really should make you appreciate the Burly Brawl from The Matrix Reloaded that much more.But as I said, Kill Bill isn't bad. There's the definate lack of editing, far too slow pacing for an action film, a decidedly weird change to animation for one long scene in the film, a completely non-sensical decision to have the film suddenly transition to black and white through the big money finale and later change back to color at the literal blink of an eye, and the fact that most of the key action is implied rather than shown among other things, but for all it's faults most people who can stomach gallons of blood spraying out of gaping wounds, severed limbs, and headless corpses should enjoy the film.Get one thing straight, even with as much blood and violence this film contains, Kill Bill is a drama. It's not the Godfather by any means, but it is akin to the speghetti westerns by Leone (which were ironically akin to old samurai films). Tarantino does what he always does; focuses on the scene and the characters dialogue in it. Even the action scenes are simply excuses for the characters to spout their messages to each other or communicate their motivation with some sort of body language. Like all Tarantino's films, Kill Bill basically a collection of scenes full of hip, cool dialogue, all connected together to form a story.I liked Kill Bill, but I didn't drool over it. 20-minutes could have been and more importantly, SHOULD have been edited out of the final cut, and I can only guess the second volume is the same way, leading me again back to the question, why wasn't this released as a single, solid 2-hour film instead of fluffed up to 3-hours and then cut in half?	3.0	Pay full price, get half a movie.	2003-10-11	21	1	20

Yet I persevered and was aptly rewarded with a scintillating performance by all concerned and in particular Uma Thurman who, as a bride, was brutally beaten while her groom was being murdered.  And what a beating it was - kick, pow, bam!! In fact, throughout the movie, one can't decide if it is a comedy, mystery, farce, drame  or arte nouveau.I remain ambiguous about Quentin Tarantino as a director but in this film he delivers the goods.  The comic book presentation was another ""juvenile"" element that worked perfectly, the fights a combination Matrix, Bruce Lee and Live Studio Wrestling. (The Oriental sword scene made me want to stand and cheer.) What WAS important were the things left unsaid: Why the horrific beating?  What about the child?  What was her past? For heaven's sake, what's her friggin name???  (Or did I miss that?) Of course  the ending sets us up for Episode II in which our Supergirl / Jane Bond delivers an licking that won't stop.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AI46E73DWKD2B	BackToGood	"For as much violence and gore as is contained in Quentin Tarantino's FOURTH FILM (as he so gratuitously informs us in the opening credits!), I think that KILL BILL VOLUME ONE is a great example of the ""less is more"" philosophy of filmmaking. Of all of Tarantino's films, this one has the LEAST dialogue. In fact, it is really minimalist. I don't think there is one wasted line in the whole film! It just cuts (literally) to the chase. In all his other films, with possibly the exception of PULP FICTION, I really think that some of the extraneous, extended dialogue ruins some or all of the film experience.KILL BILL VOLUME ONE has a singular plot: a mysterious woman (given the moniker ""The Bride"" by the head of a group of Texas Rangers who find her the sole survivor of her wedding day massacre in a small Texas church), is out to avenge the death of her baby at the hands of her former assassin colleagues The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. The group's leader is ""Bill"", heard, but unseen to the viewer during his part in the film. Bill shot The Bride in the head but she survived and was comatose for 4 years before awakening. ""The Bride"" is played by Uma Thurman, who IMHO gives the best performance of her career and should have garnered a Best Actress nomination for fully transforming herself into an athletic, cold-blooded, take-no-prisoners death machine! Thurman is entirely convincing in this role and never once did I doubt her character or her goal.In VOLUME ONE, Tarantino has The Bride only go after Vernita Green (played to the hilt by Vivica Fox in a brief, juicy role) and O'Ren Ishii (superbly played by Lucy Liu). The Bride's confrontation with Vernita sets up the film and this scene is an impressive, bloody, chickfight of hand-to-hand combat with a very satisfying conclusion. The film is told nonlinearly as we see early on that The Bride has already taken out O'Ren and the rest of the film details the sequence of events leading up to this. Tarantino really displays extremely competent, confident filmmaking during these sequences as he smoothly transitions from one story to the next, including a wonderful Japanese anime scene detailing the backstory of O'Ren and The Bride's seeking out famed swordsmaker Hattori Hanzo (pitch-perfect Sonny Chiba) to obtain a sword that ""even God himself"" would fear! The exciting, pulse-pounding climax has The Bride take on O'Ren's psychotic teen bodyguard Gogo Yubari (impressive ingenue Chiaki Kuriyama) and her ""Crazy 88"" army. Then, finally, the swordfight between The Bride and O'Ren, a beautifully executed (no pun intended!) otherwordly scene.What makes KILL BILL VOLUME ONE a masterpiece to me is that Tarantino perfectly mixes elements of several film genres and sub-genres (70s kung fu, Western, revenge, chick flick) into a brilliantly edited film. He also infuses the film with timely, snappy, witty, comical dialogue and narration (Thurman's) as well as perfect music choices, esp. using that Japanese group in the club at the film's climax to underscore the upcoming action. Nothing feels out of place or unnecessary in this film. In summary, it all just comes together!KILL BILL VOLUME ONE is about as entertaining as it gets!"	5.0	Quentin Tarantino's BEST film!	2010-02-02	1	1	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1K3KYRX1ZD3QC	"B. Crawford ""Life is good"""	"My first viewing of this volume in the Kill Bill saga occurred at two in the morning, as I suffered from severe insomnia. I was desperate, hoping that it would help me drift off. Unfortunately, or rather, fortunately, this film did anything but. The action, cinematography, and witty script blew me away; I loved it. The next day, however, I was surprised to learn that many people I knew did not feel the same way as I did regarding this flick. Willing to form a better opinion of the movie and shrugging the fact that I loved it off to simply being overtired, I watched it again.I still loved it. And herein was where I realized that this film is not for everyone. As it is a homage film, a tribute to Spaghetti Westerns and Kung-Fu flicks, one must look from this perspective. I myself enjoy these genres of film and lapped up Tarantino's unique and witty take on them. It is apparent (as it is in most of his work) that he is a great fan as well.As mentioned numerous times by others, there is gore abound here. Ridiculous violence, blood spurting everywhere, and bodies flying constantly. But somehow Mr. Tarantino, and you may call him sick or twisted  for it, made all the slicing and dicing humorous and never too serious, witty lines and funny visuals all the way through. True cinematic genius in my book.On the surface it looks like a senselessly violent revenge movie, but underneath it is far more. Like most of Tarantino's films, Kill Bill is riddled with culture references and contains a wonderfully varied soundtrack; absolute joy for the pop culture buff. It is a cleverly written, and the wonderful talent of all involved is clearly exhibited.On to the acting, Uma Thurman is a true standout. Prior to this film I hadn't thought much of her, even believing her to be overrated. This one role of hers changed my opinion completely. Thurman is brilliant as ""The Bride""; her piercing eyes and intense persona portray a woman out for revenge amazingly. Lucy Liu is also impressive as a cold Yakuza headlady, and Vivica A. Fox and Daryl Hannah both provide great supporting roles as well.Overall this film is most definitely not something that everyone will go for- in fact, most will find it odd for the first ten minutes or so, but stick with it. This film is one of the most brilliant in recent years, even though it might not hit you with its depth right away. Highly recommended.**By the way, make sure to buy Volume 2 along with your purchase of Volume 1- the films were intended to be one but due to time constraints two were made, as you see them now. It will add for a more complete viewing experience, not to mention the cliffhanger at the end of the first."	5.0	Brilliant, Not For Everyone However	2007-05-28	4	3	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1EI65WJC85U68	"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k"""	"Finally here it is! Part 1 of the movie film buffs have been salivating for for the past six years. KILL BILL sees Tarantino return to the multiplexes with a vengeance; and if you thought RESERVOIR DOGS was bloody, then baby! You ain't seen NUTHIN' yet!KILL BILL VOLUME 1 sees Tarantino reuniting with Uma Thurman; who gives what is almost inarguably the finest performance of her career to date. Thurman plays The Bride, a professional assassin who is targeted for extermination on her wedding day by her boss Bill (David Carradine- who of course starred in the '70s TV series KUNG FU). Obviously she survives & in the tried and true tradition of kung-fu flicks sets out to wreck (extremely) bloody vengeance on members of The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, the organisation that once employed her, saving Bill for last.Many will be sickened by the graphic violence in this: the scene where The Bride is tortured early on actually made my stomach queasy & there is also a scene where a hospital orderly is taking money from some lowlife to (almost) rape the comatose bride, a scene that I found rather sick, but the impact lessened the second time I saw the scene (I had to attend the film twice because the theater got the reels mixed up after the 1st hour)& actually it's one of many standouts in the film.Though some could dismiss Tarantino as a guy who just makes crude, grapically violent films inspired by the B movies he saw as a kid; there's really no denying the man has genuine talent. KILL BILL VOL 1 sees him employing almost every cinematic technique you can imagine: from split screen format to an over-the-top hentai animation sequence, which is very cool indeed.In my humble opinion, KILL BILL VOLUME 1 is a masterpiece. The film manages to bridge the gap between contemporary & pop art & the kung-fu/revenge/exploitation genres to create an unparalleled adrenalin rush. This is easily Tarantino's best work since PULP FICTION, though don't hold your breath waiting for the Academy to acknowledge that.As usual the cast list is interesting: Lucy Liu, the legendary Sonny Chiba, Daryl Hannah (as an eyepatch wearing assassin who looks VERY sexy in her nurse's outfit), Michael Madsen & more...Not surprisingly the P.C police in NZ have again been calling for the Chief Censor's head for letting this through- which shows what a pathetic lot NZ has in positions of power. Minority rules. My advice to these people is to get a life & stop forcing their views upon others. I hope to see MANY more films like this. As long as the movies have an age restriction & there's a note about the content the adults should be allowed to choose what they watch. I encourage Kiwis to go see KBV1 & make it a reasonable sized hit. The state should NEVER be allowed to own your mind or body- especially in a country where the PM is allowed to get away with signing a painting she didn't do, & where the public is seldom consulted in the passing of legislation that affects everyone: I've got David Benson-Dope to do that for me!So go see KILL BILL, support the censors, indulge your right as an adult to free choice: the right to form your individual opinion, the right to freedom of artistic expression in all its mediums, the right to quash fundamentalist ""watchdog groups"" who ""know"" whats best for YOU & ME, & stop NZ from becoming the next Socialist Republic as the result Helen Clark's Half-Assed Hidden Agenda. I'll get off my pedestal now. Thank you for bearing with me.P.S: And the right to burn the NZ flag if you wish.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1JXE27STRRE0H	"Beardyjin ""beardyjin"""	"Reviews of the film are numerous here, so I won't go into plot detail other than to say this is Uma Thurman as the ultimate killing machine killing other people who are almost, but not quite, as good at killing as she is. Kill Bill vol. 1 is the more action oriented of the two volumes, not that vol. 2 isn't without its good share, but vol. 1 is NON STOP ACTION. The final 30 minutes of the film is one big, bloody fight at the House of the Blue Leaves. This is director Quentin Tarantino's homage and entrance into the genre of revenge films. It's also his homage to the Japanese genre of samurai movies, Yakuza gangster films and anime all rolled up into a blood soaked, sword swinging sushi roll.However, I can only recommend putting THIS DVD version of the film in your collection if you're a die-hard ""gimme my Uma fix now"" fan that wants to own the US theatrical release version. Director Quentin Tarantino has already put together a re-edited combined version of both volumes for the 2004 Cannes film festival. And Miramax has already let it slip a &quot;special edition&quot; of vol. 1 will likely coincide with the release of vol.2 on DVD. I hope that these future DVDs will include the full color House of Blue Leaves scene Tarantino made for the Japanese and Hong Kong release versions of the film. I've seen both the US and Asian versions and I must say the full color rampage Uma goes on is much more intense than the partial black and white US version. The 20 minute  ""making of"" is informative, but you can tell there's a lot more to be said by all involved on this film, and we'll likely see and hear it when the ""special edition"" is released.Bottom line: The film gets 5 stars. This extras-bare DVD version gets 2.5 stars."	5.0	Genre Classic	2004-05-08	0	0	0

Personally, I loved it (as well as Volume 2, a wacky yet mature conclusion to the homage-fest that was Volume 1).  Everything from the cinematography to the way Tarantino strategically places music throughout his films, Quentin gets better with each outing.  The House of Blue Leaves sequence alone will be studied in film schools for years to come.  The PERFECT action sequence from a director who has never done an action sequence before.  The pacing, the music, the use of color (from black and white to the silhouetted fight), the hilarity of limbs flying everywhere.  Tarantino is the man.  No one can question his ability to get the most out of his actors.  Where can I start?  Travolta and Jackson in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.  Grier and Forster in &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;.  And virtually everyone (especially Thurman and Carradine) in &quot;Kill Bill&quot;.And a little ditty from Tom Moore, taken from an earlier review:&quot;This film features a couple of vengeful females trying to be tough like men.Its a predictable overused theme in many films today and americans are growing bored with it.Watching men do fight scenes is far more entertaining,especially remembering that men invented Kung Fu and sword fighting.Men invented physical toughness too.&quot;Boy, I don't know if I even want to touch that one.  Feeling a little insecure there, Tom?  Have to defend the notion that men are better at being big and bad to boost your feelings of masculinity?  Personally, I enjoyed watching Uma kick some ace.  Here's one American who's not tired of seeing some women kick tail (as long as it's done the right way; i.e. NOT Charlie's Angels).	5.0	Love it...	2004-04-18	12	10	2

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AH4QC08TEHNYF	Benjamin Timberlake	Many reviews of this movie have declared it as trash, a movie without any sort of values, which is totally crazy.  Quentin Tarentino set out to make an exciting, fast-paced, gripping, violent Kung-Fu movie, and he totally succeeds.  The acting is careful and fun, the sets in the movie are almost cartoony, as well is the violence.  If the violence is too offensive for people, they shouldn't see it, but if you watch the violence in the movie AS the art of the movie, you've got yourself an art picture.  The plot is simple, but that doesn't make it dumb.  The music that is integrated throughout the picture, with the help of the Wu-Tang's clan the RZA, sets such a desolate and artificial tone, that the movie never really feels like it is set in the real world, which is perfect for it.  I love this movie, and any critic who refers to it as trash, namely Anthony Lane of the New Yorker, has absolutely no sense of humor, which is too bad, for he missed out on a great, fun movie.	5.0	The Right Angle	2004-01-06	3	2	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1OPHU24M4CD6O	Benjamin Wood	"Quentin Tarantino has made a career of writing and directing fantastic films, and with the first volume of the Kill Bill duet the tradition continues. On the surface, Kill Bill: Volume 1 spins like an above average revenge flick - an ex-assassin known only as ""The Bride"" is brutally tortured on her wedding day by her former employer's lethal band of contract killers: the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. The `blood-splattered bride' is left for dead on the church floor, but her wounds eventually heal and four years later she begins her personal quest for revenge. Plot points such as these, however, are not what make Kill Bill (or any Tarantino film for that matter) special.From the first grizzly minute all the way to the credits, every shot, every character, every line of dialogue, and every aspect of the story is driven by Tarantino's love for Hong Kong martial arts films, samurai movies, spaghetti westerns, and revenge flicks. These influences can be seen everywhere - from the camera framing copied from The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, to the final battle at the House of Blue Leaves where The Bride wears a yellow catsuit very much like the one worn by Bruce Lee in Game of Death. Tarantino uses references such as these to give Kill Bill: Volume 1 a cinematic depth that most revenge films can't match.Quentin Tarantino dropped out of school at the tender age of 16 to pursue acting. However, he developed his love of film while working at a video rental shop in California. Since then, Tarantino has directed a total of five films, written eight, and won an Oscar (for Pulp Fiction). His love of film bleeds through every frame of every movie he is directly linked to - as evident by his use of homage as a film style. Pulp Fiction paid tribute to (among other things) gangster movies. In Reservoir Dogs, it was heist films and undercover cop stories. And in Kill Bill it was revenge, samurai showdowns, and old Westerns.One of the strongest aspects of Kill Bill is that Tarantino embraced the simple mentality of typical revenge flicks while, at the same time, generously applying his own spirit. By default, movies that deal with reprisals tend to be a little bit shallow and predictable - someone has to kill or harm someone else for some wrongdoing.What sets Kill Bill apart is the dialogue. For the film's entire 111 minute running time, the story is unfurled using dialogue that is packed with black comedy, old Asian legends, pop culture references, and extraordinary bravado. For example, when The Bride awakens in a hospital bed four years after the massacre, she learns that when she was comatose the head hospital attendant was acting as her pimp - selling her for $50 a ""session."" While this might have otherwise come across as a totally revolting and extremely dire situation, the dialogue and characters involved turn the scene into black comedy gold by playing off of the hick stereotype associated with many small Texas towns.Another example of where the dialogue shines is when The Bride travels to the tiny island of Okinawa, Japan to meet with the legendary sword smith Hattori Hanzo.  The nature of the film changes dramatically (for the better) as Hanzo passes on ancient Samurai proverbs to aid The Bride in her fight. This scene sets up a more purposeful tone for the remainder of the film and might contain the most powerful lines in the entire movie. Before giving the `yellow-haired warrior' (The Bride) his powerful `Hanzo Steel' samurai blade, Hattori effectively sums up the entire idea of vengeance by saying that revenge is ""never a straight line. It's a forest, and like a forest it's easy to lose your way."" This is the type of dialogue that sets Kill Bill apart. The ideas behind it are not new, but they are executed in such a way that they come off as fresh, funky, and unique.The only downfall of Kill Bill: Volume 1 is the way it was released. Originally, Tarantino wrote and directed the project as one film. However, due to its four-hour plus running time, the Miramax production company decided to split it into two `volumes.' Due to this separation, the first volume comes across as light on story and heavy on violence while the second part seems light on action and heavy on plot exploration. The difference is especially noticeable in Kill Bill: Volume 2, which contains only two major fight sequences. The lack of closure at the end of Volume 1, due to Miramax's attempt to sell multiple tickets to the same movie, must be listed as a flaw of Tarantino's (otherwise) brilliant project.Kill Bill is an experience. It pulls ideas from many different cultures, movies, genres, legends, and old television shows, and packages them together in one super-fine blood-soaked escapade. The only problem is that it's not one escapade (as it was originally meant to be) - it's two. Splitting the film causes a jarring shift in tone that's difficult to ignore. The best solution is to watch both DVDs back-to-back, thus eliminating what might be the only problem with one of the best films of the past decade."	5.0	Revenge at its best	2007-09-04	3	3	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A33693RRRFK55Q	"B. Erickson ""boycorrupted"""	"There are as of this writing already 182 reviews for ""Kill Bill,"" so it's absolutely pointless for me to add my two cents to the mountain of change - but what can I say, this is a movie you just want to talk about.  I mean, it's obviously designed for real ""heads"" to dissect, virtual Frankenstein composed of the body parts of dead Hong Kong flicks that it is; but it stands on its own for less informed moviegoers as a typically Tarantinan bloodbath of ultraviolence, replete with sick humor and lurid cinematography.When I saw this in the theatre, I was amused by the fact that people got up and left in disgust every time another freshly decapitated torso spurted blood ten feet in the air, which was more or less every 3 minutes.  The other half laughed and made lewd comments about Uma Thurman.  Personally, I can take the violence as a stylistic choice without developing an urge to go shoot up my school, so I can appreciate what Tarantino is doing here - even though I'm sure I only got about an eighth of the references (if that).  It's almost as if you were flipping through a bunch of those old action films on your TV and you suddenly noticed that they somehow completed each other's plots.  It's true that ""Kill Bill"" is ""only"" a revenge story at core, but since when is that a criticism?  True, it may be mostly a ""technical"" endeavor - so what?  What this movie attempts to do, it does quite well, and that's all I'm concerned with when it comes to playing armchair critic.Nice job by Uma.  I've heard the criticism that she's an unlikely choice for a samurai, but that was obviously the point. She reacts with exactly the correct degree of irony when the scene calls for it, and it usually does.Practically everybody else in the film is her enemy, beginning with Vivica A. Fox.  The impressive first scene sets the general tone of the movie as fast-paced, violent, tragic-comic, provocative, and blatantly derivative.  Later we get a dose of the backstory, including some Politically Correct Violence as rape victim Uma exacts brutal revenge on her rapist.  Then it's off to Okinawa to acquire some steel to take on her next opponent, Lucy Liu.  And then...the limbs really start to fly.But I mean, come on.  What did you expect?  Is this really THAT shocking, coming from QT?  It's hard to sympathize with the suburban soccer mom who brought her 13-year-old to ""Kill Bill"" and then got up indignantly halfway through and dragged him out of the theatre, disrupting all we discriminating adults.  It's as if somebody went to a porno flick and complained about all the gratuitous sex.  If you want an ""uplifting story of the triumph of the human spirit,"" then go rent some paltry, sappy, contrived piece of trash starring Tom Hanks, and make yourself a nice hot cup of international coffee.  If you happen to enjoy celluloid violence and action and irony and dorky in-jokes, and you happen to not already be a raving lunatic, then you can probably go see this film without subsequently running amok on society with a chainsaw.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3QLZ79JF6R1A4	Bigflu	Quentin Tarantino broke out with Pulp Fiction because of it's innovative scene sequences and intermingling sub-plots. In other words, he tried something different and it worked. He tries it again with Kill Bill, inter-mingling storylines, and different scene sequence orientation. It's not as strong as an effect as with Pulp Fiction, but it works well.Kill Bill centers around a bride-to-be who was killed off by her co-workers for whatever reason (I'm hoping it's revealed in the sequel). But they fail, and essentially let her live. So her main motive of living at this point becomes 'revenge'. She attempts to track down all those responsible for her attempted death, and make them pay.True Tarantino style action and lots of blood. Tarantino pays homage to some of the old kung-fu films, as well as dips his hand into the japanese animation for a brief stint. It works, and seems to flow with the stroyline well. I highly recommend this film to any fan of his previous films, but keep in mind that it's not Pulp Fiction.	4.0	Tarantino Is Innovative	2004-04-23	3	1	2

This is a COMEDY - if you take this movie seriously you deserve the seven alarm heartburn that will ensue.  This is Tarrentino's big F-U to the people that kept whining that he wasn't making enough movies - and when he did - that they weren't as good as Pulp Fiction.  Complaining about this movie being bad is like complaining that the old Batman TV series wasn't ""true"" to the comic book - this movie is meant to be camp taken to an extreme.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A24M2KN27MDEXO	bill_the_great	"The two things by which Quentin Tarantino has made a name for  himself over the past decade or so since Reservoir Dogs came out is clever dialogue that is saturated with obscure pop culture references and stylized violence.  In Kill Bill, his fourth film, Tarantino virtually abandons the first tier of his legacy in favor of all-out kung-fu/samurai violence.  The whole movie is an obvious tribute to the B-grade kung-fu action movies of the seventies.  But, like all good escapist fare, it makes you forget about the lack of plot, character development etc.  with eye-popping action and violence.The basic plot is this:  an assasin thought to have been killed on her wedding day by her former employer seeks revenge after waking up from a four-year coma.Sounds simple, but hey, do you go to action movies for the plot?  No, of course not, you go for the ""shock and awe"" and Tarantino seems to perfectly understand that.The one thing that shocked me about the film was how utterly violent it really was.  It put the most ferocious scenes in the last three Tarantino films to shame.  In fact, I thought that I had been completely desensitized to violence in media however, some of the scenes were too gross for me and frankly made my stomach churn.If your looking for amazing action and cinematography, Kill Bill is right for you.  If you're looking for the clever comedy that Tarantino is known for, pass on it; and if you are easily offended by gross, cartoonish violence, I would recommend avoiding it.

Uma carried the action superbly through both films and gave a credible performance as an action figure, though the choreography saved the day for most everyone wielding weapons of one sort or another. In some behind-the-scenes materials and production interviews Quintin pays homage to a genre of Asian films he presumably watched as a kid, yet the western influences of Huxley and Orwell in the way the stories were crafted to interleave past and present in excruciating detail help Quintin practically create a new contemporary genre. Overall, both volumes were fun to watch. They were good epic entertainment.	4.0	Quintin Knows How To Make Movies	2014-04-25	0	0	0

I for one, love this flick! Uma Thurman is beautiful, vengeful, and perfectly lethal as ""The Bride"", driven to track down and pay back those who made such a mess of her wedding day. The fight scenes between The Bride and Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox) are startling. When Copperhead's daughter comes home from school, we don't know what will happen next! The Bride's trip to Japan is of course, the odyssey that leads to the ultimate confrontation between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) in that soon-to-be-bloodsoaked Tokyo nightclub, The House Of Blue Leaves. Tarentino pulls out the stopper and lets the shredded limbs fly! I'm not a gore fan, yet the excess didn't bother me a bit. It simply added to the overall mood / atmosphere of the film. It's a very darkly humorous, intentionally over-the-top, samurai sword swinging, tribute to Bruce Lee and all things kung-Fu cheese!

This is probably the most entertaining movie in the world. There are a lot of people that criticize this movie for having a very simple plot, a large amount of violence, and barely any moral to it. Dont worry about all that psychological mumbo jumbo crap that all those so-called movie experts want. A movie expert should respect every form of cinema. Who cares if it has the simplest plot ever made, who cares what all the other people say about it. A lot of people say that it is TOO violent, there's TOO ""language"" in it, there's TOO much this.. There's TOO much that. Who cares?!!! It's what we want to see, and it's the best movie i've ever seen. This movie has everything there is to offer in a good movie.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A20IIR0422G3A5	"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold"""	Quentin Tarantino originally made the `Kill Bill' movie to be seen in a single showing. While one is not left with many dangling loose ends as you are when you walk out of the first `Lord of the Rings' chapter `The Fellowship of the Ring', you definitely feel an imbalance created by the intensity of some scenes unbalanced by a suitable resolution. Tarantino strikes me as one of those rare directors who will take risky scenes to their logical conclusion and make them work much better than if he had lost his nerve and abbreviated the action in the scene. This is similar to Stanley Kubrick who, in `2001' can draw an utterly banal scene out to great lengths to intensify the drama of the scene to follow. As with Kubrick, Tarantino can generally pull this off, but the technique betrays him a bit in this movie, due to the absence of the resolving scene, to be continued in `Kill Bill Volume 2'.By far the most famous scene in this movie is the combat scene between `The Bride' played by Uma Thurman and the Tokyo crime gang of the object of the Bride's first revenge target. Aside from missing the resolution of a proper denouement, the scene is pure comic book superhero implausible. I will even go so far as to say that it is not even the best choreographed battle scene I have ever scene on film with hand to hand weapons. That distinction goes to some of the battle scenes in the Brad Pitt vehicle, `Troy', which succeeds in saying new things about filming hand to hand combat with edged weapons. Tarantino relies on relatively standard albeit very competent `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' style choreography. Even if one buys into the absurd notion of 21st century combat with Samurai swords rather than Uzi's or Kalishnakovs, the notion of a warrior's beating 90 to 1 odds in an open field without even the advantage of a bottleneck like the famous battle of Thermopyle is less believable than an elf warrior bringing down an Oliphant crowned with 10 archers in the big battle scene of `Lord of the Rings'. After all, in `Rings', we have already bought into a fantasy world where swords and arrows are the only weapons available to the hero of inherently special abilities on the side of truth and justice, not just out for revenge.Aside from this imbalance created by the `big fight scene' without a resolution, the movie is clearly first rate, in many ways the equal to `Volume 2' in the quality of the direction and story line. Tarantino's famously asynchronous scene placements are masterfully done to achieve a positive effect on the impact of the storytelling. Tarantino's technique was a bit unsure in `Reservoir Dogs' but it was used to very good effect in `Pulp Fiction'. Quentin has clearly mastered the potentially disconcerting effect in these movies, using it to compensate to some degree for the incomplete story in this movie. There are other scenes where one wants to not even believe what they are seeing, as he shows scenes similar to the great James Cameron directed scene in `Aliens' where the little girl is threatened from behind by the queen alien, and it is by no means certain that hero Ripley will arrive in time for the rescue.The role and performance of Uma Thurman dominate this movie. A sign of this fact is in the credit crawl, where I spotted at least six (6) credits dedicated to the care and grooming of Ms. Thurman. Watching her in this movie gives ample justification to the opinion that when she appeared in a supporting role to Ben Affleck in `Paycheck', her talents were being wasted. Thurman and Tarantino seem to have sharpened her performance to as fine an edge as there is on the samurai swords so prominently featured in the fight scenes. Thurman's whole body plays an important part, even down to the anticipation one feels while we wait to see if she can move her paralyzed great toe and thereafter the rest of her atrophied legs. She looks every inch the part of the samurai warrior, trumping performances of Tomb Raiders, Charlies' Angels, and other female martial artists. Lucy Liu, Vivica Fox, and Daryl Hannah also give strong performances, although Hannah' `big scene' comes in `Volume 2'.Bill never actually appears on the screen in `Volume 1', and this is OK, as it holds something in reserve for `Volume 2'. Michael Madsen's character appears only briefly, to reappear and be dealt with in `Volume 2'. Tarantino, like Kubrick and Woody Allen, has a real talent for using music from other sources to nuance his scenes, but somehow, this does not work as well in `Volume 1' as it does in `Volume 2' or in `Pulp Fiction'. It may just be me, in that the music simply did not touch associations I could make with these selections. I also found the very odd `Matrix' style red / green dominated coloring more annoying in `Volume 1' than I did in `Volume 2'.The use of Japanese cartoon art in one of the scenes may seem oddly out of place to some viewers, but I think it really works in the very least, to tell the story of the main Japanese character and to hark back to the source of the story `The Bride' in a Japanese anime picture novel.`Kill Bill Volume 2' is more balanced with fewer strains on your ability to believe the action than this `Volume 1', but `Volume 1' improves after being seen together with `Volume 2'. If possible, do yourself a favor and watch the two movies together. They run to about four hours, and have absolutely no scenes where you may be tempted to check your watch.	5.0	Flawed Masterpiece. Better if you see the two together.	2004-08-12	4	2	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ABVX4O1Q0OW5B	Bob Anderson	Reading the other reviews leaves me thinking that I did not see the same movie. I fell asleep several times and kept checking the clock to see if the movie was almost over. Admittedly, I am not a fan of martial arts movies (I slept through most of Crouching Tiger as well) but I am a huge fan of Tarantino. This movie was everything that Pulp Fiction was not. It was boring, poorly written, badly acted and pointless. There is a difference between clever violence and mindless violence. Kill Bill reminded me too much of Natural Born Killers and not enough of Reservoir Dogs.I know that in any western, 40 bad guys can fire endless rounds at the hero and not hit him. That is suspension of belief. But when 40 samurai-trained warriors are beaten mano a mano by one person that is dispension of belief. This woman makes impossible leaps, seems to float in mid-air, barely breaks a sweat and never gets tired but has to struggle to climb up a balcony in the big fight scene. It's ridiculous.I understand that some of the action is meant to be overplayed but the movie lacks any depth to balance it out. You are tricked into thinking that there is a story behind the mayhem but there really isn't. If I didn't know that Tarantino wrote it, I would have guessed that someone was imitating him and doing a poor job of it. Again, I go back to Pulp Fiction. That was dialogue. That was a story. It had wit, humour and cleverness, none of which could be found in Kill Bill.Is it the lines or the people delivering them? Lucy Liu could not act her way out of a paper wall. Uma is good to look at but delivers every line with a woodenness many trees would envy. The other actors faired little better.Kill Bill now joins the ranks of Rushmore and Jackass as movies for which I want my money back. I could not say enough bad things about any of these three pieces of crap.	1.0	Did I miss something?	2004-07-17	29	12	17
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2BVQJ03F73ET6	"Bob A. Reiss ""Audiobook Reviews: The Guilded ..."	I found it interesting that Tarantino decided to tell part of this story in animated form. For a nice segment of this developing story of a bride, seemingly struck down on her wedding day, now out for revenge, Tarantino tells the story in traditional Japanese animation form, with plenty of blood and gore and outrageousness. Why I find this interesting is that the ensuing live action scenes are just as cartoonish as the animated scenes. Tarantino tells an outrageous story, using outrageous images in an incredible comic way that underscores the ultraviolent themes. When the bride attacks swiftly with her razor sharp blade separating man from limb the ensuing blood loss seems as realistic as Wile E. Coyote getting hit in the head with an anvil. Even the basic sceneries and colorings of the various sets and settings are cartoonish. Now, this isn't a criticism. Tarantino uses this format purposefully and brilliantly. His characters don;t seem too realistic, but that's fine because this isn't a tale of realism, this is as much a fantasy as the world of Middle Earth.	4.0	A Bloody Live Action Cartoon	2004-04-03	0	0	0

I finally saw it on cable and, just as with CTHD, I longed for a way to recapture those two wasted hours of my life.This is a highly stylized gore fest with the same disregard for physics, anatomy, and medical science as CTHD. Tarantino is an obviously disturbed individual who's managed to capture the attention of jaded moviegoers.His ability as a film maker is evident (I wish I could say the same of CTHD!), but his obsession with pushing as many audience buttons as possible shouldn't be confused with good film making. On the other hand, the Anime flashback sequence was well done, but then no one expects Anime to be in any way realistic. And that's the problem, this is live action Anime.That these movies (I'm assuming that Vol. 2 is more of the same) have been so popular speaks volumes about our society - and that's the most depressing thought of all."	2.0	"Well, at least it's better than ""Crouching Tiger..."""	2004-06-11	23	9	14

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3DM08AHYJHS0P	"""boxingelena2000"""	"Quentin Tarantino does not fail to amaze. How, oh how, does this film geek achieve such spectacular perfection on the silver screens? How can this blabbermouth, who can't stop showing off his extensive film knowledge, keep realizing his visions so beautifully on the screen? There have been quite a few influential auteurs/directors whose stylistic trends influenced generations of filmmaking; to my opinion, Tarantino ""the high school drop-out/video store clerk"" has already positioned himself amongst the classics. 'Reservoir Dogs', as a debut shot for less than $2 mil., are you kidding me? 'Pulp Fiction' has instantly achieved cult status, and I'm not going to delve into how nuanced and examplary this motion picture is...'Jackie Brown' remains the best Elmore Leonard adaptation, where Q.T. displayed his mature side, successfully keeping the audiences' attentions glued due to the intricacies of the plot. And now, after a mysterious 4-year disappearance which spawned off endless rumors as to Q.T.'s whereabouts (one of the rumors involved the director, depressed, smoking pot and watching B-movies this whole time), the man delivers again. ""Kill Bill"" (""Q.T.'s 4th movie"", as it's advertised - once again proof of the director's amazing substantiation in the highest rank of auteurs) is a representation of Tarantino's love for filmmaking - this film is ALL about style, and nothing but, and it does not dissapoint.Uma Thurman had her successful roles before (""Pulp Fiction"", ""Gattaca"", ""Hysterical Blindness"", ""Tape""), but this is clearly her finest hour yet - the film belongs to her, for she blends in perfectly with its flabbergasting energy, style and wit. Just like the movie, her character never comes off as funny, but rather as an extremely determined individual, sometimes to extreme measures.Yet the film is all extreme measures. Uma Thurman's Bride's existence was viciously shattered at her wedding, when her organization turns against her. She is shot, but stays alive to find Bill, and kill off her enemies in the process.Without revealing too much, that was the plot. How else to make it work but to incorporate it into a surreal anime/B-movie/Japanese homage bloody mess of a film, where the protagonist, along with all of her opponents, except Bill and future rivals in Vol. 2, are sexy young women who love to fight? Qunetin Tarantino's infatuation with filmmaking is evident from shot one, and you will know what I mean when you see it. As with 'Pulp Fiction', I am hesitant to delve into thorough discussion of all the subtleties that Taranitno inserts into ""Kill Bill"" without lessening the viewing interest of the reader.Constantly changing visual styles - from the aforementioned anime to grainy realism to black-and-white to a fairy snowiness of a backyard - each set is almost like a level that the protagonist has to pass, but what levels, and how she does it is portrayed unconventionally. Take the sequence where The Bride fights off dozens of samurai. With a custom-made Sonny Chiba sword, she majestically flies over them, as blood sprays in typically excessive amounts.Though it's all basically Quentin Tarantino's huge homage to either the numerous directors he loves or his own adoration for their work, ""Kill Bill"" astounds, and the main reason for that, apart from the relentless action, style and protagonist, is the fact that this film geek once again tops himself, despite the enormously high expectations after his three masterworks.P.S. Some argue Miramax's decision to cut the orginal four-and-a-bit hour version in half is unfortunate. I, personally, disagree - people saw Vol.1, there was mad gossip about how great it was, and now the anticipation of Vol. 2 is borderline unbearable."	5.0	Tarantino's Fourth Movie!!!	2003-12-01	2	0	2

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2AA00U9FO4UAC	Bradley J. Keusch	"Kill Bill vol. 1, the 4th feature from Quentin Tarantino, delivers in most every way that we would expect from Tarantino. It is sylish as hell; the cinematography especially struck me as being more impressive than in his previous films. The final scene particularly illustrates this, with the frenetic action being conveyed through silhoutte lighting, b&w vs. color and creative shifts between them, impressive camera shots such as the rising shot right before the battle royale, and the pure cinematic epicity of the setting of the final battle between Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu. Tarantino's brilliantly dark humor is littered throughout the film as well; Buck describing how to have sex with Uma Thurman's supposedly comatose form may be  offensive and appaling to some, but as it is delivered (and to all Tarantino fans), it is utterly hilarious (little details such as bucks ""P---- Wagon, the ""Kaboom!"" cereal box, and the water fountain that serves as the only noise through much of the climatic battle also stand out). I was also very impressed with(though initially apprehensive of) the anime segment that served as a segue into the Japanese setting, it added a surprising amount of emotion, and set the feel perfectly for the rest of the film. Nearly everything is done right, beyond right. The soundtrack is amazing, as is to be expected for a Tarantino film. He has impeccable taste in music, and seems to innately know what will enhance the film; in some places it is even cheesy (the 1,2,3,4s in the Japanese club) but we know that this is all intended, as is the ""Feature Presentation"" card at the beginning; Tarantino is someone who is obviosuly in love with film, and this film is almost an expression of love for all the ""cool"" films he watched growing up. I have heard Uma Thurman quoted as saying that this film is ""pure, epic, Tarantino fantasy"" and this is a perfect description of it. There is little to no depth, it is not a film that will stun you with its character development, or method acting, but it doesnt pretend to, or even want to. It simply revels in being the epitomy of ""cool"", it is an action film that is done in almost all ways, perfectly. Tarantino's gift is found in knowing what will look utterly amazing on film (again, I found myself stunned simply by the appearance of the final, snow-covered courtyard), in being able to write with a great amount of wit and intelligence, and  being able to put the two together with a large amount of what must be called genius. Kill Bill isn't Tarantino's best film (an honor reserved for the utterly brilliant Pulp Fiction, [or is it Reservoir Dogs, it seems to depend on which film ive watched most recently] ), nor will it win the Best Picture Academy Award (which it doesnt deserve anyway), but it is a damn good time. Uma Thurman makes a triumphant return to film, and shocks most everyone in being able to pull off her role as the Bride perfectly; after seeing the film I cannot imagine anyone who could be more convincing. The question remains, can a film be given 5 stars based on style alone? The answer, surprisingly, is yes. I give out 5 stars very, very infequently, to only the very best of films, and while this is by no means the BEST action film ever made, it is certainly a damn good one. repeat viewing may lessen the spectale somewhat, but this reviewer was very impressed (and still is, after 3 viewings) with what he just saw.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A229TMPRR70YPC	"Brendan Mchugh ""brendan2006"""	I saw this film for the first time last night and was...amazed! I have never seen a film like this. We all have heard about how great this movie was and I don't usually believe hype. I am so mad at my self that I put off seeing this movie for such a long time. I am infuriated with myself that I missed volume 2 as well. Now all I have to do is wait for the second half of this movie to come out on DVD. But, until then I will do just fine watching this fine movie. It has a bit of everything in it action, drama, witty dialogue, and (oh yeah I forgot to add the obvious) a whole lot of blood! Uma Thurman was absolutley amazing and I hope she gets an Academey Award for Kill Bill Volume 2 since she was snubbed for Kill Bill Volume 1. The supporting cast was also great; Lucy Liu suprised me greatly. I do not know why,she just did. I loved the music for this film. It was a key factor that made this film enjoyable or set the mood or whatever. But the most credit should go to Quentin Tarintino. I think the man is a little wacky publicly,but he is a genius of a film-director. He is up there with Alfred Hitchcock in the level of genius. I absolutley loved this film and you would not regret seeing this film. Heck, you might as well buy it!	5.0	And the verdict is: Amazing!	2004-06-12	4	1	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3PXHENWX4ODCZ	"bridget. ""unexplained robot"""	I was cynical towards this movie from the first time I saw the original trailers. I had been a fan of Quentin Tarantino in the past, but my dislike for Uma Thurman and the way the movie was portrayed in the trailers really turned me off. Then, last week, I found myself in the video store, trying to search for something to rent. In my eyeline I find Kill Bill Vol. 1 and decide to give it a chance. I am immensely glad that I did!Story-wise, the movie was not very interesting. I found myself completely uninterested in what happened to The Bride and why and how these villains were related to her. The only bit of storytelling I enjoyed was the history of O-Ren. Some reviewers have commented on the &quot;nonsense&quot; of certain story aspects (such as The Bride living at all or being able to carry a samurai sword on the plane) - how could Quentin make it more clear that the movie is not meant to be true-to-life? Pick up your average Bruce Lee (or even Jackie Chan) movie and you'll find that the entire point of a movie like this is that the main character can get rid of 50+ people without breaking a sweat. That's the beauty of it.Kill Bill is about the action. The beautiful martial arts and battle scenes in this movie stunned me silent. Completely in awe from the first scene between Uma Thurman & Vivica A. Fox - probably one of the best opening scenes of a movie ever written.There are some downsides. Lucy Liu just cannot act, and should not have been cast for the role of O-Ren. She was only interesting in anime form and not at all convincing or threatening. Thankfully, this was balanced by the amazing work of Uma Thurman, whom I have never liked previously.The bottom line is if you can't handle violence (and this is artistic violence), then you shouldn't watch the movie. If you can't handle violence in film, you shouldn't be watching a Quentin Tarantino movie in the first place. But if you enjoy artistic violence and martial arts, this movie is chocolate for the eyes. I can't wait to own it and watch it over & over again.	4.0	I am converted.	2004-07-20	1	1	0

There is an amazing animated sequence which is fantastic.  However, this movie is not for everyone.  It is violent, but most of the violence is so over the top (as it is intended) that it is comical.  This is one of the best movies this year.  It is well worth the $9.

I'm not a prudish person: I'm all in favor of violence that is reasonable and enhances a movie (eg. soldiers in a combat zone getting blown up). By contrast, the violence in this film is grotesque, unbelievable, and serves no particular function. The plot could be summarized without loss on an average-size napkin (woman gets beaten up and raped, recovers, and travels the world slaughtering members of the responsible gang).That this movie has been (and continues to be) so enormously popular is a frightening testament to both the herd mentality that prevails amongst movie-watchers and our society's numbness to gore and brutality.

The blood in this was great no not great outstanding along with the action sequences. The ending sequence was non-stop fight. It's either kill or be killed and this movie proves it. The music was great along with the film. The story goes like this: Uma Thurman (code name: Black Mambo) is about to get married in El Paso, Texas, but gets shot down by her soon to be hubby Bill and 4 of his Viper Assasins. Uma wakes up 4 years later out of a coma and gets revenge on all those her almost killed her. First on the list is O-Ren-Shii, but you don't see that scene to the very end first you see V. Green at her home get killed. Then Uma gets some of the best japanese steel from a retired sword maker and goes after O-Ren-Shii or whatever her name is and kills all her crew. Uma only kills the two in this film and the rest I suppose in Vol. 2 or maybe even a Vol. 3 I hope. The movie is so fast paced (exciting) that you won't believe it's been 1 hr and 50 mins when it comes to a finish. This is one of years best films along with Vol. 2 even though I haven't seen it.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3HTX1NOTTWERP	Busy Body	One of the greatest films of the past year has to be Quentin Tarantino's epic &quot;Kill Bill - Volume 1.&quot; Proudly dubbed as 'The 4th Film By Quentin Tarantino,' the film is both a masterpiece is modern day action cinema and also in popular culture associations. By blending many themes and genres, Tarantino creates one of the most exciting and enjoyable films of the past decade. A film that breaks new ground and raises the bar for future action films whilst simultaneously giving birth to an icon in the form of The Bride.In the early 1990's Tarantino reigned supreme as the ultimate director of pop culture smashes. &quot;Reservoir Dogs,&quot; &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; made him the hottest man to work with, and even though he only made three films in the space of this decade, he certainly changed the 90's. I was too young to witness any of these movies being only a youngster at the time, but as 2003 rolled on, I knew I had to see his fourth film. Just something about the trailer made it a must-see. Maybe it was the settings? The dialogue? The costumes? The overpour of blood, contrasted with the yellow of The Bride's jumpsuit? Whatever the reason, I knew this would be a good film...In &quot;Kill Bill - Volume 1,&quot; Uma Thurman stars as The Bride (real name 'unknown') who is on a non-stop, blood-thirsty killing spree of revenge to claim justice on the people who left her for dead four and a half years previously. The Bride was once a loyal member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DIVAS) of which Bill (David Carradine) was the boss. She was previously known as Black Mamba and decided she wanted to leave to start a family and get married. Bill didn't take too kindly to this, and on the day of her wedding, Bill sent four of his top murderers to dispatch of her. They nearly succeeded in their quest, slaughtering all the guests. However, The Bride survived and lay in a coma for four and a half years, until she woke up, and - realising she had lost her child - sets out to exact her revenge on all those who tried to kill her off.This is where the film truly begins, but one must take into account that the film is sliced up into five different sections, all muddled up, which makes it a difficult film to follow in terms of sequencing. After your first viewing though, you'll get a grip of it. Uma Thurman pulls off her role as The Bride exceptionally well and you get a real sense of authenticity portrayed through her character. Helping her on her quest around the world for revenge is the Samurai sword expert Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba). This character brings about the oriental feel to the film, and also humor through his bickering with his annoying assistant. The first scene we witness is the killing of Vernita Green aka Copperhead (Vivica Fox) in her home, kitchen utensils and all. It's a fantastic scene and the gruesome display of blood is shockingly realistic, preparing the viewer for the real action that is to happen. There's also the fantastic scene between The Bride in her comatose state of mind when the evil nurse, Elle Driver, aka California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah) proceeds to inject her in one of the most brilliant scenes of the film. Then there's the gruesome scenes between Buck (Michael Bowen) and a welcome return from Michael Madsen as Budd, aka Sidewinder.Under Bill are killers like O-Ren Ishii, aka Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu), whose introduction, via the Japanese Animation, was great. After this we see one of the greatest scenes of the entire film after about an hour when Cottonmouth dispatches of Boss Tanaka (Jun Kunimura) who works on her team. He questions her Chinese/American heritage and is unhappy about a female boss leader, and the speech she delivers after his beheading is truly a classic! Under Cottonmouth is her personal assistant, lawyer and translator, Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus), who was present at the slaughtering of The Bride. When The Bride sees Sofie once again, she is pretty bitter about what Sofie let have happen to her. What we hear has happened to Sofie at the hands of The Bride is truly unbelievable.Another of Cottonmouth's women is a little girl, Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), who is more deadly than she looks. Her school girl sound and look is very interesting, while her confrontation with The Bride highly entertaining and definitely one of the highlights of the entire film! The violence is at a real high here and the ball-and-chain moments are truly tense. The final demise of Cottonmouth is truly spectacular in the Japanese garden, decorated with snow and feeling very authentic and representative of the popular culture of Western martial arts flicks. The fight scenes just before this with Cottonmouth's company of masked men is truly amazing too, but the scenes of black and white are a big disappointment. I know they had to be censored because of violence, but it still takes away from the overall brilliance of the film.OVERALL GRADE: 10/10Overall Kill Bill - Volume 1 is one of the best films I think that I have ever seen. It was definitely the best film of 2003, only overshadowed by The Return Of The King! People are moaning about this film containing too much violence. These are obviously the conservative losers of Middle America who think that violence doesn't exist! We live in a world filled with it! God knows everyone knows it in the current world we live in...People need to stop thinking of this film as trashy, because it is anything but! The film itself is based on old martial arts film and obviously incorporates that cheesy factor, but this only adds to its brilliance. Quentin certainly knows how to make his money as this film was originally going to be a 3 hour long epic, but he decided to split it in two! Therefore, he makes twice as much money at the box office and on DVD sales. He's not stupid! Look out for a Box Set of Volume 1 and Volume 2 some time this year with tons of special features. There isn't many on this release for a reason! The Soundtrack is also excellent, but that's another review for another time...	5.0	Here Comes The Bride!	2004-05-23	3	1	2

Before you mouseclick that ""wasn't helpful"" button out of fan reflex, I'll try to be as brief as possible:1. Cardboard characters: face it, the characters in this movie have about as much dimension as Teletubbies. At times, they seem to be mere mouthpieces, designed for the singular purpose of performing Tarantino's oh-so-clever dialogue---which, incidentally, ain't that clever.2. Bad, overly self-conscious and smarmy dialogue: seriously, I've read better dialogue in Stephen King novels. ""Silly Rabbit,"" Lucy Lu quips in one scene. ""Tricks or for kids,"" replies Uma Thurman, in whispered call and response. In the middle of the crucial and climactic fight scene, no less. Is this supposed to be funny? I can't imagine anyone ever snickering at this---except maybe a lobotomy victim.3. Too self-referential. The scrambled chronology worked in Pulp Fiction. Here it seems not only unneccessary, but verging on self-plagiarism. I love cinematic experimentation, but French new wave this is not. Put the scenes in order and you have a fairly typical and tepid action film.4. An incomplete experience. Together, the films work to be a three-star piece of cinema; an interesting spectacle, but still leaving the viewer dissatisfied. Severed from its counterpart, Kill Bill seems amputated and incomplete.There were some elements to praise in this film---as many of you have rightfully pointed out---but alone they are not enough to merit even calling this a good film. Fair to middling, and that's about it."	2.0	Eyecandy: nothing more and nothing less	2004-08-14	10	4	6

It has all of his trademark dark humor and originality throughout the whole movie.Uma Thurman was wonderful as the nameless Bride and all of her counterparts were all equally great as people who 'deserved to get whacked.'The action scenes might be the main draw of this movie but the best part of it for me was the music. Each tune and song was catchy and fit the scene to perfection.

This is another Quentin Tarantino tribute to his own overdone &quot;style&quot; and gratuitously violent, intellectually stunted, and generally meaningless caricature (literally and figuratively) of the old revenge story.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1KM6DAGBWLQ1M	Casey	With Quentin Tarantino you cannot tell whether you will like his movies or not care for them. I saw every Quentin picture and I can honestly say that their is a mixed sense for me.Reservor Dogs was alright, but I didn't particularly care for it, Pulp Fiction was a masterpiece which in my mind is the greatest action movie of all time, Jackie Brown which was a slight letdown from &quot;Pulp&quot;, but satisfying for Quentin fans and a damn good follow-up to the masterpiece, and last Kill Bill Vol.1 &amp; 2, both of which I thought along with my friends and fellow Quentin fans thought was a very good picture. This movie starring Uma Thurman, Michael Madsen, Lucy Liu, Darryl Hannah, Vivica A. Fox, and David Carradine as &quot;Bill&quot;. These two movies balanca out the sets of actors in each of the movie and make for a great movie experience for both fans. The first one, in my and many peoples opinions thought was better. If you like action packed bloody movies rather than explanitory movies you will prefer 1 to 2. In 1 you will get the raw action, while in 2 you get the glimpse of the moments leading up to them.Some may love this movie, and some may hate this movie, but either way you must respect Quentin Tarantinos vision and bravery in releasing movies that everyone might not like, and shows just who his fans really are.	5.0	An essential for &quot;Pulp&quot; fans	2004-05-05	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A37HCSGGRH8UO6	"C. Conard ""ExtremeAvalanche"""	Kill Bill continues the great tradition of great movies directed by the legendary Quentin Tarantino. And like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill is overdone, glamourous, and is a terrific, violent, convoluted film! Kill Bill seems like it is a bit too simple of a plot for Tarantino. A female assassin is betrayed, nearly killed, and four years later, she is out to seek revenge against her former compatriots, and the people who put her through hell. The big thing that I couldn't figure out was whether it was supposed to be a witty, sarcastic film with lots and lots of blood, or if it was supposed to be a dark, gritty film with lotts and lots of blood. I decided that it was a little bit of both. After all, Tarantino did direct it, and in his world, nothing is what it seems. As I said earlier, the film is quite convoluted and full of surprises, at least for an action film. Kill Bill is a daring film, and it draws in elements from many different films. For example, if you pay close attention, any fan will realize that the beginning of the film is similar to 60's karate films. Above everything else, Kill Bill is sheer fun and a great movie to see. It is very artistic as well. For example, the movie incorporates black and white, anime, and regular color presentation in one sequence. And it is hard to believe that a movie with this much blood can be artistic, but believe me, it is! It is the best movie to come out this year, and kicks off a great fall season of films after a lackluster summer. Kill Bill is colorful, and almost groovy in some ways. Think Austin Powers with suffering and gore, and you'll get the picture. Uma Thurman does a gritty but excellent job in this film, and Lucy Liu manages to shake off some of her Charlie's Angels reputation that classified her as a poor actress. Kill Bill is a stylized, colorful, gritty, elemental movie, and anyone with a strong stomach should definitely see it.	5.0	Good to be Bad!	2003-10-14	233	170	63

I thought she was going to kill him too. Instead she...- For instance, another scene where Uma was fiercely fighting with a brown woman when her child came back from school. Then the two stopped fighting and talked gently to the kid.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2A3POOV4WOL8W	Chan Yiu Kee	Could be read as a story of a mother eliminating all the bad stuff coming from the father [as dramatized by the killings of all the bad guys, and eventually the ultimate one, Bill, or Bill the father] and ending up in a &quot;happy&quot; fatherless mother-daughter dyad [though both trapped in their gaze at the TV, the virtual world; in the very last scene of Vol 2].Father is depicted as the seeds of all violence, and mother only as the victim-turned-killer-finally-mother.However, needless to say, without the father, without the man, there could not be any conception, or children.This glorification of women, to the extent of annihilating men, is a doomed &quot;solution&quot; to the perpetual men-women conflict [Kill men after getting his 'seeds', and women will be happy]. Even the child here is a daughter, not a boy.A happy family, if we still believe in such a thing as a happy family, should be a dialectic and delicate balance between the maleness and femaleness of the couple; neither one should eliminate the other.It is not that only women is the source of life, men is the necessary other.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A21SK111940P37	Christian Grevstad	"In my opinion Kill Bill Vol.1 manages to be pompous, pretentious, fetishistic, sadistic, clich&egrave;d, uncool and overlong.SADISTIC in the way Tarantino uses violence; which is disturbing in a way that is reminiscient of horror directors such as Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci -completely unproblematized. It is a way of glorifying human suffering that can only be defended by denying any connection between film and reality. Large parts of the films violence is higly realistic and Tarantino mercilessly lingers on the sufferings of human beings, in a way that is absolutely devoid of broader implications -unlike for instance Gaspar Noes ""Irreverible"", which problemitized the tali&ograve;n-principle(an eye for an eye). Horrificly, Tarantino does everything in his power to create violent scenes as gruesome as possible (twice mothers are killed in front of their children) and uses cinematic devices to make the viewer take pleasure in it, and without making him or her feel quilty about it. It`s ""Baise Moi"" with flare. And also a naive homage to exploitation, not a critique of it.CLICH&Egrave;D in a way that makes the script seem like it was written by a thirteen year old, when in fact it`s by a 44 year old teenager.UNCOOL in a way that would make the the wachowsky brothers proud.OVERLONG in 95 minutes is quit a feat. In a way the film really was divided in two for artistic reasons: The self absorbed Tarantino can`t stand to cut any of his images out -no matter for how long they drag on in all their uninspiredness. Thus a 20 minute sequence that does nothing to further the ""story"" and takes comodity fetishism to the point of exhaustion, is left in. Any slightly self critical director would have cut it, along with other sequences.Sure, the film is technically brilliant, but form is an expression of content. There is no deliberate content in Kill Bill, other than its implicit detructiveness."	1.0	Don`t Belive the Hype	2003-10-29	74	32	42
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3IY28PW12MSVN	Christine Wong	"This is an incredible movie - smart, witty, sexy, sharp, and beautiful all at the same time.  There are some gripes about this story not having a story, which is totally not true.  The plot revolves around The Bride (a superb Uma Thurman), who was shot and left for dead during her wedding.  ""Kill Bill"" tracks her revenge on two of the five assassins: Vernita Green (Vivica Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu, who totally redeems herself for her two mindless ""Charlie's Angels"" movies).  This is a pure revenge film, but a wonderful and visually fantastic set-up for Volume 2, which develops the story even more and fleshes out its characters.Still, even if Volume 1 just shows Uma Thurman getting her revenge on her assassins, it's a great film.  Quentin Tarantino, a master of technique, uses his knowledge of 1970s Shaw Brothers Hong Kong kung-fu movies to create a beautiful work of art.  It isn't meant to be realistic; it's meant to be extraordinary.  The fight scenes are over-the-top and the fruit-punch blood spurts like geysers but this movie isn't really ""violent,"" per say.  It's so unrealistic (in a good way) that it's ironic, satirical, and funny.  Tarantino's style pokes fun at, celebrates, and transcends the kung-fu movies.  His writing is also often quirky, colorful, funny, and sometimes dead serious.  It's a lovely combination.If you want more examples of Tarantino's total dedication to his work, look at where he chooses to set his scenes and what kind of music he picks.  Just because the movie is violent doesn't mean that Tarantino doesn't have a sense of beauty.  He knows what he's doing, and one only needs to look at his use of an elegant, quiet, snow-covered garden for O-Ren Ishii and the Bride's final fight.  There is also an incredibly moving and exciting anime sequence in the movie.  Also, the use of the MUSIC is absolutely incredible, and one of my favorite aspects of this movie.  I can't say enough good things about it.  In one scene where O-Ren is being driven to the restaurant, the trumpets in the background music perfectly match the light that passes on O-Ren's face.  Everything is timed so perfectly.  Music is so important to this movie; you'll feel your adrenaline go right up just hearing it.  It's really that good.There is great acting in this movie...I can't think of a single character that didn't intrigue me.  To single a few of them out, though: Uma Thurman gives an amazing performance.  I loved how she could alternate from being funny, sexy, serious, charming, and deadly so easily...  She kicks major butt in this movie, but she isn't exactly just a stereotypical, generic, tough action girl.  There's a real brain and a real heart behind her character.  Also, Lucy Liu (O-Ren Ishii) is so good in this movie, I personally think Tarantino should make another movie just about her.  She is a character so rich and so complex, it would be a travesty to just call her only a ""villain"" or ""The Bride's adversary.""  And besides, some of the best scenes in ""Kill Bill"" featured O-Ren Ishii and her posse.  My personal favorite character in ""Kill Bill"" has got to be Gogo Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), O-Ren's teenage bodyguard.  Kuriyama plays Gogo with fun menace...I loved the fact that she was young, beautiful, and crazy.  Just watch her in the few scenes she has...she just oozes coolness.  It's that combination of the school-girl outfit, smallish stature, youngish face, long straight black hair, and beautiful deadly eyes that is just awesome.  Suffice to say, I also think Tarantino should make another movie about Gogo, too.  Heck...most of the main characters are so awesome and complex that Tarantino could make another movie out of any of them.  It's a testament to the strength of Tarantino's writing.""Kill Bill"" is one entertaining, beautiful, smart, exciting visual bonanza.  Don't pay too much attention to the people who gripe about the lack of story and excessive violence.  Whatever it may be, Tarantino has presented pure storytelling at its finest.  10/10"	5.0	In a word - WOW!!	2005-06-10	6	6	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1IPP4XVTCMSV8	"Christopher Bailey ""pcboy56"""	The title of this review expresses both my expectations for this movie and the expectations of many people who I know.  In the end, I am shocked because I definitely did NOT like it.  I'd like to share my experience so that you can better judge whether this movie is for you, not because I wish to demean it.I love martial arts.  I usually like martial arts films, especially in the rare instances where you can use fighting effectively without completely sacrificing plot...Heck, even an attempt at plot. (Now THAT's a parody of the genre - something this movie was hailed as by some but failed to live up to.)  Thus, when several people who know me and my martial preoccupation recommended this movie very highly, it began to sound like a sure hit.  Indeed, it has all the makings of such a hit, employing many an action and/or kung fu clich&eacute; as it winds its way along.Alright, I'm going to start with the good, because I don't want it to seem that I'm laying into this movie without having thought about it.1. Quentin Tarentino clearly has a good handle on what makes film visually interesting.  He employs anime-styled animation, black and white, and uses color contrast to maintain variety and keep things appealing to the eye.  (Note the yellow or white on red contrast in this film used repeatedly.)  This helps keep your eyes on the screen for the most part.2. The sound quality is excellent, especially the choice in music.  Because the movie is nearly constantly in motion, the music appropriately beats along with an up-tempo rhythm and serves the movie well.  You may want to get up and bust out the glo-sticks, or you may just tap your foot subconsciously.  Either way, I thought the use of sounds also drove the movie.3. There's at least an attempt to justify the violence.Now, my complaints.1. There is simply too much gory violence for my taste, and the justification for it is weak.  I don't care if it's only bad people being killed.  I don't care if it's bad people killing bad people.  That aspect of the film didn't interest me and actually verged on bothering me.  The violence wasn't a fake, disconnected kind, and being dragged through 90-some murders isn't fun.2. Uma Thurman's acting felt bland, and Lucy Liu wasn't convincing.  Ultimately, the dialogue struck me as very poor, I guess.  It serves to move the viewer from one bloody encounter to the next and lend fragments of insight as to why everyone's fighting, but aside from that it's often unnatural sounding and uninteresting.  If I bought Ms. Thurman or Ms. Liu as &quot;tough&quot;, (a failing more of the script than their acting) maybe that wouldn't have been the case.  Perhaps then this movie might have transcended to &quot;cool&quot; status, but as such it's relegated to &quot;I Bought This Without Renting It?&quot; purgatory.3. A sword?  On a plane?  Yeah...Right...4. The choreography is simply nothing special, and that's coming from someone who likes martial arts.  If you don't like wire work, this isn't your movie certainly, because in typical Woo Ping fashion, it's abundant here.  Also, there are the typical high-arcing sword swings which are clearly intended to make clanging sword sounds for the camera rather than to injure an opponent.  Perhaps this complaint ultimately stems from not being able to relate to any of the characters, but I couldn't suspend my disbelief and found the action boring as a result.The above are really only building to this conclusion: It's sad to me that of all the things Tarantino chose to emphasize about martial arts, he chose to merely show it as violent.  And, ultimately what I got from this movie reflected just that - empty violence.  I couldn't buy the justification for it, and as such it mostly offended me.Your miles may vary.  As I tried to say, the visual and audio presentation of this movie make it quite &quot;watchable&quot; - an accomplishment of its own.  If you like other Tarantino films, you'll likely enjoy this, especially if martial arts or yakuza films also interest you.I can only say that the violence may also be a significant turn-off for others, and if you can't get past that, you'll likely start to look for flaws as I did above and enjoy it less.  I mean, other than violence, very little else happens in this movie, so just know what you're getting into and make your own choice.	2.0	I was SUPPOSED to like this movie.	2004-05-02	17	9	8

I kept waiting and waiting for things to work... but they never did.  The film has absolutely NO tension (in fact because the movie is told in Tarantino style out of order, we know that Lucy Liu's character has already been killed previous to that segment's beginning).  The main character is herself an assassin who murders a Vivica Fox's character, and then threatens her young daughter over the body... which is to say that The Bride is shown as a complete moral vacuum, who has NO standing for judgement of others.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1SLH2767WC1GR	"christopher wren ""christopher_wren"""	I love Pulp Fiction, and I possess a whole-heared admiration for Reservoir Dogs (a film utterly unappreciated for its frighteningly hard-line moral stance on its characters, who all pay in effectively repulsive ways).  I own many video and DVD manifestations of those films.  But Kill Bill I find repugnant.The very first shot in the film announces Tarantino's giddy, disturbing irresponsibility:  a lingering close-in of Uma Thurman bloodied, terrified, pathetic as an abused puppy, vulnerable and gored, panting out her gruesome defeat, while a smooth-talking thug spouts, off camera, his zen-a-la-slaughter thoughts on sadism.  Knowing she's about to be killed, Thurman desperately--horrifyingly, to be honest--says she's carrying the guy's baby--and then we see the spray of blood behind her head.  Roll titles, to tune of a hip, depressive song about a violently failed relationship.I could readily stop taking the film so seriously, except that it's foundational premise adamantly, indignantly instructs me to take it seriously.  Contemplate her last (we think) gesture, pitiably wasted on that tragically futile attempt to win mercy. My horror at her terror derives from the infinite ache that Tarantino makes her (really us, since he invented the thing to fill theaters) endure before he giggles &quot;Psyche!&quot; and makes his movie into the gushing cartoon it really is.  If the whole film is an honorific romp through karate-dom, this opener is inexcusable.  Uma's suffering is effectively real, genuinely involving, and repulsively, disgustingly, irrepresibly sadistic as a film invention for this dismissable genre.  Tarntino missed that point so badly; the films he's honoring are soap-operatic, superficially involving, and radically forgettable and forgivable.  They're also consistent in tone, even dreck like John Woo's Hard Target.So why this horrifying opening?  It's like spinning cotton candy on an unpicked femur.  You don't start kung-fu-on-helium with a shot like that.  That crucial shot contextualizes violence as something abhorrant, something we're greedy to escape, not greedy to behold.  Yet Kill Bill is never, at any point, The Pianist or Platoon or even Ordinary People.  It's not even Blade Runner, which values life-urge the way Uma supposedly does.  It is just a d@mned sword movie, guys, but the premise Tarantino concocts to impel Uma's revenge World Tour is one that Victor Hugo and Shakespeare and Homer--h#ll, even Leone and Kurasawa, Scorcese, even De Palma--gave potent meditation to, the crushing potency of spiritual and physical agony.  I fervently hope that first images, together with what Uma must face then and later, some of it on-screen, disturbed you.  A presumably dead baby (sure, it's alive, Tarantino's ironically gutless bow-down to decency, but he makes us suffer our own and Uma's certainty that it's been literally cut out of her), a suffering yet taunted woman, four years of constant rape, repugnant vaseline sight-gags, the emphasis on Passion of the Christ suffering--and then, hot dog!--a plot that treats all other human flesh like hydrants to tap for their edifying blood pressure!  What wretched inconsistency!  But on the other hand, oh, what intertitles, what colored flood-lighting, what small-cache songs so carefully chosen that Tarantino fatuously identifies them in the subtitles!  Maybe it's really not even about swords at all, but about Tarntino's CD and movie collection.  Or it's Lorenzo's Oil meets Adam West.  Or it's just the most indulgent, irresposible film since Pearl Harbor.  Should we pity Uma for her past or envy her for those fetching track suits?  I don't think Tarantino has a clue what he wants, except for an audience and a chance to work with Sonny Chiba.In the final scene, the extended fight at the Japanese inn, the film's sound design makes the bodies sound like fruit and sponges, and the shot composition places Uma inside chambers of well-tailored flesh; the men's bodies become the mere substance walling her in, and she hacks away heedlessly.  I can handle the blood sprays visually, but it gets so tedious, so uninventive.  That shot when Uma's finished, when she looks over the rail and tells them to leave their limbs--what an apt metaphor for Tarantino's screenplay, an unremitting field of chortling red sameness.  Many times her sword strokes assault the viewer, as she slices dudes (corpses-in-waiting) who appear between Uma and us, their backs filling the screen; WE then become Tarantino's target.  The zest and piquant bliss we are presumably meant to find in these Matrix meathouse follies hardly jives with the picture of genuine suffering that started the whole movie.  That opening shot is as strong an argument against the misuse of film violence as anything in Unforgiven, yet Tarantino simply changes Uma's clothes, rehabilitates her big toe, gets her a vulgar ride, and off she goes on her smiling, well-decored way.  Four years of zero dignity traded for popcorn pleasures and lethal schoolgirls. From Desdemona to &quot;follow the yellow cheese road&quot; in a jiff!Reviews praising the film for being feminist missed all the female suffering, all the vicious-and-then-dead females, the little girls who see their parents slaughtered, Uma's grief when she can't find her baby in her stomach, the rape, the vaseline (p-layed as a joke, of all things!), the name of the pick-up Uma has to drive, Bill's control over Uma's kid--over her motherhood--etc, etc, etc.  Ume gets revenge, you say.  Ok, but what kind of a person is she?  I don't mind that she's a violent character, but that's all she is.  She is just the violent one who wins.  She is a victorous, arbitrary woman.  And anyway, the opener makes us want to see her safe, not just revenged--that far lesser option.The scene that sums it all up occurs in the suburban house, when Uma and what's-her-hiss (who cares what purposely absurd snake-name Tarantino drew out of a terrarium for her) are interrupted by the little girl.  Our discomfort there--and I am sure he wants us to feel some--should be instructive.  Had Tarantino actually lowered the stakes in these painful scenes, he could have made a better film.	1.0	repugnant gloss	2004-05-19	32	12	20
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AERGIVLVUJAY4	"C. J Millett ""movie critic and buff"""	"Kill Bill Vol. 2 is the second half of Quentin Tarantino's epic tale of bloody revenge, or ""gory story"" as the Bride so matter-of-factly puts it, about an ex-assassin turned bride-to-be whose decision to leave the murder-for-hire business doesn't go over too well with her employer Bill (David Carradine) This film, as well as its predecessor, is Tarantino's love letter to the genres he loves, most notably the grindhouse kung-fu films of the 70's, and of course the spaghetti westerns made famous by Sergio Leone. Much of the soundtrack a stark El Paso landscapes bring to mind Leone's 1967 masterpiece The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly perhaps a bit too often. To viewers not familiar with the film it may seem overdone or, at the very least, like a joke that loses its punchline.Overall, what Tarantino has created is a shameless exercise in self-indulgence that seems too smart for its own good. In wanting to create depth to a story thats purpose is as direct and to the point as a punch in the face, much of the dialogue here seems artificial and sluggish. One of the film's low points occurs when Elle Driver (given little life by Daryl Hannah) meets with the wonderfully sympathetic Bud, one of the films few dynamic characters, to recover the Bride's custom made sword. In the scene, there is a conversation in which Bud questions the one-eyed blond vixen's feelings (""Which 'R' are you filled with: relief or regret?"") It is these type of unnecassary rants, often delievered by the actors in jerky undertones, that lack the zip and quirky lyricism that populates so much of Tarantino's work. Consequently, for reasons that go unexplained, Elle has decided to sabotage Bud who is killed by a Black Mamba cobra snake. It makes us wonder why we just sat through ten minutes of useless chatter. Maybe she was just greedy and wanted it all for herself, but why would she just kill the brother of a man she seems to have deep feelings for? I guess the point is not to look too deeply into it, after all, it's just a simple tale of revenge. However, it seems at times that Tarantino is trying too hard to give the film a respectible running-time (137 minutes) by hiding behind cliches and silly metaphors like the Superman reference delivered by Bill before the climactic showdown (which lasts all of about twenty seconds)With that being said, there are a few memorable moments in the film that have that trademark Tarantino-punch, which string together an otherwise uneven picture. The opening scene, flamboyantly titles the 'Massacre at Two Pines' (referring to the wedding chapel shootings that start this bloody revenge tale spinning) is a brilliant bit of choreography, particuarly in the set-up of the Bride's reunion with Bill, which is tragic and touching. The broken-hearted Bill delivers the great line, ""I've never been nice in my whole life, but I'll do my best to be sweet."" The scene is shot in black and white and,in close-up, we see the battle worn features of a man left with only one option as he sees it. It is in the life they both lead. Another wonderfully executed sequence occurs as Uma is being buried alive by Bud and his pint-sized, beer guzzling friend Ernie. Tarantino offers us a blank screen where we hear but do not see the Bride being buried. The scene is so perfectly claustrophobic and frightening, it gives us the feel for the utter horror of her situation.Walking out of Kill Bill Vol. 2 left me with a profound sense of confusion. Usually, after seeing a Tarantino film, I have no problem admitting that I have just seen a film that I enjoyed. And, fresh off a second viewing of Volume 1, I fully expected to see the same zip and distinctive craft here. Instead, what I witnessed was a movie made by a movie-lover who was willing to do whatever it took to satisfy his own interests and expectations."	3.0	A shameless exercise in self-indulgence	2004-08-13	8	4	4
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AYGP0RTENHVZO	"C. J. Schwartz ""Charlie :)"""	This is one of the best films out in years.  If you want to be totally entertained and like action films this is the one to see.  Uma Thurman leads a cast of great actors and actresses.  It is a tale of revenge, very graphic violence, BUT it does have lots of humour.  Alot of it I did not see the first time around.  But if you watch how the movie was made on the DVD you will see things you might have missed watching this intense filem.  I can't wait for Kill Bill 2 to come out.  I will defenitely buy it.  The director and producer deserve all credit they receive and more.  Lucy Liu from (Alley McBeal and Julie Ann Dreyfus from Jerry Seinfeld elspecially, you will not even recognize.  Lucy Liu is again her beautiful and talented self which we have seen before.  BUT Julie Ann Dreyfus is in a totally different role from Jerry Seinfeld.  You probably won't recognize her until the credits.  Uma Thurman should have been nomainated for Best Female Actress.  If not winning, then the competition was extra tough.  Once again, if you want excitement from beginning to end, See Bill 1.  My only warning is you will be beckoning for Kill Bill 2.  Enjoy.	5.0	Kill Bill 1	2004-06-14	3	1	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AZ5250G2U795I	C. K. Ogi	Kill Bill is one of the most inventive films we've seen in a long time.  The story itself isn't particularly ingenious (cut and dried...it's a tale of revenge), and there's nothing earth shattering in the stories contruction.  Tarantino has, inexplicably, created a truly great work by paying 'homage' to his influences.Kill Bill is, at heart, nothing more than a tale of revenge.  The Bride (Uma Thurman, in a career-best performance), seeks to kill those who left her for dead during her wedding rehearsal, where the other members of her wedding party were killed.  She knows who the perpetrators are:  Her old Boss, Bill, and the team of assassins he lead.  The story is simply the Bride settling her business with those who left her for dead.But, Tarantino has managed to somehow weave together Kung Fu Movies, exploitation flicks, and Anime into a truly engaging work that managed to humanize very inhumane people.  He manages to eek surprisingly nuanced performances that don't shy away from hiding the characters flaws.  Lucy Liu, as the former assassin turned Japanese Crime Boss, gives a truly bone-chilling performance, as she personfies Asian sweetness with the steel heart of a killer.  (I won't be question her heritage anytime soon, I can tell you that!)The film IS violent...but the blood and gore you've heard so much about is very cartoonish to the point of not having much realism to it.  Tarantino wisely handles the most gruesome scenes (The tale of Oren is handled brilliantlly when her tortured past is done through Anime...giving a potentially repugnant scene the right amount of distance so as not to be horrified) with standard 70's flick-tricks. (The fight scenes at the restaurant are done wisely in black and white, so the overwhelming Red isn't overpowering and doesn't detract from the tale)  The voilence is heavy...but handled in such a way as to not feel as overburdened as one might expect.However, violence aside, this is a fantastic film.  It sets up a world where Revenge is honor.  Where fights are dances between wills.  Where martial arts can blend nicely with spaghetti westerns and 70's exploitation flicks and pay homage while creating their own new genre.  It's a fun flick that sets up for the story laid out more fully in Kill Bill 2. (which is a necessary companion to KB2 only in that if you really want to see the world that has shaped these characters, one needs to have this version)  Yes, I said Fun.  It's a charged up action packed full on MOVIE, and it paves the way nicely for the masterpiece that is KB2.My only reservation in recommending this is that you KNOW Mirimax will release both films and provide more extras in the merged versions, and THAT would be a great one to own.  However, this is such a good film and so very inventive that I can comfortably recommend it to tide you over until the full version comes out.	5.0	Tarantino creates a saga!	2004-09-08	3	1	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ATOS750XCC9MQ	Classis Genre Film Fanatic	The Film:I just saw this movie for the first time on DVD. As a whole, this movie has amazing cinematography and creativity. It's a cool homage to old spaghetti westerns, Japanese samurai, anime, etc. I borrowed it from a friend, but I can see myself owning it since I like those kinds of films with over the top violence. You can't take it too seriously, because it's not done realistically, and it's fake from the get-go. That's part of its charm.On the other hand, Quentin Tarantino tends to use overly crass subject matter and language just for the sake of being crass. Fans of Tarantino would probably say, &quot;What do you expect? It's Quentin Tarantino!&quot; But I say, why is it needed? This movie was already good, and stuff like that doesn't enhance the plot. I don't mind movies that have some language and/or crass subject matter if it's done tastefully and at a bare minimum. But the way Tarantino does it is just jarring. It stops the movie and prevents the plot from moving forward when it should. There's just too much language at times(and it's always the worst words used), and that scene with the two guys either raping or wanting to rape Black Mamba while she was in a coma is just sick. Granted, they didn't show anything (thank God), but their choice of words during that dialog that went on between them was just unsettling and it's something I'd rather not hear about. The subject is crass on its own, so it didn't even need that 5 minute bit of dialog with them talking about it. I have yet to find a good reason for that scene to even be there. It didn't enhance the plot at all. I'm absolutely positive that this scene, as well as most of the language could've been omitted and the film would've still be great(probably better). Scenes like this, and over the top bad language insult my intelligence. The movie is perfectly fine without all that. Sorry if I have morals (actually, I'm not sorry), but some things are just better left out.Thankfully, most of the crude language and subject matter was gone after that, and we got a magnificent blood bath of a movie with excellent choreograpy for the fight scenes, wonderful cinematography, and fun homages to Japanese samurai movies, anime, spaghetti westerns, etc. The plot was clever and witty when the movie actually focused on the plot.The DVD:The film had a good sharp picture. The sound was well balanced too. However the special features are very lacking. I suppose that's because there's a special edition coming out in the near future or something. The behind the scenes documentary on the making of the film was informative, but not much more than Quentin Tarantino and his big ego yapping away at how &quot;good&quot; he is. The 5,6,6,8s &quot;music&quot; video was crappy. They're a crappy band that works for the mood of the film, but they're not enjoyable for a special feature that soley focuses on them.Good movie, Okay DVD.	3.0	Decent movie, ok DVD	2004-06-04	8	4	4
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ACKGKHESX5PGC	Clay Chastain	Quentin Tarantino established himself as one the greatest directors of our (if not all) time with Pulp Fiction, a sleep hit from 1994. His quick witted, realistic dialogue showed us that not only does one not need a writing class to be good, but it's probably better never even to think of attending one. Now, with that said, we look at Kill Bill Volume One. Here, his trademark dialogue isn't present, but what is present is Tarantino's encyclopedic knowledge of Grindhouse cinema. When I saw it in the theaters, no one knew what the Shaw Brothers emblem at the beginning was, but I didn't care. Uma Thurman is sometimes scary, sometimes touching, and the two emotions blended together make this, I think, a potentially better epic than the Man with No Name trilogy. Tarantino's influences are here more than ever, and once again he pulls some terrific and memorable performances from the actors. The film is beautifully shot, and the story telling is out of this atmosphere. The teaser ending has left me waiting for Volume Two, and I'll be right there waiting for it.	5.0	Tarantino's Outstanding Grindhouse Epic	2003-11-10	2	0	2

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1DNQK8JS8QXB9	"Cliff Shelton ""When I say run, RUN!"""	I have to tell you all, last night I saw the biggest, baddest, most incredibly violent, funny and way-out there B-movie ever.I'm talking, of course, about Kill Bill.Brilliant, raw, visceral stuff. Quentin Tarantino's back in a big way. The film is an amalgamation of spaghetti westerns, chop-socky Kung-Fu movies, revenge movies, anime, you name it; Quentin's thrown it all in a blender and come out with this, the most eye-popping (literally!) movie of the year.Kill Bill (vol.1) is also amazingly shot and edited. There are so many intense scenes you often find yourself a bit breathless; then Quentin slows things down and there are quiet moments in between. The color palette he uses veers wildly from day-glo orange to muted blues, and everything in between. Nice, nice stuff. The only problem I really, honestly have with the film is the 10-minute anime sequence right in the middle. It feels gratituous and overly-long, and for me is the film's only detriment, albeit a very minor one.Then of course..there's the fighting!I don't think you'll have ever seen movie fighting like this. Check out the incredibly intense, knock-down drag-out fight near the beginning between The Bride (Uma Thurman) and Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox). You can't help but think they're actually beating the crap out of each other.Then, the final act of the film - The House of Blue Leaves - is breathtaking, mesmerizing, and the most insanely violent thing you'll ever have watched. It's so ridiculously OTT that you can't help but sit and wonder just how they pulled it off. Granted, it's in black and white - not color, as it will be overseas - but still amazing. However, and I mean this in the strongest possible way - this film is NOT for the squeamish. The blood flows like water in this film, so people with weak stomachs beware.Did I mention the film has a toe-tapping soundtrack put together by the RZA of the Wu-Tang clan, and has everything from Nancy Sinatra to Zamfir, or that Daryl Hannah is brilliant as the one-eyed Elle Driver, and is whistling the creepiest tune you're likely to hear (from the 1968 film Twisted Nerve)? No? Well, then, I have only one more thing to say.Go and see it. You may love it; you may despise it; but it's certain you've never seen anything else like it.	5.0	Tarantino is back and badder than ever!	2003-10-13	4	1	3

Stunning execution of camera positioning &amp; filters, amazing fight scenes, choreographed by Yoen Wong Peng, who also brought the Matrix &amp; Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragons fights to life! &amp; the similarities show! In my opinion its the closest thing to a live action manga/anime brought to life, with alot of hong kong influences throughout, the execution of it all, despite what some say, is amazingly original.Tarantino again, goes against the increasingly dull rules of hollywood cinema &amp; proves to true fans of film new &amp; old, that visionary film making aint dead!!

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"Self-proclaimed film geek Quentin Tarantino has had the idea for Kill Bill since the days of Pulp Fiction. So he finally releases his film, split up into 2 halves, either for money reasons or for length(I'd say both). And you're watching it with almost a sense of parlor game: was that a shot from an old japanese movie? Isn't that split screen a Brian de Palma thing? And yet the film entertains despite the fact there's many things that you would think would stop you from being entertained.The plot of the film and the second can accurately be described in one sentence: a woman and several others are killed during a wedding rehearsal only she's not dead and she vows revenge on those that did her in. That's it. You're not going to get any more complicated than that. What fills in the film and the second one is how she's going to accomplish it. Whether it's through getting a sword made by a legendary swordmaker or getting training from a cruel teacher(seen in part 2).The film does contain many memorable moments. There's that big long shot as we follow Uma into the washroom then follow 2 people down a hallway then into the main hall then follow a different woman back into the washroom in a single take. There's that beautiful snow garden at the end, and the anime sequence which goes into detail about one of the assassins(and oddly enough, the only one of 4 assassins to get anything resembling a backstory).As usual, Quentin doesn't like to follow typical storytelling laws. Reservoir Dogs was in flashbacks and Pulp Fiction was told out of order. Here it's divided into chapters. So we open the film with the Bride getting her would-be fatal bullet, then we fight one of the assassins in the home which actually took place after the assassin at the end of the film. And it would make sense since the first assassin is more movie-like in it's grandeur than a simple house fight.One problem is that there's parts where it just seems like they're really piling on ""the cool"". Many of the famous and oft-quoted lines from Pulp Fiction were just general conversations like the royale with cheese line and even the ""say what again!"" part. Here the whole thing about the Trix rabbit line just seems to be put there for no particular reason but to be a little pop culture-y in the film.I'd like to recommend the film because it does entertain if you can get past certain issues but be warned: most likely there's going to be a Super Duper Special Ultra Edition someday with both movies edited into one big long epic with extra bonus stuff instead of what we do get(oooh, a concert by that annoying japanese surf-pop group in the film, what fun!). But still, it's a film made by a guy who knows his stuff, just doesn't know how to make it his own."	4.0	Either it's a tribute to film genres or the biggest copying job I've seen	2005-08-06	2	1	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A24XAFHKD0NT28	cloud_mcaeris	THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST, MOST UNREALISTIC MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN. I DEMAND SCRUPULOUS REALISM FROM ALL MOVIES I SEE, PARTICULARLY ACTION MOVIES. AND ALTHOUGH I HATE ACTION MOVIES, AND SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO GO SEE THIS ONE I'M GONNA REVIEW THIS ANYWAY BECAUSE REVIEWS OF GENRE FILMS COMING FROM NON-GENRE FANS ARE BY FAR THE MOST USEFUL SORT. AFTER ALL, IF I DON'T TELL PEOPLE THAT THEY WON'T LIKE THIS ACTION MOVIE IF THEY DON'T LIKE ACTION MOVIES, HOW WILL THEY EVER KNOW?  THIS MOVIE IS SIMPLY RIDICULOUSLY ACTION PACKED. I'M PRETTY SURE THAT THERE ISN'T A SINGLE SECOND IN THIS FILM THAT DOESN'T CONTAIN VIOLENCE. WHO WOULD IMAGINE THAT AN ACTION MOVIE WOULD CONTAIN SO MUCH ACTION? NOT ME, AND I DOUBT THAT ANY WHO ACTUALLY SEES AND ENJOYS ACTION MOVIE ACTUALLY ENJOYS THE ACTION IN THEM, AND WOULD IN FACT PREFER THAT THEY CONTAIN A GREAT QUANTITY OF IT.  AND IT'S ABSURDLY GOREY AND OFFENSIVE. THIS MOVIE SHOULD'VE BEEN NC-17, AND THE MPAA WAS SURELY BRIBED TO GIVE IT THE R RATING, AS NO REASONABLE ADULT COULD BELIEVE THAT THIS ACTUALLY DESERVED THE R, AND THAT THE VIOLENCE WAS SIMPLY PLAYFUL RIDICULOUS AND CARTOONISH. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT GORE IS INHERENTLY VERY OFFENSIVE, AND IS FAR WORSE THAN SIMPLY PORTRAYING VIOLENCE IN GENERAL. IF YOU EVER HAVE TO MURDER SOMEONE IN THE REAL WORLD I PLEAD WITH YOU TO POISON THEM OR SUFFOCATE THEM OR KILL THEM IN SOME OTHER NON-GRAPHIC FASHION. WE WILL ALL BE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR THOUGTFULNESS.STILL, IT'S THE UNREALISM THAT REALLY BOTHERS ME. FOR EXAMPLE, HOW DID THE BRIDE TAKE THE SWORD ON THE PLANE? HOW? THIS COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN INTENTIONAL, AND WOULD'VE COMPLETELY RUINED THE MOVIE HAD IT NOT ALREADY SUCKED, EVEN THOUGH IT ONLY LASTED A FEW SECONDS. HOW DOES THE BRIDE SURVIVE BEING SHOT IN THE HEAD. IF ANYONE IN THE WORLD HAS EVER SURVIVED SEVERE HEAD TRAUMA MY NAME IS PHINEAS GAGE, WHICH IT AIN'T. THAT AND IF YOU WATCH CAREFULLY YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE WASN'T EVEN AN ENTRANCE WOUND. ARE WE TO BELEVE THAT HER BRAINS JUST BLASTED THEMSELVES OUT THE BACK OF HER HEAD. I DON'T THINK SO. AND HOW DID SHE KILL LIKE 50 GUYS AT ONCE, AND WHY DIDN'T ANYONE JUST STAB HER IN THE BACK, AND WHY DIDN'T A SINGLE PERSON IN A WHOLE DAMN YAKUZA CLAN NOT HAVE A GUN OF ANY SORT AND HOW COME THE POLICE NEVER SHOWED UP. SURE THOSE THINGS WOULD'VE INTERRUPTED THE ACTION AND FLOW OF THE MOVIE, BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALISTIC, AND TARANTINO AND ALL THE CRITICS OF THIS FILMS PROMISED THAT IT WOULD BE 100% REALISTIC. FURTHERMORE, SOME OF THE SCENES IN THIS MOVIE WERE IN BLACK AND WHITE AND OTHERS WERE ANIMATED.  THE REAL WORLD IS IN FULL COLOR, AND IS NEVER ANIMATED. SUCH UNREALISTIC DISCREPENCIES CANNOT BE IGNORED.  IT JUST GETS WORSE. UPON CLOSE INSPECTION, I REALIZED THAT THE FILM HAD ONLY 2 PHYSICAL DIMENSIONS, THUS MAKING IT ODDLY AND UNREALISTICALLY FLAT.  THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS AND UNBELIEVABLE.  NOT ONLY THAT I NOTICED THAT SOME OF THE SOUNDS MADE DURING THE FILM WERE ACTUALLY COMING FROM BEHIND ME OR TO THE SIDE, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ACTION ALL TOOK PLACE IN THE FRONT. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE. IT'S JUST ISN'T, SISTER. ALSO THIS MOVIE MOVED REPEATEDLY BACK AND FORTH IN TIME, WHICH IS, ONCE AGAIN, IMPOSSIBLE. IT'S ALMOST AS IF THIS MOVIE TOOK PLACE IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT UNIVERSE, WHICH IS JUST CRAZY.  AS IF ANYONE WOULD WANT TO GO TO A MOVIE THEATER TO SEE SOMETHING WEIRD OR EXCITING OR DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. NOT ME. INSTEAD SQUARE-ANTINO SHOULD'VE MADE A MOVIE OF ME RIDING A BUS AND THEN WORKING FOR 2 HOURS. THAT WOULD'VE BEEN EXCITING, INSIGHTFUL AND AMAZING, AND UTTERLY REALISTIC. BUT ALAS WE ARE LEFT WITH THIS WORTHLESS TRIPE, WHICH IS ONLY OF VALUE TO SUCH CONFUSED, MORONIC INDIVIDUALS WHO INSIST ON GOING TO THE MOVIES TO SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM THE REAL WORLD.	1.0	WHO DOES HE THINK HE'S FOOLING??

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A186AQVVKCANL5	clwinter	I had never really given Tarantino a shot until this movie which is a sin in most obsessed-Tarantino fans' eyes but I have to say after watching this one I went back and completed my Tarantino education.Kill Bill Vol. 1 is the first half of what is really one long movie cut in two. It centers on the story of The Bride, an assassin who is gunned down by her former boss and lover. Unfortunately for him and his Deadly Viper Assassination Squad she survives and goes on a revenge-seeking, blood squirting, samauri sword fighting rampage that leaves barely any one alive.Uma Thurman gives a great performance as The Bride and is not a just a pretty girl kicking some major ass but also an emotional woman who has lost her baby determined to do justice. Lucy Lui, Darrel Hannah and David Carradine also give great performances.This is not a movie for the faint of heart, that is for sure. There are limbs flying, blood squirting and gruesome killings that would make most people squirmish. But these scenes are done artfully with full attribute to the samaurai movies that inspired them. It makes the viewer appreciate Tarantino's filmaking abilities to the fullest.When this movie is over it will definitely leave you ready to see Vol. 2. Don't worry, it comes out on DVD on August 6.	5.0	One of the best of 2004	2004-07-29	4	4	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3OEECMCM2T4KQ	C. Middleton	This film is a blood fest delivered as a sly wink with Tarantino's tongue planted firmly in his cheek. He pays tribute to many films in this movie, particularly Honk Kong martial art films of the seventies. Like good rock and roll, the film explodes into action from the beginning and really doesn't let up until the last scene.One can see that he and the cast had a good time making this film, and the fight scenes are hilarious and way over the top. Revenge is the film's theme taken to extremes and Uma Thurman does a fine job seeming to capture exactly what Tarantino had in mind.There were moments in watching the film that I wanted to take it seriously, but as the blood gushed forth endlessly, this was difficult to do. Tarantino appears to have a compulsion about seventies kitsch; somehow intending to make the tasteless and outlandish move beyond hip. The movie is tasteless, ultra-violent, but violent in a comic book context. I suppose this is why the violence lost its impact, because it's meant to be fantasy, dreams of a pubescent boy.There is no depth to this film in terms of narrative because it is really all about imitation and form. This film is not about the story, but a rendering of style, delivery and surfaces that sparkle. It is advertising copy stretched into a feature film. And as all good advertising does, it will grab our attention, dazzle our base emotions, manipulating our sensibilities, turning us into impulsive shoppers.This film is very clever, but that's exactly the point. This is about the wonder boy, Tarantino, reinforcing his image as wonder boy filmmaker, proving again how clever he really is. It is cleverness for its own sake. However, if one goes beyond the tired pastiche, ad copy rendering, and seventies music, Kill Bill is a cheap thrill though good fun while you're watching it, but is easily forgotten as the last credit rolls.	3.0	Cleverness for its own sake.	2004-04-15	4	1	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1GA1FXD7H8LW7	Coby	This movie came out while I was living in Japan, so I happened to see it in a theater over there.  I was very impressed with the story and the overall quality of the movie.  Definitely one of Quentin Tarantino's better works.Then, a year later, I was visiting America and saw the American release.  I couldn't believe how much they butchered it!  They edited it so much to avoid the NC-17 rating that it ruined the overall quality.  The fight scene against the Crazy 88's was spectacular, but they changed it to black and white and cut out the messiest parts.  Other particularly gruesome parts were edited too.  Even the amputation of Sophie's arm was cut. (No pun intended :P )I love the Kill Bill movies, but I will never purchase the hacked-up American release.  The unedited Japanese version, done exactly the way Quentin intended it to be, is all I care to see.	3.0	Japanese Release Was Better	2007-02-05	1	1	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2NLRUTP580DLP	Colby Blair	Gratuitous violence, witty dialogue, fragmented storylines and one heck of a cast - Kill Bill delivers in typical Tarantino fashion.  I think if I had expected less from Tarantino I would have been shocked into Five Stars - but lets be honest, watch Pulp Fiction, slap in Resevoir Dogs and THEN you too will tell me Kill Bill isn't quite what Tarantino is capable of.  I have to admit I loved it - the spraying blood actually put me in mind of Bruce Campbell - The Living Dead - but I was constantly waiting for something fresh - something groundbreaking - soemthing totally Tarantino - and it didn't come.

I am a big Tarantino fan, and I still went into this film not knowing what to expect. I was blown away. I can't even put my finger on why, but I thought it was simply amazing.I will definitely be adding this to my DVD collection.But something tells me maybe we should hold off on this edition. In the past, Tarantino has revisited some his movies with some of the more impressive DVD sets ever. The extra features on Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction helped to improve my appreciation of two already outstanding films.I am guessing that in the wake of releasing Kill Bill vol. 2 in the theaters, Miramax is looking to make some extra cash by selling Vols. 1 and 2 separately. But I would imagine they will also sell a DVD edition combining volume 1 and 2 into one movie, and that's the one I am waiting for.All in all, this is a fantastic movie that belongs in any movie lover's DVD collection, and if you can't wait to buy this one I can certainly understand that. But as for me, I am going to hope that my patience pays off and that we are given the option of buying Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 as one epic film.	5.0	Awesome Movie, But Maybe We Should Wait To Buy	2004-04-06	2	2	0

I still can't stop talking about it, it was too good to be true!! This is the best tribute to old kung fu movies that I've seen. Uma Thurman is at the top of her form as always as well as the rest of the cast.  I kinda wish they would have released this as one film because I generally don't think audiences would have minded the 3 hour + running time after seeing the first hour and a half. Other than that I highly recommend this to any tarantino fan or experimental cinema fans. This is a classic in the making. Oh, and for the reviewer who had ""mixed feelings"" I'm not putting down your opinion or anything because your allowed to have one, but you're wrong about the blood and gore. Pretty much all of the old knug movies I've seen had plenty of that as well as the anime which is why I thought it was perfectly accurate in Kill Bill."	5.0	Utterly Speechless and Amazed!!!	2003-10-13	1	0	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A39AWL2FKWDFK6	Cory D. Slipman	&quot;Kill Bill, Vol. 1&quot; reconfirms that director Quentin Tarantino revels in the depictation of oodles of gory violence.  Trying to follow a similar format to his masterpiece &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, he falls a little short.  Kill Bill, by comparison, lacks the scope and proficiency in weaving together storylines to form the plot.  Having said that, Tarantino is a genius in this blood and guts type of genre.  His film is visually stunning and the choreography of the martial arts scenes is mind boggling.Tarantino fave Uma Thurman is statuesque and athletically gifted as the vengeful martial artist bride who is out to even the score with an assassination squad that murdered all nine in her wedding party.  She appears to have been part of that hit squad.  Nearly killed in the attack, she awakens 4 years later from a coma seeking to kill those responsible for her violation.  Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Viveca Fox and an eye patched Darryl Hannah comprise her targets.Tarantino composes his flick in comic book style with no pretext to clarify or explain things.  I was impressed but felt ripped off with the idea that he was setting me up for a Vol 2, Vol 3, and who knows how many more.  In reality the movie's only real motivation is to line the director's pockets.	4.0	A vehicle for vast parcels of violence	2004-04-27	1	1	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1T3O2LILVK0C4	"Count Orlok '22 "":("""	"WARNING: This review contains spoilers!Note: In my summary of the plot I have put the film's story into chronological order so that events unfold sequentially. This is not the order in which the events of the film are actually shown.Quentin Tarantino (director of Reservoir Dogs and  Pulp Fiction) has often been called one of the most violence-obsessed filmmakers in America, a title that he would occasionally protest. Now we can see why he would have objected to it, he simply hadn't earned that honor yet. But let it be known to all that Quentin Tarantino, or Q.T. as he sometimes refers to himself, is now an official auteur of the action film. His bloody kung fu saga, Kill Bill, is proof of this. Here he pays homage to his favorite exploitation films of the `70s and `80s* with the giddy enthusiasm of a teenaged fanboy.Kill Bill Vol. 1 tells the story of The Bride, a former assassin with the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS), who is brutally attacked and left for dead during her wedding rehearsal by her ex boss/lover Bill. The Bride loses everything and everyone she cares about including her husband-to-be, her friends and her unborn child. After being shot in the head by Bill himself, The Bride sinks into a coma and awakens four whole years later. While she was comatose a hospital nurse sold her body to perverts who would have sex with her. On the day of her resurrection she kills the nurse and the creep who paid to have his way with her, thus beginning a cycle of cold bloody revenge. Her targets: Bill and every one of the Deadly Vipers. Her goal: Kill `em all. Her mission begins with a trip to Japan where she asks the legendary sword maker, Hattori Hanzo, to give her ""Japanese steel"". He refuses saying that he no longer makes instruments of death but when she explains that only his swords are up to the task of killing Bill, who was once Hanzo's student therefore making him partially responsible for Bill's wicked deeds, then he agrees to make her his finest sword, a katana with no equal. He also warns her that before her journey for revenge can begin that she must be sure that she will not falter no matter what. The Bride then leaves with her new weapon and prepares for an epic battle with O-Ren Ishii, a half Japanese, half Chinese, Asian American who's become the leader of a powerful yakuza crime syndicate.When O-Ren was just a young girl she witnessed the horrible murders of her father and mother and she vowed revenge. At the age of twelve she fulfilled her desire for blood when she slew the man responsible. She quickly became one of the youngest and deadliest assassins in the world, which is why Bill took her under his wing.After an amazing showdown with O-Ren and her sword-wielding gang, The Bride hunts down #2 on her list of people to kill, Vernita Green. The Bride and Vernita engage in vicious hand-to-hand combat (with a brief intermission when Vernita's young daughter comes home from school) before Vernita meets her doom before the eyes of her young daughter. But things are never as simple as they seem and ""Revenge is never a straight line."" While The Bride continues on her journey to kill Bill, we learn of a secret that may be her undoing: her daughter, the child that she believed to be dead when she was assaulted on the day of her wedding rehearsal four years earlier, is still alive and living with her daddy, Bill.Some Tarantino fans have complained that this film is a departure from his dialogue-driven serio-comedies about charismatic criminals and lowlifes, but even as this is true Kill Bill is a definitive Tarantino film. Darkly humorous, graphically violent and as irreverent as always, his films polarize, provoke, and entertain audiences, which is why Kill Bill is quintessentially Quentin.The film is rounded out by a terrifically diverse cast including Uma Thurman as The Bride, Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishii, Vivica A. Fox as Vernita Green, Michael Madsen as Budd, Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver, David Carradine as Bill, and Sonny Chiba as Hattori Hanzo.The DVD is a must-have for Tarantino fans, however be warned that a more elaborate DVD release may be on the way. Special features include the Making of Kill Bill featurette, two musical performances by the 5,6,7,8s and trailers for Tarantino's other films.* Here are some of the films and television shows that inspired Q.T. to make Kill Bill:Once Upon a Time in the WestBruce Lee Ultimate CollectionLone Wolf and Cub Box SetFox in a Box - Featuring Pam GrierLady SnowbloodYakuza GraveyardCharlie's Angels - The Complete First SeasonShogun AssassinShadow Warriors - The Complete First Season"	4.0	Kill Bill Vol. 1: The Bride's Revenge	2008-08-15	6	5	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A51IK68MWKV5R	"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies"""	"Whether you enjoy Quentin Tarantino's latest foray into filmmaking, Kill Bill: Volume One, is going to depend a lot on what you bring into it. It is not like his other films, yet, at the same time, it is a lot like them.Kill Bill is the story of ""The Bride,"" aka ""Black Mamba"" (Uma Thurman). After a long tenure with the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS, and an obvious reference to the Fox Force Five from Pulp Fiction), she attempts to leave, settle down, and have a normal life. But the day of her wedding to an unnamed and unseen groom, the entire wedding party is wiped out by the remaining members of the squad. Left for dead, she wakes up four years later in a hospital room, having been in a coma.After a minor rehabilitation period in the back of a truck, she cool-mindedly sets out to destroy the remaining four members of the squad--Vernita Green, aka ""Copperhead"" (Vivica A. Fox); O-Ren Ishii, aka ""Cottonmouth"" (Lucy Liu); Budd, aka ""Sidewinder"" (Michael Madsen); Elle Driver, aka ""California Mountain Snake"" (Daryl Hannah); and their leader, Bill (David Carradine, whose face is never seen--at least not in Volume One.When I say that Kill Bill is not like Tarantino's other films, I mean that while Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Jackie Brown (and From Dusk Till Dawn and True Romance, if you want to be picky about it) were inspired by all the grindhouse, kung fu films, and spaghetti Westerns (a tradition proudly carried forth by his buddy Robert Rodriguez in his ""tortilla Western"" El Mariachi series) that Quentin watched during his days as a video store clerk, Kill Bill is one of those films.  Therefore, prior familiarity with this genre of films is (almost) necessary. I only say almost because my familiarity is minimal but I was still able to enjoy Kill Bill on its own merits, even while knowing that I was no doubt missing out on some subtle (or not-so-subtle) references. Of course, fans know that Quentin is a big fan of films from the 1970s, and from the beginning, there are references that anyone who has read the press surrounding the release of the film will get, like the ""Feature Presentation"" and ""Filmed in Shaw Scope"" cards at the beginning, as well as the Ennio Morricone liberally slathered all over the score.Visually, the movie is a feast. Tarantino uses every trick in the book to make Volume One look beautiful. Moving cameras, sets and backdrops, costumes--all these come together to give the film a certain feel. The humor is a big part of it, too. The massive amounts of blood spilled (450 gallons, according to one source) is done in such a way that it absolutely cannot be taken seriously. I mean, when was the last time you saw a severed limb spurt like it was coming from a garden hose attachment--all circular and pinprick sprays? The anime was done well and buffered some of the more seedy elements of the film. (For some reason, Tarantino feels the need to have some sort of rape in his films nowadays, but the act is never shown explicitly and the perpetrator is always punished. Pedophilia is given a similar treatment in this sequence.)But the most attractive part of this movie is the fact that all the major roles are played by women! (To be chauvinist for a moment, I'd just like to say, ""Baadasssss chicks with swords! How sexy is that?!"") Uma rocks the katana like I've never seen before--all that training really paid off--and this is by far Lucy Liu's best role ever--although that's not really saying much, given the lack of opportunity she has had. But, anyway, watching her in that board meeting was like seeing a new quirk from an old friend--surprising and good. Not all the acting is stellar--Vivica A. Fox is a particular let down, but I think that probably had a lot to do with the lines she was given. So, I guess we'll pin that one on the writer.The story is minimal, but it's all just a hook to hang the revenge motif on. ""The Bride"" gets attempted-murdered and goes out to kill everyone involved. The rest is just the enaction of that plot. There is the usual Tarantino-esque nonlinear storytelling (pay attention to who's been marked off the ""Death List Five"") and probably will require multiple viewings to catch all the references, but, all in all Kill Bill: Volume One is a rollercoaster ride of a movie with a lot to offer fans and newcomers with either previous knowledge or open minds."	4.0	The Return of Tarantino	2003-10-15	2	1	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	To say this is a Quentin Tarantino action movie pretty much tells the whole story (if you know Quentin Terantino's other films). However, as I'm a much more long-winded guy than that, I'll supply some details. It has been amply publicized that Kill Bill is an homage (or blatent copy) of Kung Fu/Samurai films (mainly the latter because everyone has a sword), but updated in the same way that Raiders of the Lost Ark updated B-movie serials of the '40's (this is Tarantino's analogy). The story: An assasin tries to retire and goes into hiding, but is found and murdered on her wedding day, along with her entire wedding party and unborn child. But wait! Despite being shot in the head and spending 4-years in a coma, a scant few months after awakening she is the greatest sword-fighter in the world. If this sounds rediculous, it's because logic and plot should not really be contemplated when discussing this film.Uma Thurman plays the not-quite-killed Bride who seeks revenge on her former colleagues, who include Lucy Liu, Vivica Fox, and Daryl Hannah. These 4 women in a film together makes it worth viewing, and they all reach a kind of sublime corniness - the entire film is a wink at the audience, but the actors never let themselves in on the joke. The action and the swordplay are a delight to watch. It is extremely violent, but in a corny, stylised way (much like the Evil Dead films) - limbs are severed and fountains of blood spray out. That no one bleeds to death after losing this much blood is part of the joke.There are great highlights to the film. I especially liked The Bride's excape from the hospital after awakening from her coma, and the opening battle of the film with the Fox character. Unfortunately, the culminating battle - with Liu's private army of 88 sword-weilding grunts plus her personal assistants - goes on far too long and frankly gets boring. The most disappointing aspect of the film, however, is the startling lack of dialogue. I go to see Tarantino films for the intercharacter banter - see Pulp Fiction, for example. Here, the plot is so action-driven the characters have little chance to speak, and when they do, it's banal speeches like the one Liu delivers after decapitating a lieutenant for having the gall to disparage her Chinese heritage.These disappointments are somewhat petty - the film is not supposed to be about dialogue, after all. However, this DVD edition is a big disappointment. It looks and sounds great, but that is expected of a 2003 release. No, it's the lack of extras that robs a star from my rating of the film - Tarantino is such an interesting guy, very self-aware and knowledgeable, so why isn't there a director's commentary? No, all we get on this DVD is a short making-of featurette that looks like it was assembled from bits that appeared on Entertainment Tonight. I refuse to purchase Mirimax DVD's because they are so bare-bones it's not worth the money. I will wait and hope for a &quot;special edition&quot; box set packaging Vol. 1 and 2 together.	3.0	4-star film on a 1-star DVD	2004-07-30	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A5DIAZ5GT3MC	Crazy Jim	"It has been far too long since Quentin Tarantino dropped a new film and the wait seemed to be even more of a kick in the back end when Quentin announced that he would be cutting his martial arts revenge flick in to two halves. As an avid fan, I was lukewarm to the idea of him taking six years and coming with what seemed to be a silly martial arts homage pic. Truth be told ""Kill Bill"" is a silly martial arts homage pic but its presentation is what makes it work.Uma Thurman is The Bride, a deadly assassin, ambushed on her wedding night by her former associates. Four years later, she awakens from her coma and seeks out revenge. Her hit squad- Vivica A. Fox, Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah, and Lucy Liu, are all here and they are working for the unseen but well heard Bill (played by David Carradine). Going back and forth from different locations such as Tokyo and Pasadena, The Bride takes all comers in bloody fight after bloody fight.""Kill Bill"" is almost instantly the most violent film in recent movie history. Though most of its violence seems similar to that of the comedic swordfight in ""The Addams Family"" with blood spraying like a sprinkler, it is still amazing that this violent tour-de-force avoided the NC-17 rating. ""Bill"" features some of Tarantino's finest visual work though his usual witty dialouge does fall victim in some areas. Anyone who shares his love for the classic martial arts flicks of the 70's will absolutely love this movie. With images shot in all different formats including one in the classic Japanese ""anime"" style introducing Lucy Liu's O-Ren Ishi, Quentin is never afraid to try something a little different.If nothing else, ""Kill Bill"" is an extremely fun movie. Tarantino is certainly having a good time, especially with his casting of such cult heroes as Sonny Chiba and Michael Parks. Of course, the movie brings ""suspension of disbelief"" to new levels. No, Uma Thurman would not be able to bring the world's most deadly sword on a plane with her. Of course, she would not be able to sit around in the hospital parking lot in a murdered ordely's car for three hours. But does anyone go to a samurai movie for realism? ""Kill Bill"" shows that Tarantino knows how to make a film that will not only please longtime genre fans but bring in a crossover fanbase who might not have ever watched any of these films. Just as he did with horror films in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and blaxplotation flicks with ""Jackie Brown"", you are getting a film that is esentially an explotation film with a big budget and an excellent cast."	4.0	KILL BILL Review	2003-10-13	0	0	0

A bride gets shot and left for dead by her no good husband (who also happens to be her employer as the head of an organized hit squad).  There is no suspense, either.  The bride is gonna kill the rest of the hit squad to get to him and she will either get her revenge or die trying.And while not having much of a plot or any suspense might leave most movies dead in the tracks, Kill Bill succeeds and succeeds with aplomb mostly because of Tarantino's love for the genre and talent for dialogue and Uma Thurman's tour de force acting and physicality.A lot of people are going to sit there and complain that the movie isn't about very much and that it's neither brainy nor socially redeming in the way...oh, I don't know, ""Schindler's List"" is but they'd be missing the point.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ATWK744FUQXVX	Crowsdreamofdeth	Kill Bill may not have exceeded or surpassed in excellence the masterfully executed Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, or even Jackie Brown, but it certainly was an enjoyment to watch, as well as stocked full of artistic innovation. With far more depth than its plot suggests, this movie runs like a hybrid between Austin Powers and Natural Born Killers, replete with action, animation, surrealism, scenes shot in black and white, and plenty of gore, blood, beheadings, and other stomach churning visions of violence. Heavily influenced by speghetti Westerns, 1960s martial art flicks, and 70s imagery, Kill Bill is a refreshing cinematic experience as compared to the slew of mundane &quot;feel good&quot; films that make up the majority of Hollywood movies. The only thing I felt that Kill Bill lacked was the usual highly humorous dialogue that has been the trademark of Tarantino movies. Also, the drawn out bloodletting at the end of the movie in which Uma Thurman takes on a countless number of sword welding samurais and wins, was a 20 or so minute scene that was difficult to suspend my disbelief for, however, when one realizes that Kill Bill was in many ways attempting to emulate cheesy 60s martial art films, its easier to appreciate the artistic value, and the fight scenes were surely more entertaining than the unresolved, ultra-macho, juvenile excrement of the Matrix films.	4.0	Great, but not Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs.	2004-05-09	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A34ZVLFQSI8O2I	"C. Weldon ""Movie Guy"""	Quentin Tarentino has always been a genius.  He can take any genre of film and turn it into gold.  Kill Bill Vol. 1 gives new life to the old Kurosawa samurai films and breathes new life into them.  Add in some anime and kung fu fighting and you have a hack em and slash em revenge flick for the ages.  Uma Thurman plays the Bride, the most bad ass character ever to grace the silver screen.  Once a member of the Viper Assassination Squad, now seeking revenge on them for trying to kill her.  We get to see every step of her revenge plot unfold.  Uma makes revenge seem like childs play as she works her way thru her old co-workers.  One of the brightest shining stars in this movie is Chiaki Kuriyama who plays GoGo Yubari.  If ever there was a chick that deserves a video game, it's her.  She is O-ren Ishii's (Lucy Lui) bodyguard.  She is the best thing since fried rice.  She's cute, she's cheeky, and she can kick some major butt.  This is Quentin's best work yet, and a must see film.	5.0	Kill Bill Again and Again	2004-05-08	0	0	0

In the infinite wisdom of not offending the MPAA, Tarantino practised self-censorship and degraded his grindhouse of a fine movie to such an abysmal state.The showdown sequence was practically unwatchable.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	`Kill Bill' has received a lot of praise and love from fans and critics alike, but up until this week I had yet to watch it.  Now, after watching both volumes I can attest to the fact that these films really are that good.  It's refreshing to see something we've never seen before be done so well, so expertly crafted so it feels like the film you've been waiting for.  It's a perfect example of a revenge story gone terribly...right.  Tarantino wrote and of course directed a masterpiece here, mixing all the great aspects of kung-fu films and westerns as well as anima and comic books giving us a brilliant script coupled with acting worthy of Oscarbait wrapped in a beautiful package and delivered to you DVD player.This tale tells the story of The Bride (Thurman), a former assassin who was brutally attacked during her wedding rehearsal by her former colleges.  The attack resulted in the murder of her closest friends and her husband to be, as well as her unborn child.  What it failed to do was take the life of the main target, and upon awakening from her four year coma she's out for revenge.Thurman does a brilliant job taking what could have been pure camp and creating a memorable character in the history of movie cinema.  As The Bride tracks down her former friends and picks them off one by one we see her grow stronger with anger and determination as she works towards her goal to `Kill Bill'.  Sporting great supporting roles by Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Liu as two former assassin's that meet their end at the hands of a woman scorned.  The film itself is filmed brilliantly with over the top action (the violence being so unrealistic it's almost funny...and that my friends is half the fun) that makes for an exciting ride that all will enjoy.Quentin has cemented himself as one of the most genius directors we have today, not afraid to make a statement, to bend the rules and test our tolerance.  He is a moviemaker above all others who always serves up the best plate on the table.	5.0	Revenge is oh so sweet!	2006-08-21	7	6	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AILBDL6ATVDCJ	"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL"""	I can only guess that most of these reviews are based upon the fact that Quentin Tarantino is such a &quot;down to earth&quot; guy that some of the reviewers are hoping he offers them a part in his next film.  Tarantino is the SHOCK-JOCK of movie making; in all of Tarantino's movies, his main goal is to shock the viewer with violence...got that.  Yes, we got that.  Boy, do we have that by now.Kill Bill is a music video - death dance.  111 minutes of me starting to wish one of those Samuri swords Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu were flipping around might cut the tape to this dreadful VHS tape I actually rented today.This movie may have action, but it has no drawing force to pull you into what is happening.  Every fight scene last a little too long; every cut off limb spews out blood just a little too long; and I wasn't impressed with a twelve-year-old cartoon girl seducing an Asian mob-boss so she could drive a blade through his chest.If you think Howard Stern is cool, you might like this movie.  If you think profanity and rampant violence make a movie great, then by all means, rush out and buy this DVD (or buy it here at Amazon.com).  But if you enjoy a movie with some substance and good dialogue, hold off on this one.I have watched a few interviews with Tarantino, and I must say I was quite impressed with his demeanor - he seems really cool.  I'm sure this review will be disliked by his fans, but I think he could have made a better film than what I just watched.	2.0	111 Minutes Of Typical Quentin Tarantino Nonsense	2004-04-25	17	14	3

Tarantino's genius is the ability to get into the heads of people raised on pop culture, harvest all these crazy images from film, TV and music and tie them together into a story line that makes sense and is satisfying on a deep level. He's definitely evolved with this film, which has a moral center in the Bride whether fanboys want to admit it or not. The fights are spectacular and funny at the same time and Uma Thurman actually acts with more than her cheekbones for a change. Topping it off is a fantastic soundtrack which I went out and bought the same night. Only weak point, in my view, was Daryl Hannah, whose acting is sub-replicant level.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1R8AO9XASQ15C	Daniel A. Marsh	What we have in &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is Quentin Tarantino's glorious evolution beyond his mid-90s &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; phase, into the realm of truly inspired and, needless to say, brilliant filmmaking. Here is a director who is truly the equal of Spielberg, Welles, Kubrick and Leone. Hell, after watching &quot;Kill Bill Vol. 1,&quot; I'm tempted to say he exceeds all those guys. He is certainly operating on a new level of greatness.How else to describe it? &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is the ultimate action film. It's like the best of Kurosawa, Leone and Robert Rodriguez, all rolled into one beautifully shot, beautifully choreographed, beautifully written, beautiful movie. The violence is beside the point. This is cinematic poetry. (The cartoonish violence is so hysterically over-the-top that it is impossible to take seriously and, therefore, about as &quot;disturbing&quot; as the typical episode of Spongebob Squarepants. That said, do not attempt to watch this film if you do not possess a strong stomach or a strong appreciation for black humor.)The acting is superb. This is Uma Thurman unleashed. Sonny Chiba is brilliant in his own way. Lucy Liu has never been better. Daryl Hannah provokes chills. Can't wait to see more of Carradine and Madsen in Vol. 2. I even loved Michael Parks as the sheriff.But the real star is Quentin Tarantino. No longer a &quot;boy wonder,&quot; no longer the Flavor of the Week for the Gen X crowd, Tarantino is now a filmmaker for the ages, and his &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is not only a classic of the genre, but a thrilling example of cinema at its passionate best.	5.0	Tarantino's best	2004-04-14	1	1	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1HNO8XJS4EDHA	Daniel Geffre	Like most of Tarantino's work, he doesn't hold back. He puts people in situations that some of us that are watching it wish we'll never end up in. That's the great thing about him. He basically speaks his mind and does what other people don't have enough guts to do because they're afraid of what others may think of them as a person.Kill Bill basically takes every dark comedic moment Tarantino has to offer and injects them with steroids. From the moment the movie starts, to the cartoon segments, to the vast fight scene showing Uma Thurman as a Warrior Princess that should not have been messed with. There was not one dull moment in the movie, and for the viewers that found one, Tarantino made up for it in the following scene.How many Kung Fu movies have there been? A vast majority of fighting movies are Kung Fu. Tarantino is a classic director. He took what he likes from others films. He took the best part of it and molded it into his own. I hear every now and then people say he's a rip off and he copies everyone. If that's the case then every single director except the very first one to have ever existed is a copy cat. That's what makes a director, taking what you like, putting yourself into it and making it your own.Just when you think he'll let you put your head above water and come up for some air, he pulls you back down and shoves some more of it in your face. And the best part is. Some scenes in here people are afraid to admit they like because of what others might think. But if Tarantino did the same thing, there would be no Kill Bill.	5.0	Tarantino doesn't hold back.	2004-02-27	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A13RM1AWD1C5ZR	Daniel K.	Kill Bill, Volume 1, Quentin Tarantino's first film in six years is nothing short of spectacular.  It's outrageous, ingenious, funny and wildly inventive as well as exceptionally bloody.The film's premise is simple enough though, Uma Thurman plays the Bride who is out for revenge after her wedding becomes a bloodbath.  Her boss and ex-lover Bill (David Carridine, whose face we never see in the film) kills her.  After she wakes up from a four year coma, she's out for vengeance after all the gangsters who tried to kill her including Vivica A. Fox, Michael Madsen, Lucy Liu, David Carridine and others.  The fightings scenes are top-notch with well choreographed swordplay.  Some might view this film as a bunch of pointless action sequences scrunched into one movie, but under Tarantino's masterful direction, it's great.  He is the king of pop cinema and has remained to be.  The film has been divided into two parts, so Volume 2 won't hit theatres until February 2004.Kill Bill is rated R for Strong Bloody Violence, Language and Some Sexual Content.  Kill Bill is not one for adolescent audiences, since it features extensive bloody violence including limbs, heads, etc. getting chopped off.  There is also an equally bloody animated sequence.  There is some vile sexual innuendo including discussion of raping a comatose women as well as other sexual references.  There is also strong profanity.  All in all, mainly one for 17 year olds and up.  Luckily I saw this one in theatres and I recommened it to be viewed in theatres cause it's a great film and another Tarantino classic.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3GRANSGMYPX00	"Danielle Kuehnel ""A Trendy Twentysomething"""	I was a bit skeptical about this film, simply because Uma Thurman was going to do a bit of martial arts in it. No longer will I be saying that - she does an excellent job with the fight scenes (and there are a lot of those) and I definitely can't wait until installment two comes out.This movie leaves so much undisclosed: her name is always bleeped out, the news about her child, and who the heck Bill is. Tarantino did a great job of cliff-hanging, and leaving room for more information in movies to come.The cinematography was also rather creative, in my opinion. I like how it went from black and white, to color, to animation; from English to Japanese. The language changes seem so fluid that it took me a minute to notice that another language was being spoken.Kudos to 'Kill Bill.'

Only, instead of making it exploitive, he makes it empowering. Uma Thurman is an ex-employee for a team of expert assasins, and she's hell bent on revenge for the murder of her fiance and her attempted murder. She is anything but a damsel in distress. She's a hand-to-hand combater, a samurai warrior, a master escape artist and a crafty detective. (...)If this movie isn't modern day feminism, I don't know what is.Like any Tarantino film, this movie has brilliant, inventive cinematography, great dialogue, amazing action scenes and choregography, fantastic music and just bursting with wit and well...it's just hip.Not for the queemish and weak-stomached.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3KOVFORKXQ2U9	Daniel McInnis	Okay, so it's probably a little unfair to evaluate a movie when you've only seen the first half of it, but I can assure you that it's no less fair than having to pay full ticket price (about $10 here in Toledo) to see the same half of a movie.  Of course, there are those rare exceptions, movies so good that theater owners could practically send ushers up the aisles every half hour to make collections, and I'd happily pay (think &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;).  Unfortunately, &quot;Kill Bill Volume 1&quot; is not one of them.  So, fair or not, here it goes...As I look at the cover of this DVD, I'm reminded of a famous pitch Robert Evans gave at the Cannes Film Festival about twenty years back.  While trying to sell investors on &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; he said, &quot;If you don't like the poster, then don't buy the movie.&quot;  Well, you could say the same for &quot;Kill Bill,&quot; if you don't like the cover, featuring Uma Thurman in Bruce Lee's yellow track suit and sporting a confused look on her face, then this probably isn't for you.  The reason is simple, that &quot;is&quot; the movie.Okay, so maybe there's a little bit more to it than that, but not much.  The simple fact of the matter is this, &quot;Vol. 1&quot; is as much a study in excess as it is a homage to the grind house films that inspired it.  Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  After all, there's no other director working today any better at it than Quentin Tarantino.  The problem is, the strengths he exhibited in &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; &quot;Jackie Brown,&quot; and &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; are notably absent here.When I think Q.T., I think smart, fast-paced dialogue and great casting.  He's done it time and again, but here, his biggest assets have become the film's greatest flaws.  The most notable of which is the character's interaction, limited to predictable one-liners and delivered with tongue planted firmly in cheek, which in turn has a trickle down effect on the actors.  Some, such as David Carradine, are perfectly suited for this, but others are not.Which lead to the movie's greatest fault, the casting of Uma Thurman.  Don't get me wrong, I think she's one of the best actors working in Hollywood today, but she simply has a grace, a presence, a regalness, which doesn't fit this kind of genre filmmaking.  Another thing she has going against her is, well...  I don't know of a politically correct way of saying this, but she's white.  And I, personally, think that white people look totally ridiculous doing the kind of acrobatics she's called upon to do here.  I mean, seriously, can anyone sit though one of those &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; movies without falling out their seats in absolute hysterics at every fight sequence?You kind of get the sense that this is a point not lost on it's star either, as much of the film she looks extremely self-conscious.  Now, as a wannabe filmmaker, one of the greatest lessons I've learned shooting various short films (none of them very good) is that you can never allow your actors to feel uncomfortable or awkward at any time, but this is something that Tarantino's never had to confront.  See, prior to this he's always been working with the very best of scripts, but here is trying to make a movie that's essentially a homage to films that are predominantly not very good.Others, such as Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, have navigated this obstacle much better.  When they set out to make the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; series, for example, they took all the best parts of the classic serials of their youths and junked the rest.  Tarantino, though, isn't as discriminating and, as a result, is far too conservative when it comes to making cuts.  That being said, though, still I have to admit that as soon as this movie ended, I couldn't wait to go back and watch it again.  Go figure.	3.0	Full Review, Half A Movie	2004-05-28	8	3	5

The production seems almost effortless at times, skillfully crafted and tightly edited.The first installment is the perfect &quot;way-in&quot; to the series, featuring a decidedly PoMo amalgam of genres, techniques and media.  The anime sequence is among the best I've seen.Uma, as the Bride, represents one of the greatest femme fatales in recent film history.In the end this is truly an homage to various film genres that play very prominently in Taratino's psyche.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ATS7LYGLUX34L	Daniel V. Reilly	If that phrase means ANYTHING to you, you'll absolutely LOVE Kill Bill, Volume 1. The fourth film by pop-culture sponge/Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino is a bloody stew of Kung-Fu, Anime, Samurai, Blaxploitation, 80's Brian De Palma, Spaghetti Westerns, Ennio Morricone, and just about every other bizarre influence you could possibly imagine, all mixed together and served up piping hot. Or should that be totally cool...?Uma Thurman stars as the Woman with no name; Honestly- Her name is bleeped on the few occasions anyone in the film utters it. Let's just call her The Bride. The Bride is a former member of The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS, an elite squad of female assassine, headed up by the titular enigma, Bill.) who apparently don't take kindly to her retirement. The girls bust up The Bride's Wedding, killing everybody, before Bill himself delivers the coup de grace to the pregnant Bride- A bullet to the head. Since it wouldn't be much of a revenge film otherwise, The Bride isn't quite dead; She languishes in a coma for four years before coming to, and when she wakes up, she's got bloody deeds on her mind- A literal Death List, comprised of Bill and his DiVAS.Kill Bill, Volume 1 chronicles the start of The Bride's vengeance, as she faces off against Viper-turned-housewife Vernita Green (Viveca A. Fox) and Yakuza head-honcho O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), leaving Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen), and Bill (David Carradine, whose face is never actually shown) for Volume 2, due February 20th 2004. The film is almost literally awash in blood- People in the audience I saw the film with were covering their faces, like the blood might get on them or something. It's been a long time since I've seen such a violent film, and I certainly can't recall any mainstream films that contained such carnage. (Still, it seems the MPAA made their mark on the film- There's a long black-and-white sequence during the House of Blue Leaves segment, which sees The Bride face off against an army of Yakuza thugs in a huge sword fight; I suspect it was made black-and-white to avoid the dreaded NC-17 rating. It was a little annoying, and I hope that scene is presented in color for the DVD release.) Fans expecting Tarantino's usual snappy dialogue will probably be a little disappointed- Kill Bill is almost a silent movie; There is literally almost nothing but fighting and killing for two hours. I'm not much of a fan of Viveca A. Fox and Lucy Liu, but they did a good job in their respective fight scenes, and Thurman is a revelation as The Bride- Sexy, funny, and deadly all at once. I especially enjoyed Chiaki Kuriyama as O-Ren Ishii's bodyguard, the giggly, schoolgirl-uniformed, Go-Go Yubari. Her fight with The Bride is a definite highlight of Volume 1. Fans of seventies grind-house cinema will get a big kick out of seeing Sonny Chiba's appearance as sword-maker Hattori Hanzo, who fashions The Bride's weapon of choice.It's a good thing Tarantino decided to split Kill Bill into two seperate films- After two hours, I was drained and burnt-out. I don't think I'd have been able to take any more in one sitting. But the shocking final line of dialogue, spoken by Bill himself, has me counting the days until Volume 2.	4.0	Presented In Shaw-Scope!!	2003-10-13	1	0	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3A6OP5L54QD8B	Dante Golio	"Jilted lovers can be bitter, for sure.  Even globe-trotting assassins have a heart!  Quentin Tarantino brings us ""Bill"" and ""The Bride.""  Witness as she survives her ex-boyfriend's wedding-day attack to battle 88 foes (at the same time), premature burial, poisonous snakes and more.  She now exists with one motive in mind:  She must Kill Bill!!  Tarantino's seminal brand of ""Over the Top-ness"" works perfectly within the Kung Fu genre, as it should. The Writer/Director majorly pleases his cult fan base with 4 hours of slicing and dicing . . . And that's just with the dialogue.Uma Thurman radiates beauty despite slaughtering over 100 folks during both movies.  The late David Carradine (perfectly cast) plays it cool as the titular villain.  While he gets no face time in Volume 1, Volume 2 presents a Bill ""Tour De Force.""  The supporting cast is all memorable too.  From Lucy Liu's totally bad-ass Oren Ishii to Michael Madsen's turn as Bill's bumpkin brother Budd to the great Sonny Chiba (Hattori Hanso!).  Two actors even assume double-roles:  Gordon Liu and Michael Parks.Some critics chastised Tarantino for making KILL BILL a double-movie.  The films needed editing, they concluded.  Shame on those writers!  Every minute of this opus is ESSENTIAL.  To all those appreciative of exquisitely violent Action/Drama jam packed with gushing blood, eye-gouging, severed limbs, eviscerations and de-capitations:  Prepare to kneel in praise of the Master."	5.0	"""I overreacted"""	2011-05-02	1	1	0

(This review is prompted by the ad to purchase that popped up as a &quot;recommendation&quot; from Amazon.)I gave a &quot;don't see&quot; review to IMDB on the film KILL BILL -- I guess I should have done the same on Amazon, too. (now posted)I almost walked out of the theater 7 times--but kept thinking it would have SOME socially redeeming value--eventually--it didn't. I hated the movie for its constant violence. I don't recommend it to anyone to see, in fact I use the film as an example of what NOT TO SEE! Can this director ever do a non-violent film?  He is so talented and if he broadend his vision outside of violence think what he could do!As mentioned, my comments here are due to opening my Amazon page and seeing a recommendation to purchase the movie. I was offended that Amazon thought it would match my past purchase choices.I saw the film and found it too violent, too offensive, and the fact that Amazon is now putting the ads in everyones face--I also find offensive. The movie glorified killing and violence... there was no socially redeeminng value to the story! Has the ad dept at Amazon seen it? Where did their computer get the idea that I ever ordered such violent films or have ever ordered even a violent book? Why did Amazon think I would like this so much that they listed it as a recommendation? Obviously, it must have been a general ad to everyone--which compounds the issue...not everyone will write Amazona about this. Multiply my letter by 100 or 1,000 that felt the same but didn't bother to write mazon. ( I also sent a separate email letter to Amazon's recommendations dept.)This is not family fare, not even content everyone should see--talented director aside.Viewing such violence releases negative toxins into the body that remain there for 4 days! Four days of releasing negative toxins toward the world. Four days of teens with an &quot;attitude&quot; parents hate. Look at the amount of toxic overload (negative body chemicals) teens get from such films or playing/viewing violent games, or even the news. Enough is enough already! I've asked Amazon's ad dept to remove me from their list for such violent ads. People should be asked if they want these ads in their face when they open up their Amazona page, or the day may come when lawyers sue media and advertisers over the indescriminate toxins forced upon the public. I can't turn off my opening Amazon page, it is not a TV/Cable channel. Just seeing the ad brought up all the negative crap and toxins I experienced watching the film. Amazon and this review are now on the receiving end of my negative toxic overload...day one down three to go. Enough! Go read a good book, like ISN'T IT ROMANTIC? by Ronda Thompson. It's a romantic comedy that will make you laugh--release positive endorphins and make you upbeat for days!	1.0	violent, violent, violent -- bad toxins for your body	2004-05-05	39	5	34

It is ultra violent so if your not into that see something else.  This movie is about revenge.  Uma Thurman is a Assassin who desides to desert the group.  She is them ambushed by the other members of the group at her wedding and is put into a coma for four years.  When she wakes up she wants payback.The fight scenes are incredible and bloody as hell.  In fact it is so bloody that you almost want to laugh.  The acting is great.  The music is perfect and the story is very original.By the way it is a two part movie so when you get to the end don't be suprised when it stops in a weird spot.If you like the movie, this director has made other great films like Pulp Fiction, Resevoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and has written Natural Born Killers and True Romance.

You really feel ""The Bride""'s (Uma) from the moment the movie begins and you really want her to kick some arse after seeing what happend to her, and Quintin doesn't let you down there. O-Ren is great, the cartoon showing her background was unexpected yet suitable for the movie and I really ejoyed it. Gogo is great, a take no crap psycho cutie that can really dish it out. I love her.This movie really is very beautiful once you get past all the blood and gore which is almost cartoonish.f the most beautiful movies I have ever scene. It is also hilarious at times too. The scene with Hatori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba) had me in stitches it was so funny.The fight scenes are some of the best stuff I've scene since Iron Monkey. Showdown at House of Blue Leaves is my favourite movie scene of all time. Bodies everywhere! Amazingly excuted by all involved. Just awesome. The final fight scene with O-Ren is so beautiful. Pure white snow falling on a moon-lit japanese garden with sounds of trickling water and the clashing of swords. O-Ren's pure white dress and Uma's blood-stained copy of the outfit Bruce Lee wore in his final fight scene are great too.I love the music in all parts of the movie. The speghetti western, samurai and other borrowed music was well selected and the original tracks are also awesome. I especially love the ""5,6,7s and 8s"", there's just something about Japanese girls singing surf music...BEST MOVIE EVER!!!"	5.0	MASTERPIECEMAN	2004-04-30	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AIMGHPI1AGVRF	Davewise	"The storyline is rather simple - ""the Bride"" is out for revenge against Bill, a former boss and father of her unborn child, and his followers who turned her wedding into a bloodbath, almost killing her. However, Tarantino's style and writing along with a superb performance by Uma Thurman elevate this movie to greatness. There is never a dull moment and the viewer cheers for the Bride, despite the fact she's also an assassin who's out to kill people. Part of that is due to her reason for revenge, and part is due to Tarantino's style which actually makes the movie ""fun"" in a way.By now I think most people are prepared for the amount of violence in Tarantino's films. In this movie he takes advantage of the freedom in an anime-type sequence to have even more blood. The violence in ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" is over-the-top to the point where it's humorous at times.The performances by all the actors are very good, especially Thurman. While there is plenty of action, there are also a good number of dramatic scenes and it does include some humor. I particularly enjoyed a series of scenes where the Bride was visiting Japan to obtain a special samurai sword which demonstrated a sense of honor. And there was a scene with Lucy Lui's character - also an assassin - in a board room meeting which was hilarious! Overall, I think it's a great action movie and is one of Tarantino's best."	5.0	Simple but brilliant action movie	2009-09-19	4	3	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY	"David A. Dein ""passafist"""	"Have you ever read a book where you sort of got into it, but you're not quite sure if you like it. The story is good enough to keep you interested and yet you know in your heart you've read better. You get to the point where the story begins to pick up a little and then you put it down never to pick it back up again? I've done that so many times I can't fathom how many half-read books I have on my bookshelf. Quentin Tarantino's (Pulp Fiction) new film KILL BILL: VOLUME 1 is very much like that. It's watch able, it somewhat compelling, and at the moment it begins to pick up, the credits roll.KILL BILL stars UMA THURMAN (Pulp Fiction) as The Bride (I prefer to call her *Bleep*, cause early in the film they bleep her name out three times and I thought it was kind of funny), a women on a quest for revenge. It seems *Bleep* was getting married when a group of really bad dudes crashed the party, killing everyone, including her unborn baby. That is except for *Bleep* who somehow and against all odd survives and now she's out for blood.She begins picking off everybody who was involved in the plot to murder her. In Volume One she meets up with Vernita (Vivica A Fox, Juwanna Mann), now a housewife with a husband and a child and O-Ren Ishi, a sexy underworld leader in Tokyo. She also makes friends with an old Mr. Myiagi type (Sonny Chiba, Immortal Combat) who designs kick *** swords and quotes old eastern proverbs like they've gone out of fashion.To be honest there isn't much to talk about concerning this film. Except to say that its pretty violent in a silly stylized way, the action scenes are well worth the price of admission, and that unlike most movies this one is missing a core story. We never find out who The Bride is, we don't know why Bill (played incognito by David Carradine, G.O.D.) wants to kill *Bleep*, and we don't know why *Bleep* doesn't have a name. It's just one action scene after another and we're not quite sure whom to root for.Of the movies that could have been split up into two parts this film is not a prime candidate (1995 Gettysburg would have probably faired better in two parts). The way it's edited now it feels like a pilot for a television series and not a film. I'm not even quite sure if I liked it or not. There's not enough here to make a distinction. I guess it looks really good, the action sequences are top-notch, and there's an anime sequence that would make a great short by itself. Other than that it's an action film that is really not about anything.As for the performances, the only one that sticks out is Lucy Liu (Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever) who has an amazing screen presence to begin with. In fact if there is a character in this movie that's worth rooting for, it's her. But I think that's because she's the only character that the film digs deep into. The aforementioned anime sequence is her back-story.Come to think of it KILL BILL: VOLUME 1 is like the first two stages of a ""Double Dragon"" type video game. Each scene has little guys you need to kill and then a boss. I guess Bill will be the final boss, let's just hope that he's a hard kill. Cause I want Volume 2, to lift Volume 1 out of the gutter.So at this point I reserve judgement either way until KILL BILL: VOLUME 2 is released in February. Cause right now it's on that thin line between a great movie and a mediocre one. On it's own it's only worth the price of admission to action freaks and kung fu enthusiasts. All others would probably do themselves better by waiting to see both movies together,Please Quentin don't let us down.*** out of 5 (This could change pending VOLUME 2)"	3.0	Don't Let Us Down Quentin!!!!	2003-10-14	4	3	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	David Anderson	"""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" is Oscar winner Quinton Tarantino's first film release since his long break.  After directing and producing films ""Pulp Fiction"", ""From Dusk Til Dawn"", ""Jackie Brown"", and others, he yet again masters another unforgettable film.  The man known for creating 1970's style films masters another potential classic.  This time, it's almost his most bloody and graphic film to date.  He proves that he is a highly unique film maker with his untouchable style.  This film begins the quest of The Bride's (Uma Thurman) revenge after having lain in a coma for years.  She now wants to kill her assaillants, especially Bill.This film contains the perfect level of action, martial arts, and wit throughout the mission.  This creative plot takes audiences closely into the mind of those experiencing these events.  The film never holds back on the hardcore graphic violence, the blood, the body parts, and others.  Tarantino stays true with his trademark with occassional long flashbacks and one-of-a-kind camera work.  The numerous change of color backgrounds, including black and white, give each individual scene the added intensity that it deserves.Through the numerous physical brutalies lies the emotional value expressed throughout.  None is more expressed than Uma Thurman's powerful performance.  Her anger, sadness, and rage never loses its intensity throughout the film.  This is in no doubt her best work in her career, possibly tying her Oscar nominated role in ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994).  Other performers also give wonderful performances, offering their own taste of theme: Vivica A. Fox, Pam Grier, Lucy Liu, Daryl Hannah, and others.""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" is a great action film for those looking for something intense.  This is sure to keep audiences awaiting anxiously for the sequel ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"".  Those curious about this series must watch Vol. 1 first.  Otherwise Vol. 2 will be highly confusing.  Unfortunately, according to Tarantino, fans must wait about 15-20 years for Vol. 3 to be released."	5.0	Bloody Awesome	2004-10-18	2	2	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"After a seven year wait between Tarantino films, I awaited ""Volume 1"" anxiously.  Now Tarantino's previous film, ""Jackie Brown"" was a work of progress for him.  It was more story oriented and had extremely good acting and character developement.  Some people would say that ""Kill Bill"" is a step back from the maturity Tarantino displayed with ""Jackie Brown"".  That said, one has to accept this film for what it is and see if it succeeds on it's own terms.  It does.  It's difficult to separate this film from ""Volume 2"" because if you asked me prior to seeing the second film how I would rate ""Volume 1"" I would have given it four stars.  I would have said that it was entertaining and well acted but it lacked charater developement and the story left you hanging.  However, now having seen ""Volume 2"", I would say it made perfect sense to cram the action in the first part and save character and plot for the second one.  As for the acting, Tarantino has cast this film perfectly.  Uma Thurman emerges as a compelling action star here but is a good enough actress to imbue sympathy for her character ""Black Mamba"".  Lucy Liu is her equal as the Chinese-Japanese-American warlord who used to be Thurman's ally with the DIVA hit squad.  I saw this film originally in a theatre and even though the violence is over-the-top I didn't find it that disturbing.  On home video, however, I found the violence much more jarring even though it is employed to a somewhat cartoonish effect.  Elements that also work here are the snappy editing and cinematography and of course Tarantino's unusually impecable choice of music and song that are scene appropriate."	5.0	Tarantino's Ongoing Evolution as a Great Director	2004-08-13	4	3	1

Selection of UMD movies is very scarce, hard to find and are sometimes expensive due to limited availability.

Not much special features. Just a couple. One is the making of ""Kill Bill"" (22 minutes) which is your standard cast, crew interviews mixed with some film and behind-the scenes footage. The other feature is a six minute music video by 5, 6, 7 & 8 (four Asian females dressed in beige dresses) singing the song ""Woo-Hoo"".

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	Writer-director Quentin Tarantino indulges his love for revenge flicks and martial arts movies in the story of a former member of an assassination squad (Uma Thurman) who seeks revenge against her former teammates (Viveca Fox and Lucy Liu) after they wipe out the members of her wedding party.  The result is highly watchable, but somehow sterile and unsatisfying.Tarentino's films have always been more about style and homage than substance, but with &quot;Kill Bill&quot; he threatens to tip over into self-parody.  Has he been reading too many worshipful articles about himself?  His films have always been exercises in hip and cool, but this one seems especially self-consciously so.  The characterization of previous films is gone, replaced by iconic cartoon cutouts that are motivated by the demands of stereotype.  His dialogue is always cited as a strength, full of quirky details and impassioned defenses of odd world views.  In KB, however, the dialogue is simply terrible.  The actors are given ridiculous things to say, full of posturing and bluster and stilted syntax.  None of the profanity sounds organic or natural; each F-word seems as carefully arranged and artificial as a flower arrangement.What does work is the action, which comprises the majority of the film.  Tarentino may be all about style, but he is a master of style.  So for me, watching this film was a schizophrenic experience.  I would be caught up in it, then jarred out of it again by a particularly bad piece of dialogue or gimmicky technique whose only reason for being there is that someone did the same thing in a 60s kung-fu movie.	4.0	Really 3 1/2 stars: Too obsessed with cinematic trivia	2004-05-01	3	1	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A35G33L50VL847	"David Borcherding ""gojiro"""	"...Man oh man, was I looking forward to this movie.Man oh man, was I disappointed.Don't get me wrong; I didn't *hate* Kill Bill Vol. 1. Maybe I was just pissed because what should have been one long movie got split into two films for no better reason than simple greed. Nah, that wasn't it.My major beef with this movie is that it is incredibly self-indulgent. Tarantino tosses in just about every filmmaking gimmick there is: black and white, silhouette, wires, slo-mo, etc. He overpowers the dialogue in several places by blasting out the music; I honestly do not know what they said in these spots. But worst of all, he parodies himself.Quentin needed to step back from this and get a second opinion. Perhaps his ""brother"" Robert Rodiguez. Kill Bill is terribly slow in spots, and has long segments that have no purpose in the film (e.g. the long chat with Hattori Hanzo and the subsequent argument between him and his partner). Such scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor -- or, had the film been planned better, not shot at all. Had these purposeless segments been cut, perhaps we wouldn't have to wait until February to see the second half of this film.To temper my review with some praise, let me tell you what I liked: the fight at the Blue Heron. Stupid film gimmicks aside, this long fight scene rocks. The Bride kicks ass and takes names. Unlike the long fight scenes in Matrix: Reloaded, this scene didn't get boring. Okay, Go Go's weapon was stupid, but once the reinforcements arrive, it's possibly the best fight scene ever filmed. Too bad QT had to weaken it with the black and white segment, and the silhouette fight.My final score is a three not because I think this is an average film, but because I think it is brilliant in some spots and terrible in others. They about balance out, leading to the three stars.Here's hoping Quentin's next real movie (and no, I'm not referring to Kill Bill Vol. 2, which is simply the latter half of Vol. 1 and will be more of the same) -- here's hoping Tarantino's next offering returns to the brilliance of Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1BFTKKBHIR1BY	David G. Smith	There is no such thing as an original thought, unless it is taking stuff that's already been done and turning into something else, and to me, Tarantino is a master at this.  To me, this movie was so original(it is true that I have not seen the source material).  I thought the originality never flagged, and that I was truly watching the work of a person who knows and loves films.  This is high praise from me as I normally am not the hugest fan of hype, and Tarantino carries his hype around with him. I am also not a fan of gratuitous violence. I loved this movie.As For the movieI once saw Tarantino in the Burbank airport.  I got in a conversation with him and he was&quot;flying to Mexico to shoot his movie&quot;. The movie was called Kill Bill, and then he and I got on the same airplane.  He came across affably, a charming, funny guy.  I guess I might've been scared being on the airplane with the maker of Kill Bill if I had seen it.  This is a film of unadulterated revenge.  A woman is so set on revenge that she must fight armies of people to get to her goal.  Uma Thurman turns in such a wonderfully focused performance.  The other thing is that her intensity really motivates the gallons of blood.  She is a greek tragic figure whose horrifying acts are justified by her loss.  This is Medea, Titus Andronicus, and Switchblade Sisters all in one.and the work of everyone is so fantastic.(I am waiting to see Darryl Hannah get hers).  But the blood flows almost ridiculously.  Ultimately this is shakespearean, greek, grand opera, and 70's exploitation all in one.And for all those of you who are complaining that this is not original,  I am not sure what you want.  To me, this is a hybrid of anime,(which I am not a fan of, but I thought it was beautiful and disgusting)pop culture, westerns, samurai movies and the value systems of those with no morals.  And you can never peg it.  Just when you think it is going a certain way, it shifts on you...sending you swirling into another style.I really expected that I would not like this film, and I cannot wait to see part 2.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A103KNDW8GN92L	David Hugaert	"With every cinematic masterpiece Quentin Tarantino creates, he just outdoes himself every time. ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1"" is no exception. Tarantino's style of surrealism knows no boundaries, as the display of various parts to form a unified whole always keeps the audience on their toes, leaving them scratching their heads, wondering where the story will lead and what will likely occur next. Like in another Tarantino film, 1994's ""Pulp Fiction"", ""KBV1""'s storyline is broken down into various chapters, where here there are five of these. Here is a brief summation and synopsis of each of the five chapters: Chapter One: ""2"" (aka ""'Kaboom' Goes The '...Wagon'""). The story begins in Pasadena, California, where ""Black Mamba"" (Uma Thurman) meets up with ""Copperhead"" (Vivica A. Fox). All hell will break loose, as it is here where we learn that the latter has tangled with the former in the immediate past, and that ""Black Mamba"" has vowed vengeance against ""Copperhead"" for perhaps killing her daughter. The two settle their differences in a ninja-style duel, which begins in the living room and ends in the kitchen. A human life isn't the only thing that meets a certain death here. Can you say ""KABOOM""? Chapter Two: ""The Blood-Splattered Bride"". In El Paso, Texas, it is discovered that nine people were shot dead during a wedding ceremony at a local chapel, and two ""Texas Rangers"" happen upon the scene and do some Texas style investigating. Upon closer inspection, it is learned that one of the nine victims is ""Black Mamba"" herself, who later wakes up from a trance-like coma. Weirdness then ensues, as a couple of sex-crazed hospital employees attempt to take advantage of our unconscious ""Damsel In Distress"". Daryl Hannah is featured in this segment as the ""Eyepatch Villainess"", who obviously has a personal vendetta against the ""Yellow Haired Mamba One"" as well. The ""Pussy Wagon"" makes yet another appearance here. Chapter Three: ""The Case Of O-Ren Ishii"". An animated feature, this part of the story reveals how a very young female Samurai warrior went from a kind, righteous girl to an evil woman. As the story goes, O-Ren underwent a strict traing regimen, as taught by her father, whom O-Ren kills as a result of the abuse she has taken from him after all these years. As it turns out, this young warrior matures in her craft, taking vengeance on all who stand in her way. By her young adult years, she has graduated into Samurai warriorhood. It is at this point in the story where the animators who put this piece together should be given high praise for their top-notch artwork and animation mechanics, as well as for Tarantino himself for capturing the pure essence of this segment. This is definitely Blue Ribbon material. Chapter Four: ""The Man From Okinawa"". Here, things really start to move full steam ahead, as our yellow-haired female hero takes up residence in Japan to learn to become a full-fledged Samurai warrior. Black Mamba sets out to seek revenge against the people who put her in a coma, as well as those who killed her daughter. The yellow-haired one is then given a place of residence, where she begins training with a highly skilled instructor (Sonny Chiba). Soon, heads will roll, literally! Chapter Five: ""Showdown At The Blue Leaves Room"" (aka ""Vengence Is Mine, Sayeth The Noble Buddah""). In the final chapter of this Part 1 saga, Black Mamba meets up with her arch-nemisis, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). These ladies have a major score to settle - would you believe at a Japanese style rock concert & party, of all venues? It is here (in Tokyo) where all hell will break loose, and many lives are in danger, including our blond heroine's (WARNING: Not for those with weak stomachs, as well as those who faint at the sight of a certain shade of red). Again, Quentin Tarantino does a masterful job of keeping his audience firmly planted on the edge of their seats, and lets the audience become a contributing factor to the outcome of the story. How so? By giving ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1"" a mystery murder-type premise, therefore letting the people excercise their brains to let them decide who the innocent bystanders and who the guilty parties are, as depicted in the movie. So, all that needs to be cleared up is whether or not Black Mamba's daughter is dead or alive, as one of her tormentors is made well aware of. ""KBV1"" is definitely worthy of several viewings, and will leave you saying to yourself: ""I can't wait until Vol. 2 comes out"" (which will be in 2004). That one is sure to be another winner for ""The Q Man"" as well, as both films come highly recommended for the ultimate movie viewing experience.

But Kill Bill Vol 1 really bowed me over and I have watched some of the sequences over and over and its the little details that hit you.- Sonny Chiba and his side kick exchange over the warm sake and Uma remaining amused and at one point having to duck her head.- great soundtrack ...the whistling in the hospital by Elle, the presentation of the sword to Uma scene with the soundtrack and the climatic cliffhanger 'Is she aware that her daughter is still alive' tying in with the music hits you hard .- the Jap anime was superb and of course showing Jap society perversions and cultural idiosyncracies...Gogo's giddle at Uma 'begging'typical of Jap women- notice one little glib though  ... Uma Death List Five ... the list used in the Pussy Wagon at the beginning of the movie(after she just killed Black Mama) and the one drawn up in the plane(when she was on the way to killed Oren - final scene sequence ) was different ... one heading in Capital letters and the other in small caps .. could QT have put this in deliberately or was there an oversight due several list props floating in the movie studio?	5.0	Solid Stuff	2004-04-03	3	1	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	APS7BJ7605MNT	David L. Ricks	Few directors show such an obvious love of the cinema than Tarantino, and his fondness for revenge and kung-fu flicks is now up on the big screen for all to see.  Plain and simply, it's a revenge story concerning Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) who's wedding day is ruined when Bill and her former assasin friends gatecrash the party and massacre everyone when she tries to start a new life.  Leaving her for dead, she wakes up from a coma four years later and seeks revenge.  Simple.  What we then get is a perfect anime and Bruce Lee pastiche dripping from the screen in a torrent of cartoon Itchy and Scratchy type blood as each former friend is sought out and eliminated.In no other movie and with no other director would you laugh with anticipation at the sight of a hospital orderly running a bizzarre brothel using the coma patients as hookers!

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2JXAQ92WYPAAR	"David Schweizer ""Almawood"""	"American film makers have a tendency to follow a certain career cycle. At first, they seek studio approval, so they make a couple of films to the specification of pushy producers or totally independently but on low budget. Either way, their initial successes are then followed up by the grand opus syndrome. Coppola is a case in point. So is Bertolucci. There are other boy-wonders who have fallen into the trap of believing their own hype, as have the studios who ultimately green-light whatever their favorites come up with, including ideas without story-lines. ""Kill Bill"" is going to please some, as it should. It is, after all, rather different, and does celebrate a certain genre that no doubt many find appealing. That said, the slaughter-house opening struck me an over-indulgent rather than artistic. Don't get me wrong. I loved ""Pulp Fiction."" But this is ""Pulp Fiction"" without the brilliant story-telling. This is lots of effects, but no acting.  No doubt some would have it that this is exactly what the director had in mind. I'll give Tarantino credit for pulling off what he set out to make, but from my point of view the fact that the director had fun making his film is not the same thing as the audience having fun watching it."	3.0	Genius Unleashed	2008-01-01	2	2	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2QWXHB5IU8LCU	David W. George	"I liked this film so much more than I thought I would. It clearly does not take itself too seriously; the trademark violence found in every Quentin Tarantino flick is present here also, but it's so over the top, it's cartoonish. Supposedly, gallons upon gallons of fake blood were used in the making of ""Kill Bill"", which was originally intended to be released as one complete, 3+ hour movie, but then it was split into two volumes so as not to make the moviegoer sit through a marathon, as in the case of the three ""Lord Of The Rings"" films.Uma Thurman stars as ""The Bride"" (her real name is revealed in ""Volume 2""), who is left for dead by her former boss Bill (David Carradine)and his ""Deadly Viper Assassination Squad"", aka ""DiVAS"", on what apparantly was to be her wedding day. It is not disclosed in ""Volume 1"" why she was targeted for death, but needless to say, after awakening from a four year coma, she is pretty bent on revenge. Thurman has developed into a solid actress, and she carries ""Volume 1"" through it's hour and forty-five minute running time. The other ""DiVAS"" are played by Daryl Hannah, Vivica A. Fox, Lucy Liu(whose death at the hands of ""The Bride"" is rather spectacular), and Michael Madsen.There aren't a great deal of extras on the DVD, although I did appreciate the inclusion of trailers from all of Tarantino's films, even the teaser for ""Kill Bill Volume 2"". The DVD is worth buying, however, for the simple fact that Tarantino has created one-half of what could potentially be his best work. Yes, there will probably be a ""Kill Bill"" box set, which would merge the two films as a whole, as it was intended. Why wait, though? This is one of the best films of 2003, and a lot of people, including me, didn't go to the theater to see it. I won't make that mistake again for ""Volume 2""."	5.0	Tarantino's Violent Cheese-Fest	2004-04-17	0	0	0

I had to stop watching after a time. The whole sequence was more like middle school amateur acting, with senseless and inexplicable, gratuitous violence, knifing, shooting, near rape and all what not.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1P5M817CRQLTC	D. Cohen	As the previous reviewer stated. The pricing structure for UMD's is absolutely ludicrous. I understand the ones priced at $19.99, but that seems as if it should be the upper limit. Pricing discs for $29.99 for a no frills UMD is unbelievable. Hopefully SONY will realize people aren't going to pay thirty dollars for a movie they already own on DVD just so they can watch it on their PSP. They will buy one or two movies as I plan to. Solely for the coolness factor. Nobody is going to own a movie collection on their PSP though, unless they are rich. Even rich people will likely be angry about being price gouged. Sony needs to wake up and start pricing these discs inline with DVD's at the most. Pricing them above the DVD cost is absurd.	1.0	What a Joke	2005-04-15	14	4	10

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A23GFTVIETX7DS	Debbie Lee Wesselmann	&quot;Kill Bill, Volume 1&quot; is difficult to rate.  The plot can be described in a single sentence, the characterization is almost nil, the violence is graphic and gratuitous, and yet . . . Tarantino delivers a film unlike any other.  The &quot;chapter&quot; divisions between scenes, the interspersed gritty-textured black and white segments, and the superb soundtrack give it an art-house feel while the highly choreographed, over-the-top fight scenes (which comprise at least ninety percent of the movie) recall the classy &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot; as well as a long heritage of martial arts films.  The gore itself is pure horror film, but in the context of Tarantino's carefully set up noir atmosphere, it has a bizarre elegance of its own.The plot?  A former assassin (Uma Thurman) seeks revenge on those who tried to kill her and her unborn baby years before.  In this, the first volume of a film broken in two, the assassin (known both as The Bride and Black Mamba) manages to face only two out of the five on her list.  Nearly two hours to exact revenge on two people and ninety percent of the film is fighting?  You got it.  Okay, there are some (graphic) flashbacks.  And a fifty or so man Tokyo gangster (graphic) diversion.  And some keen visual humor thrown in. But mostly, we see Uma Thurman in sleek, seventies-style garb wield her knives and swords as no other woman in cinema has.It's a shame Tarantino could not part with scenes from the final fight, which seems to last for an eternity, so he could combine both &quot;Kill Bill&quot; films into one.  This one ends so abruptly and with so much unfinished business that it really cannot be considered complete without its second half.  Take the R rating seriously; only mature teens and older should watch this since the violence is glamorized and desensitizes even the adult viewer.  Full of profanity, raw aggression, and blood, this film is definitely not for everyone.I give this film three stars for plot and concept, but five stars for style.  Although as a stand-alone film, it doesn't hold together the way &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; does, the second volume promises to provide the coherence and significance.  Plan to follow-up your viewing with Volume Two.	4.0	Stylized - and stylish - gore	2004-04-28	2	1	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3GQKB1KF0CRPE	"Deborah MacGillivray ""Author,"""	First, if you've watched previous Tarantino films and disliked them, skip Kill Bill - both volumes.  It is pure QT from start to finish.  Same, if you don't like Uma Thurman (I am shocked there are some who do not!), you might want to skip as well.  However, if you like QT's quirky humour and oddball films, then you will love Kill Bill - Part 1 mind you!  This is truly the first half of the Kill Bill set.  So, expect the blunt ending that leaves you hanging.  It starts with the old Drive-in lead clip giving you a hint this movie is gash for the B-film addict's soul.  With soundtracks from everywhere and bits and pieces stolen - homage? - to other films, then remade in QT magic, it's a film buff's trivia delight.In TQ style, you are given puzzle pieces that eventually fit together to present the whole story.  Thurman - rather preggers and on her wedding day - is attacked by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.  The whole wedding party is taken out in abloodbath, with the unseen Bill putting a bullet to Thurman's head at the end of it.  When the police arrive, they find Thurman not dead and rush her to hospital, where she stays in coma for over four years.  Once she awakens, she finds it kill or be killed.  So, she set out on her adventure to kill the five people on her list - Bill being the last.Everyone was Kung-Fu dancing, with tongue-through-cheek, in some of the wildest ninja fight scenes.  QT's brilliant, quirky wit shines in that totally indefinable way of his.  But it's Thurman who is the WOW of this show.  She alternates between her homely - breathtaking beauty, as the scene calls for it, and makes the total absurdity believable.If you like QT, you will love Kill Bill Vol 1.  If you have not liked him, then forgetaboutit...you will hate it.	5.0	Uma dazzles	2004-06-02	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3S7WU6DIH71CC	Denny Vu Quach	"""Kill Bill"" is an anomaly in today's Hollywood culture. Here is a movie that neither makes you think too hard nor tears at you heartstrings--and it is a truly excellent flick. Under the shrewd (and possibly insane) hands of Quentin Tarantino, ""Kill Bill"" details an ultrally brutal and even more emotionally statisfying quest for revenge.Beat to a bloody pulp and shot in the head and left for dead at her wedding day, The Bride (Uma Thurman, whose name is never revealed) is carted away in a four-year-long coma. She wakes up and vows revenge. And, oh, does Thurman play revenge well. It seems that the supporting cast (Lucy Lui, Vivica A. Fox, among others) truly beat Thurman to the edge of death. Her eyes convey her emotion--the limited and brief dialogue isn't even necessary. She is surpremely convincing in every aspect of her performance, even throughout the amazingly stylish fight sequences (which put ""The Matrix"" to shame). She fights like a pro with samurai swords, lethal daggers, butcher knives, and frying pans.One of the main draws to this redefining adventure is the hilarious subject matter. Tarantino goes overboard. Blood flies about like fruit punch, gushing out of wounds like a torrential downpour (sometimes, in fact, you will even wonder if the human body has that much blood), and in any other movie, that gore would force you to leave--but here, it doesn't. Why? Because Tarantino never takes himself too seriously. Fight scenes are punctuated with effective and sometimes laughable dialogue. But beneath the hokey action scenes and the cute quips, there is a real movie at work here. Tarantino dances about the timeline, bouncing the story back and forth to a dizzying point, which forces your full attention on the gradually unfolding general story. The cliffhanger ending merely seals the deal.""Kill Bill"" deserves all of the accolades it gets. Although it may seem to be a hackfest on the surface, there is true talent at work here. Uma Thurman and Lucy Lui give inspiring performances; the story, however linear it may be, it instantly grabbing; and Tarantino's masterful direction is as inspiringly as it is slightly distubring.

PQ 4/5 and AQ 5/5.Tarantino serves up another over the top and funny, yet violent martial arts revenge film. It is artistically executed visually, and many of his shots remain in my mind (like the blue one where the fighters are silhuettes, and the black and white shot with Uma Thurman who is about to be shot). The story itself is told in several parts, which allows the viewer to absorb each stage of Uma's revenge. To offset some of the extremely violent scenes, Tarantino inflects plenty of humor (Uma writing the ""Death List"" in a progressively larger and larger font, and with 2 colors), and the scene where slams the orderly's head in the door). It allows the audience to enjoy this visually stunning, yet violent film, while also laughing. The latter creates a bit of guilt in the grand scheme of things, but the film manages to balance both and create fantastic entertainment value. Some of the scenes are necessarily over the top, in the style of the classic kung fu movies, and Tarantino brings back that ""old school"" feel with the score itself, sound effects and various visual styles. There are many great scenes in this film, and fans of the film, will enjoy the Blu-Ray upgrade."	4.0	Tarantino style, and tongue in cheek revengue romp	2009-08-02	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2WP0GOTX13MG4	"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff"""	In the &quot;Making Of&quot; bonus feature, Quentin Tarantino says he thought it'd be really cool to make a revenge flick.  Indeed.  Revenge abounds in &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, and it ain't pretty.&quot;Kill Bill&quot; tells the story of &quot;The Bride,&quot; played by Uma Thurman, who after spending four years in a coma, wakes up to take revenge on those that put her there.  Oh yeah, when she was sent to the coma, she was very pregnant, and this only fuels her rage.Volume One focuses on the Bride waking from her coma,  acquiring &quot;Japanese Steel&quot; from a legendary sword maker (who, bye the way, has a pretty cool back story that can be found in the DVD extras), and taking revenge on two of the DiVAS (the assasin group that put her in the coma) on her way to tracking down Bill.The first two victims of the Bride's revenge are played by Vivica Fox and Lucy Liu.  Fox plays Vernita Green, the Copperhead, who has distanced herself from the assasination business and concentrates on raising a family.  She has an excellent duel, which is interrupted by Green's daughter coming home, that Tarantino has suggested might be the focus of a third Kill Bill movie.  Fox was perfect in the part, injecting the right amount of attitude and sass, and dealing out great verbal jabs to go with the physical one.Liu plays O-ren Ishii, a Chinese-Japanese American that has risen to the head of the Yakuza crime world in Tokyo, Japan.  Her back story was told in an anime sequence, which did the job, but through me for a loop.  Liu does an excellent job playing a ruthless criminal leader, which is a departure from her usual roles.Tarantino's movie was a test of his limits.  He even says so himself in the bonus features.  While there is a story, it takes a back seat to the characters, dialogue, and plenty of gory action.  His focus seems to be on making memorable scenes, not necessarily memorable movies.  There is nothing wrong with that, because the end product benefits.Tarantino combined all the influences into this movie.  The best part is that he managed to combine an old western, a Japanese Samurai story, and a mob story into one exhaustive tale that makes for a good revenge flick.  The music and sound further the atmosphere.I really enjoyed this movie.  As mentioned earlier, the action, dialogue, and characters make the movie, and the story takes a back seat.  One thing to watch out for is the level of gore.  It reaches an all time high in this movie, with literally, geysers of blood that spray from the victims.  Blood is everywhere, so don't say you haven't been warned if you are squeemish.  If you had any problems with Tarantino's &quot;Reservoir Dogs,&quot; then you'll have a hard time with this one.I tempted to give the movie five stars, but I'm taking one away simply because I think the amount of blood was increased simply for shock value in parts and the story could have been a little more developed.  In addition, the DVD is light on extras, which I imagine has something to do that it is being released right on top of the theatrical release of Volume 2.  I suppose in the near future, we'll get a double disk set with a ton of bonus features, to be followed up in a few years with another edition with even more features.There is a lot to talk about this movie, and if I hit everything, I'd be spoiling it and this review would come out to long, but its definitely worth a viewing or two.	4.0	. . . and Everyone Else	2004-04-17	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A7LXWJYEKPQTT	D. J. Richardson	"Look, I don't know about this movie.  This movie is done well, dont get me wrong.  If you are a fan of violence and revenge than this is your movie, that is for sure.  I admire the artistic nature of the film and I think Tarantino is a unique artist, in general - but he is no genius.  Using violence to grab an audience, and shock to wow the audience, is nothing new or astonishing.  Strip out the over the top production and what are you left with?  This is a pretty vulgar movie that is a bit upsetting, really.  I am noticing a pattern in tarantino's work - an obsession with ultra violence and rape - and that is simply not a quality theme in my book.  This is pure entertainment, that borders along junk food for the brain.  Junk food tastes good, but has no nutritional value.This is simply not my thing, but this could work for some people - ok, a lot of people.  It is fast paced, balls out, action for action in the most intense way - with a fabulous soundtrack and a general ""coolness"" that is captivating.  It gives respectable nods to kung fu classics and amps up the production to stellar form.However, I dont find the witty dialogue from Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction present in this movie- and for me, that was Tarantino's saving grace in past movies.I guess the point is, know what you are getting yourself into when you watch this movie.  I valued the unique direction of this movie, but this is not for everyone.  It wasn't for me."	2.0	I think I am going to get slammed for this rating...	2005-03-11	9	0	9
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1XX5797TIZT5Q	D. Mok	Having just seen Kill Bill, Vol. 2, I can confirm that the interviews and press reports are accurate:  By splitting one film into two, what you get are two halves that each has its own very pronounced merits, but need each other to survive.  In fact, I think if the two volumes had cross-pollinated a little more, you wouldn't have had just a good movie and a half, but two great films.But for now, Kill Bill Vol. 1.  It's the &quot;action&quot; half of the twins, and it dazzles right from the start with an audacious, extended extreme close-up on Uma Thurman's face.  The scene after, the duel between The Bride and Vernita Green, is classic Quentin Tarantino, heralding a return to his outrageous, dramatically intense roots.  Probably the strongest scene he's directed since the Mr. Pink-Mr. White altercation in Reservoir Dogs.  Unfortunately, after The Bride wakes up from her coma, the dramatic content flies down the meter, with a lot of posing and one-liners but very little in terms of character or emotional satisfaction.  Which means it's up to the endless action set pieces to grab our attention.  And they do.  However, I find them a little too bloody, even though I've spent the last 16 months digging through Shaw Brothers films (through the excellent Celestial Pictures VCD and DVD releases).  The endless bloodletting in Kill Bill Vol. 1 is shocking in the beginning, but after about five minutes in the extended climactic massacre, it's numbing.And for the record, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is not a Shaw Brothers kind of film, despite the Shaw logo which opens the film.  You would have to wait until the &quot;training&quot; sequences in Vol. 2 to get Shaw Brothers-style cinema (which Tarantino appropriates very well there).  Vol. 1 is much more a paean to the Japanese style of filmmaking:  Extremely saturated colours courtesy of cinematographer Robert Richardson (even Shaw films didn't go this far in terms of garish colours -- we're in '80s Kurosawa territory here), emphasis on extreme wide shots, the very long builds, the brilliant music by The RZA.  And the martial-arts sequences are modern in their multi-angularity and speed cuts; Shaw Brothers action as epitomized by Chang Cheh's style focuses much more on choreography and mise en scene than multi-angularity, letting long medium shots capture the movement of the actors and fighters, relying very little on cuts.All in all, the most lacking element in Kill Bill Vol. 1 is still story and character.  Uma Thurman has some great moments (such as when The Bride first wakes up in the hospital), but after those blazing first 30 minutes, she will mostly become a statuesque hellfire angel who doesn't have a great deal of emotional advancement.  You will get that in spades in Vol. 2, which is hands down a superior story and film -- without the visual eye candy and endless action of Vol. 1, but with such powerful dramatic moments that it barely matters.  Again, I think if Tarantino had been able to meld the action and the drama a little more, rather than separate them into two movies that contain most of one and almost none of the other, he would have made both films greater than what they are.  As it stands, Vol. 2 will be what truly burns these characters and Tarantino's vision into your mind, while Vol. 1 is the adrenalized thrill ride with energy to spare, but without much in terms of thematic depth.	4.0	Virtuosic filmmaking that needs a little more substance.	2004-04-24	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3RTMB76CJWY9U	DonAthos	"There was a time when science-fiction was considered mere pulp trash. It didn't matter to the kids back then--they loved it. They snuck their comics under the covers at night with a flashlight and played hookey in order to see the latest serial at the cinema. When they grew up, they wanted to bring that childhood love of theirs to the big screen, with one change: they wanted their movies to be respected.And so, we have Star Wars, and the modern Battlestar Galactica and Firefly/Serenity. Sci-fi isn't mere pulp, anymore (if ever it truly was), no matter what the older generations might continue to feel.Tarantino's plan is roughly the same, though his role-models are different. He's a fan of the action-packed 70s flicks. Kill Bill, vol. 1, is his ode to Kung Fu extravaganzas, with one change: respectability.It's not a very complicated plot. Uma Thurman (""the Bride"") was beaten into a coma on her wedding day, and now looks for revenge against those what done the beating (and especially their leader, Bill). The movie is about her gaining that revenge, usually through long and gory fight sequences.Tarantino earns the respect he craves for his Martial Arts movie by 1) having quality actors fulfill the roles, 2) an awesome score, featured prominently (par for Tarantino's course) and 3) a variety of interesting and always changing visual and narrative styles. He shifts from black and white to color to animated sequences to flashbacks and back again. Neither the camera angles nor the kill-shots (and there are a bunch!) are ever duplicated. Everyone is provocatively dressed and distinctive, each sequence has its own feel, pacing and rhythm. A two-hour long Kung Fu movie with non-stop action could become boring. Tarantino never allows it.That is his genius.It turns out that every genre of film can be ""good art."" I'm not sure whether Kill Bill would be the first ""artistic"" martial arts movie, or if it even matters. What matters to me is that this movie is a lot of fun--gruesome, violent fun. A striking film that students of cinema, and fans of old-time karate action alike, must see."	5.0	Karate Flick as Cinematic Art	2006-09-08	3	3	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1EZMV5DSWU8TU	Draconis Blackthorne	"An intersting use of 70's past orthodoxy Martial Arts films, from language to aesthetics to music, with the inclusion of what may be considered current attractiveness with the female characters in the film, who take prominance as far as major roles are concerned. ""The Bride/Black Mamba"" {a blonde Uma Thurman} must gain vengeance for injustuces levelled against her which takes her all the way to Japan, where she trains with a Samurai Master to prepare for a duel to the death with her nemesis, an Amerasian beauty who leads a network of Yakuza. She is presented with a special katana sword likened a veritable Excalibur for this purpose. Vignettes illustrate the personal circumstances of the major characters which lead to their paths of battle, and cross-interpolations between the other warrior women.David Carradine {Kwai Chang Caine himself} acts as a sort of ""Bosley"" to a secret organization of sexy assassins reminiscent of ""Charlie's Angels"", whom he leads to eliminate certain threats to his organization, which initially included The Bride who fell into a coma, although because of the Bushido code, is spared in favor of an eventual honorable bout. While in her coma, she is raped repeatedly by an orderly named ""Chuck"", who had begun bringing others for this pseudo-necrophiliac activity. She gains her revenge against them as well.The Bride wears a yellow jumpsuit with the black line up the side, a-la Bruce Lee, during a mass cluster fight with black-suited subordinates, and the protagonist are female, eventually meeting in a ridiculously bloody battle between she and the villainess' forces, which includes a cutely psychotic schoolgirl and a military general. The bloodshed spurts like jet fountains, and reminded Me of the scene in The Addams Family wherein Wednesday and Pugsley were performing at the PTA event, with the words ""A hit! A very palpable hit!"" comes to mind.Overall, an impressive ""scalping"" occurs, an impalement, and various ubiquitous feats of extraordinary acrobatics."	3.0	Kwai Chang Caine returns!	2005-06-23	3	0	3
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3VQLTB724O77W	Dr. Christopher Coleman	"I'm not convinced.  Okay, so there were references.  Hundreds of them, many of which I surely missed.  And many of which unquestionably pleased Quentin Tarentino, but did little for me.  And yes, it was stylish, wonderfully visual, drawing from a huge range of styles.But it was silly.  Just...Plain...(dramatic pause, last word spoken in Japanese)...Silly.Okay, willing suspension of disbelief is one thing, and I grant that I didn't have enough of this.  If I'd have approached the movie as filmic manga, then I should have appreciated it.  But instead I approached it as a Quentin Tarentino film; a movie by a guy who loves stylised violence, sure, but who also loves plots with more twists than an anaconda committing sepuku, who writes crazed, wild and unexpected dialogue and whose films never quite let you know where they're going, and when you get there you're thoroughly satisfied about HOW you got there even as you wipe the blood off your brow.None of this was true of Kill Bill.  Yes, we're not yet at the end, but this whole movie was a video game of gore with not a plot in sight.  The dialogue is lame, the acting--well, there just isn't any.  There's loads of stunt work, but no real acting.  (I was greatly amused by the reviewer who thinks there wasn't any wire work in this...I've got a bridge for him!)  And yes, Uma's gorgeous and so is Lucy, and Darryl's not bad either if you like chicks with eye patches, but they're not given anything to do except give each other cold stares.  Kill Bill Vol. 1 was a real disappointment; not so much that it was unwatchable, but I'm not particularly looking forward to Volume 2 at all.  Hopefully, once Tarentino gets this ""homage"" business out of his system he'll get back to doing what he does so very well.

His signature ""shock and awe"" style of action is all here, and the sword-fighting in this film is some of the best I've ever seen.My only minor complaint is that I think he shouldn't have cast Uma Thurman to play the role of The Bride, but hey, whatever floats his boat (which has now long floated by for this film).  As far as the Blu-ray is concerned, the picture is 5-star quality, and the sound is crystal-clear.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3U20DIY3TCSNI	drew m	Kill Bill is an unholy mess of a film, so scattershot that director Quentin Tarantino can't even bring himself to settle on one single font for all the different titles that appear on screen (and there are many).  It's as if Tarantino is trying to make seven or eight different movies at once, and that's the ultimate downfall of Kill Bill.  That is, it has no consistent tone whatsoever.Tarantino spends the majority of Kill Bill training his camera on whatever particular fetish he's interested in at the moment, be it extended shots of Uma Thurman's feet, lingering scenes featuring Film Geek hero Sonny Chiba, and a parade of uber-violent moments that are cartoonish one moment and disturbing the next.  Is it exciting?  Occasionally.  But Tarantino doesn't have enough of an attention span to make the audience care.  He's looking to show off how many styles he has mastery over.  That's fun for him, not so fun for us.What made Tarantino such an exciting filmmaker in the early 90's was his discipline.  Even Reservoir Dogs - no G-rated flick by any stretch - had Tarantino staging the most violent moments off camera.  With Pulp Fiction, he fashioned his brilliant dialogue into a consistently engaging plot.  Because Tarantino is a filmmaker (not to mention person) of such manic energy, his restraint made all the difference.  A filtered Tarantino is a good one.  We don't need to see his entire id unleashed.But Kill Bill makes no such concessions.  There is no focus on dialogue or plot.  There's just a focus on STUFF, and the movie suffers as a result.  Case in point: Lucy Liu's O-Ren Ishii highlights a hilarious sequence in a Japanese boardroom.  But that scene comes after slogging through an endless anime sequence so humorless I almost took a cyanide pill with my Sprite.  It's not that either piece is lacking in quality.  It's just that they don't really fit together.Another example comes from Thurman's scenes in the hospital.  One moment, we're pulled in by an excruciating sequence where Thurman's Bride wakes up and realizes what has happened to her.  The next moment we're supposed to laugh at the fact that a hospital worker has been renting out Thurman's comatose body to ...truckers.  Again, it's a lousy fit, and it highlights Tarantino's weakness for self-indulgence.This will, of course, make no difference to most fanboys.  After all, Tarantino is the official Fanboy Made Good.  And his life certainly makes for a great story.  Kill Bill, however, does not.(Note: It's worth mentioning that Kill Bill is by far Tarantino's most violent film.  It is not for the squeamish, and if you are turned off by extreme gore, you'd best be warned.)	2.0	Consistency in Not Quentin's Middle Name	2003-10-14	7	4	3

Like a cinematic Wanderlei Silva, this is an action picture that just does not stop throwing haymakers until it's finished, and I love it for that simple-minded dedication to its own nature. Uma Thurman is surprisingly well suited for the role of the double-crossed professional killer on a blood vendetta, as she rampages from one gory smackdown to the next without lifting her icy mask for more than a wink and a nod. The plot is simple enough, with Thurman literally carrying a list of the five heads she's out to collect with her from scene to scene, but doubles down on thick atmosphere and detailed dossiers on every major player. Though it's sliced in half with all the abruptness of a katana slash, the story's split doesn't bother me a bit; in a way it's an appropriate intermission, as the two very different halves are able to stand on their own without getting in each other's way. Masterfully orchestrated chaos, it's impossible to turn away from the Bride's classic exaggerated fight scene with the Crazy 88s.	5.0	A Celebration of Overkill, Soaked With Blood and Matched with a Perfect Soundtrack	2012-04-16	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3GBMUKR3B1EZ6	dssd	"It's become pretty well known through publicity that this is Tarantino's fourth film, so how does it rank up against his others? Well, as much as I love Reservoir Dogs, it hasn't dated too well. Especially when compared to Pulp Fiction which basically became a classic the year it was released. He followed with Jackie Brown which was (in my eyes) a great movie, but others disagreed. After a six year hiatus from directing, America finds out that Tarantino's next movie is going to be a revenge flick centered around a woman who was left for dead on her wedding day (even though it turned out to be dress rehearsal). I wasn't exactly thrilled about the idea of the man doing a straight-action movie, but all doubts were thrown out the window during the first frame of Kill Bill. The Bride lays there helpless; crying; bloodied up. The audience doesn't know exactly what happened here, but it becomes obvious when we hear Bill ask her, ""Do you find me sadistic?"" The Bride's shot in the head and the credits immediately pop up with that haunting song on the soundtrack.""The 4th Film By Quentin Tarantino.""It was then that I realized that Tarantino had not ""sold out."" Not even one minute into the movie yet and it's already flooded with the style of filmmaking he's known for.I absolutely adored this movie. It's the most exciting action saga to come out of Hollywood for quite a while. Some might call it trash, but it's smart trash. Technically, the film is a marvel to behold. Tarantino loves what he does and it shows in every frame of the movie. He does plagarize a few things here and there, but the cues work so well that someone who appreciates the art of filmmaking won't mind at all.The script is terrific, though some argued that Tarantino was a bit stingy with his infamous dialogue in this particular volume. I'll agree with this to a point. The dialogue in his movies is simply cool and one of the main reasons I enjoy his stuff so much, but the lack of it in Kill Bill doesn't hurt the film one bit. Here, it's mostly about the craft of making a movie that excites the audience but doesn't cater to the lowest common demoniator by dumbing the material down. In fewer words: lack of extensive dialogue doesn't hurt the film.The characters are a hoot to watch. Thurman plays the Bride straight-faced; the only way to do it. You don't even see David Carradine as Bill in this one too much, but in Volume 2, he's a wonder to behold. A true scene-stealer. Doubt the Academy has the balls to nominate him for a film like this, though. Lucy Liu is the somber, yet deadly, O-Ren Ishii. The character is fleshed out in a gloriously violent anime segment and isn't tossed off as ""just another bad guy."" The character of Go-Go Yubari, however, is just one of O-Ren's cronies. But, for want of a better word, she simply rocks. Definitely my favorite secondary character of the series. Sonny Chiba also makes a funny cameo as Hattori Hanzo, creator of the Bride's ""steel.""So, is this Tarantino's best movie yet? In my opinion: yes. If you love movies, see Kill Bill. Both volumes.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AYB3CG5IVMTSN	Dustin Merton	the opening scene of this movie really sets you up for the type of movie you are about to see.  from the get go you feel that your eyes cannot be removed from the screen.  after the first scene you jump 4 years later to uma thurman pulling up to a quiet suburban neighborhood in bright yellow truck with pink flames that has pu**y wagon enblazoned on the end of the truck.  she has arrived at her second victim of retribution codenamed copperhead.  this character is played by the gorgeous vivaca fox.  the two women fight and are at a stalemate until vivaca's little girl interupts them.  there is some very funny dialogue that goes on during this scene and some words that are spoken that speak of regret.  needless to say this scene ends in death but at the unfortunate tragedy of being witnessed by the little girl.  this movie jumps around a little bit like pulp fiction did, however this is not a bad thing b/c there is never any interruption in the flow of the movie.  there is a part that reveals that uma's character had the possibility of neveer waking up from her coma, and this scene is both tragic and funny, darryl hannah is wickedly funny.  i think that this first movie is really set up wonderfully because there is a depth to the characters, and by doing this you get a feel for who they are and what they represent.  lucy liu does a great job also and plays vicious killer very well.  in all honesty i felt a little sorry for her and how she grew up.  this movies a perfect set up for the second volume of this tragedy.  my biggest question for the second volume is what did the bride do to make her former team try to kill her?  the movie really leaves the watcher hanging and brings up a whole new set of questions and speculations to be answered especially when the viewer finds out that the bride's daughter is still alive.  all the actors in this movie fill out their parts fantastically well.  and like i said, this movie has all the elements of a great tragedy and revenge movie, but it also has some very funny parts as well.  i love the part where uma is trying to get her toe to wiggle.  this is a great tarantino movie and is a very visceral movie with lots of blood and violence but at the heart is still human.  this a great movie and i cant wait to see the second one.	5.0	a wonderful action drama w/a sense of humor	2004-04-15	0	0	0

But there is alot  of blood gushing scenes in this movie. And them in some parts of the movie they even had to make it black and white,then one of the funniest parts was when there was one more guy to kill left and her was like 16 years old and she turned him around and started  to spank  with the sword. Then there was one more person left and she was the boss so she was gonna be hard to fight .I really liked this movie,and I recomend this movie for everybody.	4.0	kill bill	2004-07-15	3	0	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ	"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"""Kill Bill"" was either a disaster-in-the-making or a one of a kind hit -- a sprawling revenge flick that had to be cut in two and released separately. But director Quentin Tarantino serves up entertainingly mindless gore and twisted thrills in ""Kill Bill Volume 1,"" a salute to homages.Tragedy strikes the Bride (Uma Thurman) on her wedding day: The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS) attacks and slaughters the guests, the groom, and wounds the very pregnant Bride herself. Her former boss/lover Bill (David Carradine) finishes the bloodbath by shooting the Bride in the head. But despite his efforts, she isn't dead.A few years later, the Bride wakes to find that she has been in a coma for a few years, and has been being used as a sex toy for rent. After recovering enough to move, the Bride gets a sword sharp enough to ""cut God,"" and goes on a revenge spree against the people who wrecked her life and killed her baby, including Cottonmouth (Vivica A. Fox) and the deadly O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu).Don't expect cinematic art in ""Kill Bill Volume 1."" If anything, this is cinematic pop art, a loving tribute to cheesy martial-arts flicks and westerns. Tarantino even inserts a stretch of anime detailing O-Ren's background. It's pure Tarantino, untainted by typical directing methods and immensely entertaining if you switch off your critical faculties, refrain from asking ""How the heck could that happen?""""Kill Bill"" isn't for the weak of stomach; over 450 gallons of fake blood are used in both movies. But the blood usage is more ""Monty Python"" than ""Braveheart""; it's so over-the-top that it's silly and sick rather than disturbing. So is the violence -- hacking dozens of people down without getting so much as a scrape is impossible, but it's sure fun to watch.Tarantino throws out more one-liners than just about any other filmmaker around. The absurd ""Trix is for kids"" line aside, there are a number of great lines like ""Those of you lucky enough to have your lives take them with you. However, leave the limbs you've lost. They belong to me now."" The script teems with impossibilities, but they seem plausible enough in this alternate reality that Tarantino has cooked up. Call it Tarantinoland.Uma Thurman, with her yellow tracksuit and katana, rules the screen as the Bride. Despite the Bride cutting down people by the dozen, it's impossible not to appreciate her. And the best supporting performances come from Liu as the ruthless O-Ren, Carradine in a brief but intense appearance, and the wonderful, underrated Chiaki Kuriyama as evil schoolgirl Go-Go Yubari.It's silly, it's creepy, it's gaudy, and somehow it's vastly entertaining. Tarantino's special triumph in ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" is to somehow rope his vast store of movie homages into a gory, action-packed storyline, and one that is, at the very least, hard to forget."	5.0	She's gonna kill Bill	2007-07-15	2	2	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AXTN353N1CPQN	Eclectically Inclined	Having seen both Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction(and loving both!) I purchased used(thank God) both volumes of Kill Bill.  Having just finished watching Volume 1, I felt compelled to express my utter dislike for this movie. So here I am.This movie had a good first half. It did. Entertaining. Not as entertaining as Dogs or Pulp(can anything surpass Pulp?) but nevertheless held some interest.  But the last half took me down quickly.  It was so over the top, so saturated with silly, bloody fight scenes which were too drawn out, too cheesy, and no real surprises that not only did I lose interest, I could not wait for the unrealistic  blood bath to end.  I won't be watching this one again.  Why would I?  The dialogue was more than lacking.  The action was too unreal. Way over the top!  Over the top can be a good thing. But TOO MUCH of a good thing can become a bad thing.  This was an utterly bad thing in my book.Unfortunately I still have Volume 2 to watch. Maybe it will be better?I think I would rather put Pulp Fiction in the DVD player.	2.0	Highly overated and too over the top...	2007-12-31	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1R2URG8OHNEDS	"Ed Mich ""Ed"""	"I was captivated by ""Kill Bill Volume One,"" from the first black and white frames, to the last scene in the hospital. It was two hours of blood, gore, comedy, drama, and action. Two hours of pure fun. When this movie was over the only thing that I could think of was waiting for Volume Two to come out. ""Kill Bill"" should have been a complete epic with the two volumes put together instead of seprate.The film is told in segments or ""Chapters."" The chapter that struck me a great phrase was the chapter entitled ""The Blood Splattered Bride."" I have no clue why that name was just so perfect. I think it was because that it sums up the basic plot of the movie in only four words. Uma Thurman plays The Blood Splattered Bride, or as she is known in the movie as Black Mamba. Whenever her brith name is spoken, instead of it being said, a loud beeping noise blocks it. The first time I heard that I was confused, thinking there was a sound problem in the movie theatre. Then when it happened a couple more times I relized that it was the work of writer and director Quentin Tarintino.The movie begins with Black Mamba in her wedding dress, lying on the floor, blood covering her, breathing very hard, and the handkerchief of a man washing some of the blood off of her face. We are introduced to this man as Bill and then after wiping her face, he shots her right in the head. Brief graphic, more amazement. The amazement is how cruel some people could be. The next scene is a couple of years later, and Black Mamba pulls up in front of the house. She enters the house of Vernita Green and we learn more. Black Mamba's story is that she was part of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. She became pregnant with Bill's child, and then she decides to quit the group and go out and get married. On her wedding day, her friends betray her and show up at the wedding, not to give their respects, but to hurt her and kill the other nine guests at the wedding. Her ""friends"" are Vernita Green, Elle Driver, Sidewinder and O-Ren Ishii. Played by Vivica A Fox, Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen and Lucy Lui, in the order. I won't tell you what happened in Vernita Green's house, but when she leaves we flashback to when Black Mamba awakes from the coma that the bullet caused. Four years lost and her baby is gone, Black Mamba decides to get her revenge on every person that caused her death. First she buys a sword from the Japenese man Hattori Honzo and then goes off to kill the first person on her list. O-Ren. But with O-Ren's large group of protectors, her assistant Sophie Fatale, and her seventeen year old deadly bodyguard Go Go Yubari, Black Mamba knows the first battle will be extremly bloody, and extremly hard.One of my favorite parts of ""Kill Bill Volume One"" was the animation scene when we learn about the origin of O-Ren. It's about fifteen minutes long, also bloody, but I liked it because the movie had everything. It has ninja style action, comedy, drama, regular action, and a great plot, and then it adds another thing. The anime sequence. I was shocked when that part came because it was the least thing that I was expecting.The entire movie was bloody. Blood in the beginning, through the middle, and then a massacre at the end. The only part that had no blood was when she went to see the swordsmen. But even during that scene you are expecting for her to just take out a weapon and kill somebody. The scene that was probally the sickest violence in the movie is when one character bites another characters tougue out of his mouth. My tougue was actually hurting as I watched it.""Kill Bill Volume One"" is Oscar material. I only wish that instead of making it into two parts, they just made it all into one long epic movie. It would be more fair to the Oscars instead of almost the same movie being nominated twice. For The Lord of the Rings it's different because nobody is going to sit in the movie theatre for six and a half hours. But ""Kill Bill"" is probally only about 3 hours and a half in full. People could sit through that entire thing without having to pay admission twice. The thing I wonder about most is when the DVD comes out will it be one long movie, or will it be seprated into two different DVD's?ENJOY!Rated R for strong bloody violence, language and some sexual content."	5.0	Perfect!

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AT6CZDCP4TRGA	Eduarrdo Nietzsche	"I wasn't real impressed with ""Jackie Brown"" so I approached this film thinking that Tarantion might well have already peaked with ""Pulp Fiction""---boy was I wrong!  Just as Sergio Leone took westerns to a whole new and higher level, so Tarantino does to chop-socky martial arts flicks, plus a huge dose of 'TUDE.The fight scenes are fast, furious and in your face; the dialogue is vintage Tarantino uber-cool; there's tons of self-parody and black absurdist humor throughout; the pacing is mostly seamless and quick; the camera work is flawless; the soundtrack as typical for a QT movie just rocks.  Sure there's lots of blood and guts but it's all very aesthetically well done, you really don't feel grossed out so much as fascinated and giddy.  The violence is cartoonish, and since Uma is the protagonist there isn't the usual obnoxious testosterone swagger we so often get in these action films.Through it all Tarantino applies a beautifully subversive twist to the martial arts action genre: here, the women (especially one Uma Thurman) are not only foxy but fierce and fearless while the men are mostly just pussycats at their mercy.Made me want to go see Volume 2 pronto!

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2TVG3BFW8Y1B1	Eeesh	I just wrote a review but after reading some more of everyone else's comments I feel I need to tack on a footnote. Quentin Tarantino is not trying to teach everyone a moral lesson.  All these people giving Kill Bill one star are just missing the point.  So many other movies conform to these ridiculous moral standards that are ultimately meaningless anyway.  Would I be a better person if at the end of Kill Bill Uma Thurman's character realizes that violence is wrong?  Of course not!  For Tarantino, cinema provides the opportunity for us to live out these outlandish fantasies that we could never confront in real life.  Everything about this movie is hard-core, because Tarantino refuses to compromise anything, and that's why it is so good.  For proof of how ignorant people are who don't like this movie, just read some of their reviews carefully.  One is signed by a husband and wife, but it is clearly only the husband speaking, as he speaks in the singular.  Another rambles incoherently using as many obscure words as possible, while another desperately tries to sound like an intellectual, using pretentious words like &quot;whilst&quot;.  Come on, watch this movie with an open mind, violence is a part of our culture already, so just accept it and enjoy.	5.0	One More Thing	2004-05-24	3	1	2

But when I finally released that yes, it WAS Kill Bill Volume 1, I loved the whole thing. And is it just me, or is the warning of requirements for strong stomachs just added to praise the excellent Quentin Tarantino? There's no denying it is gory, and graphic, especially when the Bride cuts a woman's arm off with a samurai sword, but I never felt the urge to leave the room and go throw up. Anyone under 12 probably will though, so don't let kids watch it.

This is definitely a film that should be seen BIG.With it's cartoonish blood, fight scenes, revenge filled plot, and awesome soundtrack, ""Kill Bill"" delivers a true homage to a variety of movie genres.Starring Uma Thurman as our vengeful Bride, who was left for dead on her wedding day, who kicks butt clear across the entire movie.  It is really quite a spectacle to see.One thing I couldn't quite get over was that the actor playing ""BUck"", who seems to always play a jerk of all trades, played the boyfriend in ""Valley Girl"".

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AYPRXU1X7J05P	"""eikiel"""	I guess, from reading through several pages of user reviews, that this is one of those films you either adore or hate. I'm not too comfortable myself with this whole releasing of 'special editions' and 'ultimate 2-disc editions' we've been getting these days from various houses and this is probably no exception. However, this annoying trend doesn't diminish the movie in the least. If you're buying DVDs for extras, then perhaps you ought to be waiting for the 'bloody amazing mega-turbo ultimate gold 14-disc edition' that will undoubtedly come out in a couple months time along with Kill Bill vol.2.The movie itself, though, like I said, is love it or hate it. There's a copious amount of blood and gore, which is treated pretty much like any other design element. The entire movie moves from everyday color, to gritty black and white, to gorgeously garish Tokyo neons at night (oohh, that yellow and black moto outfit)... Everything about the movie screams lush and vivid and lovely. It's not a movie that really takes itself too seriously, it just wants to take you along for the ride. And it -is- an amazing ride.Also, hello lovely soundtrack. I haven't seen a better collection of pieces in ages. The music itself makes this a must-own movie.

It was recommended to me by my sister, who loved Natural Born Killers and since I do recall liking that movie (however stoned I was whenever I watched it) I decided to give Kill Bill a chance.  I'm so glad I did!The story line is kind of over the top, as are the fight scenes, but it's still such an excellent movie.  Not very much is explained in Volume 1, but I actually liked it a little better than Volume 2.  The reason being that my favorite part has to be when The Bride goes to Japan and takes out the Crazy 88 and O-Ren Ishii.  From the moment she yells ""O-Ren Ishii you and I have unfinished business"" till O-Ren realizes ""That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword"" I was completely glued to the movie.  For some reason the serenity of that winter scene of lightly falling snow in the Japanese garden has left an imprint in my mind.  I can't get it out of my head!When Volume 1 ended, and I waited for Volume 2 to start, I was saying how much I liked this movie so far and someone else asked why I liked it so much and all I could say was ""I don't know, it's just really good.""

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3JFM1JCYXW772	"Elena Case ""myyogini"""	Kill Bill Vol. 1 is one of the most creative films on the market today.  Quentin Tarantino masterfully weaves together several vignettes on the journey of X (I will not say her name, since it is part of the storytelling process to make her name have more value by awaiting the moment it is revealed in Vol 2).  The story unfolds in flashbacks rather than in chronological order, creating more interest, suspense and mystery about how the female warrior winds up on her path of revenge.  Lucy Liu is magnificently feminine, powerful, courteous and vicious, and her scenes are an incredible dynamic between the image of a fragile beautiful woman in Japanese robes and a well-trained killer who is respected and feared.  Tarantino uses a wonderful juxtaposition of happy little musical tunes over scenese of conflict, and he utilizes a variety of film techniques, including animation, as the story unfolds.  If you have issues with violence, do not see this film.  It is, however, wonderfully creative and the female warrior comes into her own power, has a cause, and her steel will and determination allow her to overcome the limitations of her body to undertake her journey.  I don't agree with her methods, but I love her power, her strength, her courage and the beauty that emerges.	5.0	Incredibly Creative	2005-02-25	1	0	1

So perhaps he refuses to do commentary on just his own films.On the film, the soundtrack is superb, in fact I believe the soundtrack is better than the film, and it is a spectacular film, and from anyone but him it would be outstanding. But you shouldn't expect PULP FICTION and it isn't. Brash and bloody and even arrogant at times with the editing style (the b/w and color transition timed with Uma's blink for instance) it is worthy of repeat viewings but not in the same leafue as RD or JB.The DVD is boring and uneventful, rent this one until the SE comes out.

I am sure it is boat loads of fun working with Quentin. There obviously is a reason movies like this are made. Five stars indeed. I'd rather watch reruns of Ghandi and a marathon on AMC of awful Clint Eastwood films like Unforgiven, then to ever, EVER sit through a Quentin film again.If this is the kind of raw new talent coming from Hollywood in that era, I certainly have a chance to bring my ideas to fruition.	1.0	brutal, brutally inadequate contemptible work of garbage	2010-05-25	16	2	14

I haven't seen a movie in a while that has made me want to watch it over again. The movie kicks ass, seriously! I loved the action sequences. It was like watching an anime/cartoon/comic come into life. The only warning I can give is that this movie is not for those easily offended by violence and blood. If you fall in this category, and if you're looking for a movie that sheds meaning on your life, you'll hate the movie. It's basically one big action movie and the plot is simple. I'm not much of a person who usually enjoys violence and gore, so I didn't watch the movie thinking I would enjoy it that much. In fact, I just accompanied a friend to see it. But all the ""violence"" is presented in the movie in such a way that it's funny. All these arms being sliced off and fake blood squirting all over the place. It's so farfetched, that it makes you laugh. It's a dark comedy, I guess you can say. To enjoy the movie, you shouldn't take it so seriously.I looved the ending of Volume 1.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2BFK44U088I24	"""elledeegee"""	I found this movie highly predictable and way more violent than any of the other movies. .The only really good moments are when they're playing a good piece of obscure music... ie, the intro song &quot;Bang Bang&quot; sung by Nancy Sinatra.My favorite moment was when the flute music plays at the end. (not a spoiler) I kept thinking what Japanese song this was and then I had the strange idea it could be Zamfir, but thought if it was it would be kind of a geeky joke between Tarentino and the few people who actually remember those tv ads for the panflute recordings... And by jove... the song is called &quot;the Lost shepherd&quot; performed by Zamfir. ;)If nothing else, I'll get a nice soundtrack of music from this movie. That's a guarantee with Tarentino movies. :D~L~ who's giving her copy of Kill Bill to her brother	2.0	Trite Bloodbath	2004-04-19	3	1	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A25KZY4JQWABMN	El Satanico	The recent release of Kill Bill on dvd is obviously a stop-gap release, and the extras on offer here show this.But i wont comment to much on this matter too much because Kill Bill is the coolest film ever made. Ever.People who dont like Kill Bill to me are dead inside, this is quite simply amazing. The visuals on offer in this film are some of the most mesmerising I've ever seen. And as far as Im concerned this is Quentin Tarantino's best film.Many people, I like to call them idiots, said that this film was a backward step for Tarantino. These people wanted another Pulp Fiction basically despite the fact that if Tarantino was to do another film exactly like Pulp Fiction it would be the biggest backward step he could ever take. And so he ventured forth and took on the massive chore of creating a martial arts cinema masterpiece, and succeeded.True this is the first part of a two part film but anything this amazing deserves to stand on its own and thus I think that it should be judged as a seperate film and given its rightful place among the all time greatest films ever made.So in short if you like Kill Bill I like you and want to be your freind, and if you dont like it I hate you and wish you would open your mind. Because if you open your mind I might like you eventually.	5.0	5 star film, crap dvd.	2004-04-20	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A230JUQIZ2YSOY	"El Smoksta ""smokay"""	I was impressed at the same time I was let down.  Is that possible?  The style was totally Tarantino, but there was just something missing here, and I'm not quite sure what it was.  Something tells me it's the witty dialogue most have come to expect from Tarantino.  The story was there, unlike what some critics have said, and it's an interesting one.  I just don't get why it's split up into two parts..cause by the time the movie ended, I was ready to sit and watch another hour and a half.  What's the deal man?  Money most likely.  Some of the violence was realistic, while some was worthy of a TROMA studio's look.  NO FOOLIN'!  With a huge budget, I'm sure he could've made it look more realistic, but perhaps that was the point.  This is NOT a black comedy, though there were some scenes that did make me chuckle.  This is a straight up serious, for the most part, revenge story, and I have a feeling a BIG SHOE is going to drop with part two.  The only thing I can say to summarize KILL BILL VOLUME 1 is that it's a Hollywood blockbuster (yes, I used the H word) with a B-movie feel.  But congrats to Tarantino for keeping the grit!

Pulp Fiction? Whatever. Kill Bill has amazing fighting scenes too cool to describe. So many memorable scenes and lines. Uma Thurman was also absolutely wonderful here along with the other wicked bad guys (or should I say girls). The Japanese release of the DVD is also better - it has more scenes, etc. and will be releasing in theatres in North America soon (according to Tarantino).

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ARPI7ILEOQ848	"EnglishTeacher ""scubabear"""	The dialogue was written by committee.  Dialogue seems to be stupidly stiff like nobility, and the very next line from the same character will be slangy and rude.The action is beyond unbelievable.  For example, we're asked to believe that there's a direct flight from America to Okinawa (the southern boonies of Japan), and that Uma Thurman is able to smuggle a samurai sword through airplane security, then steal a motorbike (and matching leather clothes).And the photography.... Ohhhh, pleeeease.  I was praying for some airbrushing, or at least not so much close-up, when the camera was thrust close in on Uma Thurman's toes.  No offense, Uma, but nobody's toes are pretty in closeup, nobody's skin is pretty in closeup, and &quot;uma&quot; is the Japanese word for &quot;horse&quot;.  Arrrrgh.From Quentin Tarrantino, I expect clever dialogue and well-drawn characters.  Instead, I got cheesy violent effects and a script that your preteen brother could write better.And, for pete's sake-- if you're gonna claim that Lucy Liu is raised in Japan and heading the Japanese mafia, then TEACH HER TO SPEAK JAPANESE WELL.  By thunder, aren't there any decent dialogue coaches on Tarrantino's staff ?This film is supposed to be a tribute to comic-books and the 1960s/70s mafia movies of Japan.  Instead, it's a cheesy insult to them...and us.If you want perfect Tarrantino, see &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; or &quot;From Dusk Til Dawn #1&quot;.	1.0	Utter crap, and SO un-tarrantino-like.	2004-05-27	28	11	17

For the record this is one of the most ultra violent, bloody,and revengeful movies that I have ever seen.  It is Samurai Jack meets Charles Angel and Blade. The blood makes Jason, Halloween, Jeepers Creepers, and Aliens look tame by comparison. This movie is a super ultra-bloody, and violent. This is no way a compliment.

This movie, only Tarintino's  4th, has been a true movie picture. It is a great story with lots of action and martial arts. Uma Thurman, who stars as the bride, does a spectacular job filling out her role in getting revenge. Uma has not been recognized too much except for her role in Pulp Fiction and some other movies but this one will change that. Again this is the best movie I have ever seen.	5.0	One of the best directed movies staring lovely Uma Thurman	2004-01-30	1	0	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1PO10X369JT93	Eric	"I tried to like the movie. I really did.I watched it with a very close friend who appreciates it very much, and I wanted to share in that appreciation. But the film just doesn't do it for me. It's hollow and pointless, postmodern when postmodernism has just gone out of fashion.Kill Bill, vol. 1 is a deviant gore-fest of 60s-era martial arts melee. Briefly, a plot synopsis. The pregnant Bride (known to the viewer by the codename Black Mamba), professional assassin of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS, for short), is shot down by her former compatriots during her wedding ceremony. All participants are murdered; yet somehow Black Mamba herself survives in comatose form. Waking up four years after the murder spree, she begins to recollect who she is and what has happened to her. Thus remembering, she decides to go on a murderous rampage, intent on slaying (in the most gruesome possible fashion) every member of DiVAS, including Bill, who is apparently the leader of the gang.First things first. Kill Bill is--literally--nothing more than Charlie's Angels in reverse. A secret gang of female special operatives, headed by an unseen male. The only difference is the sadism prevalent in DiVAS, whereas Charlie's Angels is harmless.This is admittedly my introduction to Tarantino's work; yet if this is his ""best"" he has to offer, I cringe at the possibility of watching his ""lesser"" films. Granted, Mr. Tarantino intended the movie to be as over the top on the gruesomely sadistic scale as it is; granted, he intended to essentially plagiarize an entire generation of action flicks. I understand all that. What I don't understand, is why. Some critics have tried to save the film by calling it ""artistic"".There are, in fact, some scenes which shine out. The anime sequence is a bold move, and some occasional cinematographic trick of the lens adds a nice touch to a scene, but none of that is in any way original. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a black and white sequence with only the eyes colored in. Or how many times a movie shifts from black and white in the beginning scene to color later. That's right, the same essential device is used twice in the same film. That's not only unoriginal, it's almost insulting.Artistic movies have a message--there is no message or moral to Kill Bill. It's just a sequence of bloody pictures one after another. There is almost no struggle. The only decent part, which I found actually interesting, is the reaction of the Japanese swordmaster's request by Black Mamba to craft a new sword, ten years after he vowed to never again do so. The swordmaster is the only real character--everyone else is a garish, one dimensional image. Unfortunately for the viewer, the swordmaster is gone after only ten minutes.It's an intentionally unrealistic movie with virtually no plot to begin with and therefore by necessity lacking in any plot development until the very end (when Tarantino uses a faded director's trick: introducing a totally unreasonable factoid to create a cliff-hanger in the very final scene), without any reason to be. I wouldn't risk the waste of money."	2.0	Postmodern, five years too late	2004-07-07	15	11	4

Is that such a bad thing? Meh, if he can make a good movie thats fun to watch, I don't really care.There is no substance to this movie, even for the stands of 'pop artwork'. To put it plainly, the action scenes are just plain boring. I'm a fan of action ranging from realistic to ""violence for the sake of violence"", but I was yawning throw the entire movie. If you want hardcore ultra silly vilence, there are much better things out there. It seems like this movie is popular amungst those who like to brag about how they ""love bloody and gory movies"". Sure, I went through my junior high phase of bragging about watching stuff like faces of death and co., but I think its time to grow up. The funny thing is, I was expecting it to be much more violent then it turned out to be.I guess I'm grasping at something good to say about this one, but having a tough time comming up with anything. I pretty much look at it as a bunch of flashing nothing to enthrall a stupified gawking auidence. Perhaps that was the point. I guess there were a few pretty scenes.I thought vol.2 was a very good film, however."	2.0	Simply put, a boring movie.	2005-12-05	8	2	6
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1PEKEZTSDJAVH	Eric San Juan	"If there is any word to describe my reaction to Kill Bill Vol. 1, it is this: Underwhelmed.Oh, there was plenty to like. Superb cinematography, really nice character and set design, and some very stylish sequences ...... but ultimately I was left shrugging my shoulders and saying, ""yeah, it was alright."" Following this film, I won't make any great effort to see Vol. 2, though I'll watch it if it comes my way.There was a lot of style and gloss and swagger, which is fine, but it was empty style and gloss and swagger. I didn't much care about the story or characters, I didn't find the humor funny, and I never felt drawn into the story or interested to see what happens next. About 45 minutes in I just wanted to see the bloodbath at the end everybody was talking about and be done with it.(Take note, I am not a fan of many of the genres Tarantino was referencing in Kill Bill, so things that would make a fan of Sunday Matinee Kung Fu smile would not do much for me).Still, there were some camera shots that were just fantastic - the car and motorcycles racing through Japan, the long single-shot sequence, the pan over the slaughtered wedding party, among others - and the score and soundtrack was flawless in every way, probably the best yet in a Tarantino film. The action sequences were well choreographed, and the special effects were delightfully campish.Yet in the end I felt a bit empty. Unlike my first viewings of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, when I knew I had just watched something special, Kill Bill Vol. 1 struck me as just ... good. And the hype claims much more than ""good.""Certainly an argument can be made that Vol. I was just the first half of the film, and hence is incomplete. The second half may well put the first in perspective. But this review focuses solely on Vol. I as a standalone film, and as a standalone film, it did not work for me.The film's merits aside, the quality of the DVD was outstanding, with a crisp picture and excellent sound. Techphiles will not be disappointed with the presentation in any way. The extras are sparse, but what is here is solid enough to tide Kill Bill fans over until the Special Edition is released.If you already know you like this movie, purchasing this is a no-brainer - great DVD presentation, good picture, and, well, it's Kill Bill. If you're unsure if you will like this, a rental is recommended before plunking down the cash on a purchase, because for this viewer, the reality did not live up to the hype."	3.0	Does not live up to the hype	2004-04-30	2	2	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	I can't really adore this film. I really can't. A lot of people love this film (my friends and my older brother really enjoy it), but I don't see this as a great film. I mean, it's great that other people like it; I respect other people's opinions. But for me, this film is not special to me in many ways. First of all, Tarantino's over-the-top style really turns me off. I do like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, but Kill Bill Vol. 1 is something that I dislike because of its awkward cinematography, and because of its annoying and unnecessary music. I don't mind style-over-substance, but this is really pushing it beyond the boundaries. Every scene just has to be overly stylish: 70's and 80's pop music is used, the photography is overstuffed with Avant-garde material, some scenes aren't even relevant to the story at all, and the overall tone of the film is all over the place. I mean, is this supposed to be a thiller, a satire, a black comedy? Since this is directed by Tarantino, who knows?I will say this, however. The performances, dialogue, and fight scenes are really superb. Tarantino knows how to create clever dialogue, and it shows not only in Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs, but in here as well. Thurman, Liu, Carradine (R.I.P.), and Fox really deliver with their impressive acting. The fight scenes, while overdone and overly awkward at times, are still a sight to see. And of course, the violence is perfect, and it should surely piss off every PC freak on the planet if they ever see this film (and I'm sure they already have). But on the downside, I don't think the good things about the film are enough to save Kill Bill from the bad things about it. The excessive style really turns me off from the film, and I can't really enjoy this movie after repeated viewings. It's good that other people like it, though.Grade: C-	3.0	The Trouble with Bill	2010-03-22	4	0	4

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AUEUJPCTTPUS0	Erik	Kill Bill Volume 1 is one of my favorite movies ever.  This is one of Quentin Tarantino's greatest achievments along with Pulp Fiction. As always Uma Thurman's superb talent makes this movie a real thriller. The movie is basically about a bride, which we do not know the name of, who is shot in the head on her weading day by her assasin boss, Bill. Sometimes, though, the violence is overwhelming. Me being a teenage viewer (14 yrs. old) thought that not many other kids younger than me should see this movie. The violence can be mentally upsetting. If you are 14 or older I say you should see this astonishing film. If you are intrested in martial arts, samurais, and old westerns, you need to see this movie.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1PQLR0EN31PE8	E. Smith	Yuen Wo Ping should get half the directing credit for this movie because half the film is his remarkable choreographed fight scenes. This is a stylish, slick, wonderfully artistically violent film. Uma Thurman is not only amazing but believable. Tarantino is very much aware of the importance of music and just like in his previous films I think he did in outstanding job in choosing each musical number for each scene.Basic synopsis: Uma Thurman wants revenge on a former employer and her former coworkers who shot her up during at her wedding. She spends the rest of that movie planning and exacting that revenge.As I said before, there are some amazing fight scenes in this film, in particular with a young 17 year old, but deadly Japanese school girl with a ball and chain. This is Tarantino's homage to the violent Asian action films of the 70s. Pretty much everyone knows that Quentin is a big movie buff and freak and his whole career in film making has been paying homage to the films he loved while growing up. This guy sees the beauty of the uberviolent, smashed nose, low budget films such as Cleopatra Jones, Game of Death, Fist of Fury, The Killing Machine (Japanese its - Shinkansen daibakuha). In fact if you ever get to see The Killing Machine you will understand much about the violence in Kill Bill. Anyway, the fight scenes in this film are nothing short from brilliant. My biggest detraction of this movie is that the way it ends. It felt, very much so, that it ended in the middle. I know Volume 2 will be released in February and I understand some aspect of splitting this film in half, but that is the problem. Most films that have sequels attached to them are films that have a definite ending themselves. But they were made with and ending. Volume 1 of Kill Bill was original made to be a single picture and thus the ending for the movie is actually in Volume 2. What we have here is a film that ends on its crest. We only get half the plot, we only get half the character development (what little Tarantino usually have in his films). What we get is half a movie. I am sure that Tarantino has a final cut clause in his contract and thus ended up with a 4, probably 4  hour film. And I am sure he as willing to release it as such, but Miramax came up with the (not so) brilliant idea of releasing the film in 2 parts. I guess in a hope of doubling its profits. I know theater chains hate 3 + hours films. They would rather have 8 showings of a 2 hour film instead of 5 showings of films such as Braveheart or Gladiator. They make more money during the day by faster turnover rates. So they WILL NOT support a 4 hour film. 3  hours is as a far as they are willing to go, heck they barely support 3 hour films. Now when a director wants to tell a story and it takes 4 hours to tell the only way we get the whole story is through director's cut DVDs (for example The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, 1st two parts added an additional 30 minutes each, it was the same way with Cameron's Aliens). There is only one POSTIVE light in this whole 2 part nonsense and that is that part 2 is being released in February and not a year later (as in Lord of the Rings). Will they release the film on one single DVD? I doubt it, where is the profit in that? Anyway, I give KILL BILL an A. I liked it and Quentin Tarantino along with fight choreographers Yuen Wo Ping and Sonny Chiba not only delivers a highly entertaining film but a highly memorable one to boot.	4.0	Kill Bill Thrills	2003-10-11	0	0	0

The plot is simplistic as follows: A woman gets beaten severely by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS), and is then shot in the head by the head of the squad, Bill. She awakes four years later from a coma and discovers she has lost her unborn baby. She seeks revenge for the people who beat her and killed her unborn child. I can't tell you much more, but I have to say this film has to be one of my favorite flicks of all time now. Quentin Tarantino has done it again I believe, and he has done it very well.	5.0	'Kill Bill' tops the list for best flick of the year!	2003-10-16	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	APEHF1SXY7HMF	"""exarphion"""	I loved Kill Bill Volume 1. Sure, it's a gory movie, with lots of violence. But hte gore is very cartoony, as is the violence. Also, the storyline is very interesting, and the fights are excellently choreographed. This movie is only for the action fans though, as the gore can be a turn off. However, it was an excellent film as far as Tarantino films go. Starring Uma Thurman, Lucy Lui, Vivica Fox, Daryl Hannah, David Caradine, and Michael Madsen.	5.0	Fun, Exciting, Cartoonish	2004-06-02	3	3	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3JD8FDS3CO3GH	FairiesWearBoots8272	"How can half of a movie be supremely satisfying as a viewing experience? That's just one of the remarkable accomplishments of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Volume 1, a masterpiece of cinematic style. Volume 1 is merely half of a story, which has Uma Thurman chasing down the bad guys (and girls) who left her for dead, yet it was certainly the single most enjoyable, satisfying movie that I saw in 2003.It's been over a decade since Tarantino blew us all away with Pulp Fiction, and in the time since we have probably forgotten just what a remarkable talent he is. In all that time we only had one film, 1997's Jackie Brown, an underrated gem that didn't cause a tenth of the stir that Pulp Fiction did. It failed to connect with a wide audience the way its predecessor did, probably due to the fact that it completely defied most expectations. To me, however, it was further proof that Tarantino was one of our best filmmakers. Now, Tarantino returns with two films that tell one story. Kill Bill, Volume 1 is the first part of the story featuring The Bride (Uma Thurman) tracking down and killing the criminals that left her (and her unborn child) for dead in a wedding chapel. That's the premise, but there is so much going on in this film, that descriptions just don't do it justice. Kill Bill was conceived as an homage to all of the flicks that Tarantino grew up watching: kung-fu films, samurai films, spaghetti westerns, crime dramas, action films, gangster films, Japanese anime, etc. He has taken all of those styles and created a big, delicious cinematic blend of styles and genres. This is quite simply a spectacular movie in every respect. Kill Bill is pure cinema, from the first frame to the last. Every shot is so infused with a love for the art of filmmaking that it can't help but rub off on the viewer. Every aspect of the film, cinematography, acting, editing, dialog, music, set design, is used flawlessly to its absolute potential. Every scene effectively conveys a different mood and brings to mind a different film genre, from Thurman's suburban fight with Vivica Fox to the awesome spectacle of the showdown in the House of Blue Leaves. Kill Bill demonstrates just what a filmmaker can do with inspiration and true passion for his material. It is a beautiful, beautiful film. As one critic eloquently stated, ""It's the most gorgeous B-movie ever made."" It also demonstrates how much can be achieved without computer animation. There might be some computer-generated or assisted imagery in Kill Bill, but it is absolutely minimal. Tarantino did everything retro style, including the amazing fight scenes. It's all just stuntmen on wires, no computers. He collaborated with Yeun Wo-Ping, the world-renowned choreographer who did the fight scenes in The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The fight scenes are indeed spectacular. Tarantino reveals himself as a skilled action director. However, the film is not all action. It is heavy on back-story and characterization.The film is accompanied by an amazing soundtrack, one of my all-time favorites. Starting with Nancy Sinatra's ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"", then launching into a wide variety of musical types. There are themes from the likes of Bernard Herrmann and Luis Bacalov, a Japanese ballad from Meiko Kaji, a rockabilly Charlie Feathers tune, Santa Esmeralda's disco-flamenco-rock cover of ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"" and perhaps the piece that's used to the most stunning effect in the movie: Zamfir's The Lonely Shepherd"". This one piece of music perfectly captures the feel of the film.If you are like me and passionately love Quentin Tarantino, and movies and cinematic technique in general, this movie was made for you. It is a truly remarkable film that cinema lovers should treasure. Plus, it's a whole lot of fun too. Very few movies that are this well-crafted are this much fun to watch. Kill Bill (volumes 1 and 2) is a film for the ages, destined for immortality."	5.0	Tarantino, Uma, and a big samurai sword... what more do you need?	2004-04-05	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM	Farffleblex Plaffington	"Before you jump to any conclusions after reading the title of my review, let me clear a couple things up.  One, I usually love Tarantino--his directing, writing, the films he's produced, etc.--and two, the reason I didn't like Kill Bill Volume 1 had nothing to do with not liking the fight scenes or violence/gore.  I love that stuff and that's the only part of the film that I found even mildly entertaining.Instead, the problem with Kill Bill Volume 1 is that it is extremely boring, almost completely lacks suspense, has awful pacing, and makes a number of self-indulgent stylistic missteps.I say ""almost completely lacks suspense"" only because of the first, relatively short section, where Uma Thurman's character, a former ""hitperson"", fights with another of the same kind, played by Vivica A. Fox.  Suspense arises here because we don't know who the characters are yet, we don't know anything about the plot, we don't know what their motives are, etc.  There is a sense of venturing into the unknown, where anything could happen.However, after this, Tarantino chooses to cling too tightly to his beloved device of non-sequential story construction, and the bulk of the film concerns Uma Thurman's attempt to take down a character whom we already know she has killed.  That saps all of the tension from the rest of the film and makes it plod along as a fulfillment of something we're already aware of.  It has all the drama of listening to your spouse tell _that_ story for the fiftieth time, this instantiation being filled with enough detail to take up an hour or two, and you're trying to read a book while they're telling it.Yes, Tarantino references tens of other films and genres in a ""homage"" that geeky fanboys can have a party game with--the one who names the most receives a free graphic novel and a case of Hawaiian Punch.  Who cares?  That in itself doesn't make Kill Bill a good story any more than a pointless clipfest of those films would make a good story.  There is a reason that DVD's consisting only of promotional trailers aren't usually bestsellers.Yes, there are some interesting shots and intriguingly blocked scenes in Kill Bill.  However, there aren't enough of them to make the film succeed if looked at merely as a series of images rather than a story.And yes, as I mentioned, I thought the over-the-top violence/gore was entertaining.  If looked at isolated from its context, Quentin almost outdoes Sam Raimi ala Evil Dead here.  However, and this is a big however due to having to consider context, Raimi's gallons of blood worked much better-because they were in an engaging, suspenseful story.  In Kill Bill, the violence was almost boring.In an effort to be ""retro hip"", Tarantino includes a number of elements that blend with the film as seamlessly as President Bush in an Iraqi mosque.  These are ubiquitous and varied, ranging from the stilted dialogue in the kitchen scene near the beginning (and this coming from someone who usually writes brilliant dialogue), to the strained inclusion of Sonny Chiba, to the ridiculous presence of a female Japanese band who can't sing or play their instruments--even though they're only trying to play I-IV-V ""rockabilly"" (and by the way, if this is what Tarantino think counts as quality music, what was he doing as a judge on American Idol?), to the almost obligatory occurrence of an anime scene.  The latter is there just because Quentin and the fanboys think it's cool.  For me, however, it underscores both the problem with most anime and with Kill Bill--yes, the subject matter, the violence, the attitude, etc. are interesting, but the animation, the storytelling, the pacing, and just about everything else sucks, and there are a number of inexplicable stylistic choices (such as the Caucasian-looking, big-eyed characters in anime).  ""Forced"" is probably the best way to describe the plethora of references and stylistic decisions in Kill Bill.  Even the foot fetish stuff didn't work for me this time around, and I share the fetish with Tarantino.I'm not usually one to recommend tempering self-indulgence, and I suppose it doesn't matter anyway, since at this point people are going to love Tarantino films just because they're Tarantino, although if this film were made by anyone else, it would have earned the reputation of the 1998 Jeremiah Chechik-directed The Avengers instead.  But if this is a sign of the quality to come, if Quentin is going to make further films that amount to laundry lists of all the stuff he likes _just because he likes it_, like a mega-budget mix-tape for a new girlfriend, I'm not watching any longer."	2.0	Tarantino's Worst Film To Date	2004-05-18	12	9	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A392AOA6ZHAK6R	filmflavor	"I am not a huge Quentin Tarantino fan even though I do like ""Pulp Fiction"".  So, I was surprised that I loved this movie so much.  In my opinion, it is better than ""Kill Bill:  Vol. 2"" (the 2nd half of this two-part movie).  Kill Bill is ultra violent and is NOT for everybody and I strongly caution anybody that is easily upset or offended by violence to stay away from this movie.  The violence is actually so over the top that it's funny and is meant to be funny (dark comedy).  But if you have a wicked sense of humor and violence doesn't bother you that much, (especially if it's used in a humorous manner), than this is the movie for you.  There are so many quotable and memorable lines in this movie and here are a few of my favorites:Memorable Quotes from Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)The Bride : ""Those of you lucky enough to have your lives, take them with you. However, leave the limbs you've lost. They belong to me now.""The Bride : ""It was not my intention to do this in front of you. For that I'm sorry. But you can take my word for it, your mother had it comin'. When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I'll be waiting.""O-Ren Ishii : ""You didn't think it was gonna be that easy, did you?""The Bride : ""You know, for a second there, yeah, I kinda did.""O-Ren Ishii : ""Silly rabbit.""The Bride : ""Trix are for...""O-Ren Ishii : ""...kids.""O-Ren Ishii : ""Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with Samurai swords.""Budd : ""That woman deserves her revenge and we deserve to die.""The Bride : [spanking a young member of the Crazy 88s with her sword] ""This is what you get for (...) around with the Yakuzas.  Go Home To Your Mother!!!""The Bride : ""But I am gonna ask you questions. And every time you don't give me answers, I'm gonna cut something off. And I promise you, they will be things you will miss.""Here is a summary of what this movie is about:In this film, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, an assassin called ""The Bride"" (Uma Thurman) is shot at her wedding by her employer, ""Bill"" (David Carradine), and other members of their assassin circle.  She survives, though a bullet in her brain keeps her in a coma for five years.  Setting out for some payback, the Bride hunts down the various assassins, saving Bill for last. This is the first half of a two-part movie.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AYWAY5MKLAITN	Film Noir Fedora	"Kill Bill was originally going to be one big movie. But then, naturally, Quentin Tarantino, world famous for his style, director decided to split it up into two volumes.From the get go, we are introduced to battered bride. She is scared and shivering until the man she was aquainted with, takes out a gun and finishes her off. But, on a poetic irony note, she looks him in the eye and says, just as he's pulling the trigger, ""Bill, It's your baby.""Bang!Afterwards, after a long spell of a coma in the hospital, we are thrusted into the life of The Bride . . . and her speeding train of revenge.The pure driven storyline, old-fashioned dialogue, huge sets, and creative period piece gives way to something that quentin Tarantino likes doing best - paying tribute to the genre of kung fu seventies movies. But, it is not totally ripping from the era. Qeuntin's style is thrown all over the place. It is said that Uma Thurman AND Quentin Tarantino came up with the plot and character of the bride themselves.The stunt work and fight scenes are exquisite and they will have you hungry for more. When The Bride is battling the Crazy 88's, a group of O-REN Ishi, one of the people who took part in the supposed killing of the bride, there is a heavy degree of hate and skill combined to make the perfect battle sequence. Uma Really Handles that Samurai Sword well.Not only is this a live action film but there are also certin style types to telling stories from the past.O-ren's past- done in complete Anime.There are also spagetti western characters.Some of the battle scene with the crazy 88's is done in black and white. Some speculate that the mpaa took a hand in that but I think it gave it a classic look.There is even a point where Uma is Breakdance fighting.For the women: If you are intrested in a grown women being a hardcore killer that is skilled with knifes, guns, kung fu, samurai swords, and such then this movie is for you. You'll thrill at the chance of seeing Uma fight and will also prove that women really can be deadly sometimes.For The Men: If you are looking for classic cinema coupled with a revenge story with many fights scenes and a lot of action than this movie is for you.True, there is some gore here and there but it's done in the same way that the kung fu movies were done in, and believe me, sometimes those movies can get pretty graphic.But, as always, Quentin never sacrifices his style, script, or direction becuase it's the thing that we are constantly craving. We just can't get enough of it. It's Just that Simple, folks.Final Verdict: A revenge Cut 'em Up rampage that doesn't hold back and still has time to look cool doing it."	5.0	"""I put a Bullet in her head but her heart just kept on beatin'."""	2006-03-14	5	4	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A8QFCFTZ9HXLB	FIREBALL XL-2	"Quentin Tarantino is a strange boy. He has never made a straight ahead film, and maybe never will. I'm not saying he should, but his movies are always more than you'd expect, and things aren't fully explained for a long time. There's always some twisted plots to figure out, or numbers of flashbacks.Giving style to movies is what Tarantino does best. His work reminds me of someone who is in the music business: someone who's a novice musician and writer, but incredible at producing the style that would make a stunning album.Kill Bill is a 'hip' tale about revenge, as the members of ""The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad"" (wow, I'll try to avoid any encounters with groups that have that kind of name) are about to regret the attempt they made on the life of a reformed member. She is known throughout the film as 'The Bride' (Uma Thurman). An opening close up scene has her face all bloodied up, while approaching footsteps make their way to her. It's Bill, leader of the gang, and as he sarcastically asks her some questions, she tries to answer, but he interrupts her with a gunshot to the head. Unseen here, but explained later in the film, is that 'The Bride', pregnant and engaged, was about to rehearse her wedding with her fiance and friends. Her former team mates show up at her wedding well armed, and slaughter everyone in the church. The wedding was the start of her life as a new person, and Bill, her former lover and boss, made a jealous move.Four years later, she is surprisingly alive, but in a coma in some hospital. Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) is one of the members of the 'Deadly Viper Assassination Squad' (I just had to say that striking name again), and decides to pay The Bride a visit with some lethal poison to finish her off, only to be stopped by Bill via cell phone. He suggests that they will get her another day, in an honorable fashion. This kill would have been like a cheap shot. Elle gets all sucky and mad, but even she has some honour. Otherwise, she'd press 'end call' on Bill, and finish the job.When Thurman is alone again, she snaps out of the coma, and after bowling over a pair of coma victim seeking perverts, wheelchairs herself to the parking garage, finds a crudely named getaway vehicle, and does some self help physiotherapy on her immobile limbs.Quentin Tarantino gives you a variety of styles that make this a treat to watch: occasional black and white shots (and the right shots too), anime' (a very violent short story about O-Ren Ishii's tragic childhood that brought her to where her way of life is now), and music that's the epitome of cool (I love the 5,6,7,8's ""Woo Hoo""). Vivica A. Fox, my favourite 'Viper', plays the second on the Bride's death list, Vernita Green (or Copperhead) and their fight was the most brutal of all the fights from the whole story, although this big scene comes to us first. See, the director once again doesn't just go from one to the next. It's back and forth: here, and then back up to there. O-Ren and The Bride's showdown is seen last in Vol. 1, but their fight actually was the first. That's Tarantino's style.Aside from plots of revenge and violence, it's also very funny. There's bickering between two men who run an old tea/sushi bar, and one of them is secretly a sword maker, who reluctantly comes out of retirement to create his finest sword yet for our heroine. Also, one balding server at O-Ren's favourite hangout is referred to as 'Charlie Brown' by her henchmen, and the overly serious O-Ren, who's now a crime lord, actually laughs at that reference. There's plenty of camp, and each slice of it is placed right where it should be, from cliche's, to references of other films, etc. There are some really corny scenes that pay homage to all those cheesy low-budget action movies Tarantino loves, like the jet plane that The Bride takes to Japan. It's clearly a model plane, and it flies/bobs like a toy prop you would see in a old low budget action flick. It gives you some laughs and relief from the tense yet sly pacing. Tarantino moves the movie around like a black cat, sneaking around for that big rat it's looking for. The 'big' pounce is coming, but there's a few other rats it needs to take care of first. Where does the film go as far as story? Well, the story isn't really much. It's more about the intentions and actions of revenge. This film is plenty entertaining, funny, and styled to the max, that the B-movie story (well, B+) is acceptable.Mark my words: this film is filled with plenty of blood and chopped limbs, especially when Thurman, alone, goes head to head with the ""Crazy 88"", O-Ren's army of watered down ninja's, as well as the much better skilled young Gogo Yubari, who is a sadistic teen girl that likes to kill (remember, don't let teens or kids see this flick-it's really a bad example). You'll probably laugh at the cartoonish lopping of some heads and arms, but after a good twenty dead or maimed bodies, it becomes really ridiculous and turns into a bloodbath.Uma Thurman, who's sincere in the role of this vengeful woman, was meant to play this role (it was written for her specifically), and goes well beyond some very impressive skills with a sword and martial art moves. The Bride wants blood, and although she gets some, her character is wise enough not to run into situations with her sword flailing and shouting ""hiiiii-yaaaaa!"". Her character's control is a relief. The Bride is smart, cunning, skilled, patient, and focused, even though her anger is hot. She also has a pain that grows deep inside of her. Her loss is great, and this volume is not enough for her. Hence Volume 2.We all have to try and remember: Vol 1 and 2 are not separate movies, but merely one film cut in two parts so we could wait in anticipation for the other volume, and for Tarantino to make some double moola. Smart marketing. I didn't mind paying twice, and I didn't mind waiting. Both volumes were really worth it."	4.0	"""Here Comes The Bride....."""	2006-01-03	7	5	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ACFIJ7MBN8964	"Fire Dog ""BurningChris"""	"What happened to the good old days when movies had a beginning and an end and that was it? People moved on, did other projects, and tried to expand thier boundries with new ideas. Today it seems that it's all about the sequel. Don't get me wrong, I agree that Lord Of The Rings must be shown in three seperate parts, but Bill too? Oh well, such is money making - oops, I mean movie making. On to the review.This movie was.... odd... but in a good way. Never has there been a movie shown in black and white, color, and anime all in one. The violence was over dramaticised, but it was obviously done on purpose. Odd touch, Quint. The Bushido and martial arts remained plausable unlike Pooping Tiger, Squating Dragon - which is a good thing. I prefer Jackie Chan style plausability in my martial arts. High wire special effects stuff tells me that either the actors were not physically able to perform the stunt (IE. too many twinkies), or we're going ""comic book"" where action is concerned. Either way, not entertaining.The actors did a good job in thier respective roles, and casting was pretty damn good where that goes. Lucy Liu is beautiful, and did a great job. Uma, kudos for your physical work. Julie Dryfus (who's she (?), and Damn, she's hot), Vivica Fox, Michael Madsen, David Carradine, all great picks. But as for Darryl Hannah? Not sure what happened there. She's just not bad guy material. Entertaining movie, but wouldn't own it.PS. To the whiners that said there was too much violence, you're whiners! ""Kung Foo"" movies are violent, go read heart warming stories that you can find in your bible - oh wait, there are none.

And everyone awaited so long for his next big movie.And that's it.Kill Bill has a simple but yet complicated, at the same time, scenario.It's about a woman, with the code name &quot;Black Mamba&quot; (Uma Thurman) who used to be an assasin, and a high-class member of an organized assasins' team (whose leader was Bill), but decided to leave them , so that she could get married and lead a normal life. Of course, that was out of the question for Bill, who sent her former colleagues and friends, in her wedding, to destroy her marriage and kill her. She is pregnant at the time of her marriage to Bill's child.After the assasination of the whole church, she manages to survive out of plain luck. She remains in coma for a long longtime and then... she wakes up, ready to take revenge for her colleagues almost-lethal &quot;visit&quot; in her marriage, that costed her her child. So she practices just so that she can destroy them and of course... KILL BILL.Kill Bill is not an ordinary movie (after all, Quentin's movies are all about surprises!). It's a mixture of Japanese kung-fu movies (that Tarantino adores) with the American adventure movie style.It's story is more or less, a liberating action : REVENGE!!The direction is awsome.you won't get bored watching the movie ,no matter what.

Presented in the FULL HD 1080p (1920x1080 lines) 5.1 Dolby Cinema Sound format (5 speaker plus Subwoofer) we can now completely enjoy Quentin Tarantino genius in this complex action packed well executed, perfectly cast, Directed, and written critically acclaimed film.Uma Thurman is ""The Bride"", the Ultimate Revenging Samurai Warrior. She is perfectly cast, period.This Blu-ray presentation is total eye candy and the musical Sound Track is the perfect accompaniment to the action. A must see!!!!I've had this Blu-ray movie for 1 week and I have watched it 3 times.  The replay value is endless.  Tarantino has created the perfect masterpiece.  (and this is only Volume 1)Bonus Material: Only 480p (w/HDMI) but the 22 min Making of KILL BILL doc is worth the viewing and the 6 min music video of the Singing Group 5,6,7, 8's is cute.  Finally Tarantino film trailers.Bottomline:  Remember the Blu-ray experience is HDMI (1080p) 5.1 Sound in a HD Home Theater (the bigger the screen the better).  Enjoy.  This is a keeper with many encore performances to be had.P.S. - Volume 1 ends setting us up perfectly for Volume 2 (I can't wait!!!)"	5.0	Finally KILL BILL in Blu-ray w/HDMI & 5.1 for the HD Home Theater does this movie justice !!

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A23OMH2BWS95ZE	"Francisco Cortes ""Fcortes"""	The movie is great! everybody knows that! but to be a Quentin Tarantino movie it have a lot of stereotypes againts the asians.Quentin says that Hollywood movies are the ones that increase the sterotype againts the minoryties, and now he made a movie that is even worst than Hollywood. I know that he wanted to do a tribute to the martial art films, but I mean.... Not every asian people knows about swords, anime, samurais, revenge and killing people with martial arts, for example: The fist time that O-Ren (Lucy) appeared, she was quickly introduced by anime sequenses of Yakuzas killing her family, then she grewn up to be an assasin after avenging her family.. When Uma Thurman arrived in Japan, the only person that didn't know about martial arts and killig people was a lady that sells tickets in the airport.. In Japan, all the people were born with fake blood that comes out like a shower if you get cut and all the americans were born with normal blood.. If you saw Kill Bill 2 you realize that anything that is not asian is normal.There are many more things but I think that I finished for now. Like I said before &quot;the movies is great&quot; because is packed with action, swordfigthing, good story, so-so acting, great music and interesting characters. I could say that is one of the coolest movies ever since Natural Born Killers and Pulp Fiction. The movie is &quot;whorth buy&quot; but I think that Quentin could do a great tribute movie without so many stereotype, so let's hope that he doens't make the same mistake again.Thank you for lisening! goodbye and take care.	3.0	COOL MOVIE!!!

Most of the film is in Tokyo ( Actually in night club in Tokyo)were Uma Turma kills about ninety Yakuza with a Katana . Unfortunately the coreography is chinese not japanese. So some of the movements are absurd. What I mean is that it is diffilcult to fight 90 Yakuza. With the tipe of fencing show it is impossible.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3BA5ISHG5AHF2	Frank Gregg	The last months in the movie industry has been nothing but remakes, sequils, and live-action versions of comic books.  I was actually going to see a different movie when I saw this, but this was the only thing playing.  I watched it and was amazed.  Q.T. has done it again, and this is by FAR my favorite of his movies.  It was absolutely amazing.  Though there is an extremely enormous amount of violence in the film, it is presented in a way that it doesnt even seem like overkill or even very gratuitious.  The story line is completely original, the casting was excellent, and the filming could be described as nothing more than fabulous!

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2BHDXL4Y31HZA	Frank Rodriguez	"With that quote of revenge followed by ""an old Klingon proverb"" in the movie you know fully what your going to get from Quentin Tarantino's new flick.Take a dash of exploitation,a liberal dose of comedy,add in some of the best choerographed kung-fu, marinade with gallons and gallons of blood & violence and simmer. End result? KILL BILL. I loved this movie like no other this year. Is this movie for everyone? Heck,no.This is the  kind of movie that falls into the love it or hate it category. But it really should be viewed by everyone who just loves movies in general.KillBill just oozes cool like no other.From the soundtrack to the Shaw Brothers camera shots that snap full zoom on Uma's steely-eyed look of retribution to the anime flashback segment that doesn't break the continuity of the film.You just can't deny the artistry that went into making the visual splendor of Quentin's take on the often-overlooked grindhouse & kung-fu movies of the 60's and 70's.Much has been said about the violence in the movie and yes there is plenty of it. But it's all done with a wink & a smile. It's the epitomy of cartoon violence. For most seosoned movie-goers it's not shockworthy.This aint ""Ichi the Killer"" type of violence on display but what's there is satisfactory because of how damn cool it all is.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ATJE929ETFFNH	"Fred ""Fred"""	Tarantino's gift for &quot;easy&quot; moviemaking is unsurpassed.  He doesn't burden the viewer with extraneous matter and the result is a free flowing, singsong of a movie.  There are indeed some parts of Kill Bill 1 that will cause moments of discomfort to the more sensitive viewer, but those shouldn't detract from the enjoyment of the story.  Taranatino's fusing of anime and live action, while not strictly new or even experimentation, works and that's what matters, taking viewers to places not usually visited.  Good movie and highly recommended.	5.0	Superlative moviemaking	2004-04-19	3	2	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2Z1K2I2EYSKFA	FrontPage	"I wanted to lead my review by warning readers to be wary of reviewers who write too much, which may spoil the outcome and some of the surprises that unfold in this yarn of revenge.Now, for the movie: It's important to mention that those who are sensitive to violent portrayals, loud noises and screams may consider not watching this film, the most bloody and violent in the history of filmmaking. Be sensitive to those who are curious to watch Kill Bill with you by knowing what their limits may be: within the first 5 minutes, I leaned to my companion asking her to tell me the moment she felt uncomfortable, while the woman next to me scolded her husband for not warning her of the graphic violence.The moment the film opens, following an unusual tribute to ShawScope films (note about this below), the violence is already in progress, and only lets up to allow us to breathe, process the shocking information, and dive right back in for more. Director Quentin Tarantino's style weaves stories back and forth, giving viewers bits and teases (along with some rather shocking gore) but unless you've had it and are insistent on storming out of the movie, I urge you to watch it all the way to the credits. Tarantino is playing with our minds like a psychiatrist. Even those of you who don't like violence, you may find yourself justifying the revenge set out by Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) and searching for when the second Kill Bill movie will be released, which I'm sure will have continued spins, surprises and detours from predictability to keep you on your toes.This is a jawdropper, clearly outpacing previous shockers like Taxi Driver, Terminator, Natural Born Killers and Reservoir Dogs (all of which generated a backwash of criticism). Strangely, I haven't heard any uproar criticizing the violence and high body count which are usually follows such a movie release.Tarantino began Kill Bill with homage to Shawscope by showing the Shaw Brothers' logo at the very beginning, before Uma Thurman stole the show. Shaw Brothers films, which are Hong Kong movies of old school Kung Fu presented to English audiences complete with wild Chinese boxing and hideous dubbing, is a film format that is usually authentic letterboxed, which Kill Bill appears. But Kill Bill is actually filmed in ""Super 35,"" a hybrid film format that fulfills the letterboxing for big screen presentation while allowing the film to be presented on traditional NTSC (television) aspect without needing to crop the important content. The film process uses a camera with horizontal matting so the director can frame the shot for the film audience. Whenever the movie is presented on full frame TV, the viewer actually will see more content, since the matting is removed to allow the film to be presented on traditional TVs."	5.0	Watch for Reviewers' Spoilers	2003-11-01	4	2	2

Tarantino brings everything that Asian cinema has to offer in this film. The classics such as gallons of blood and just flat out martial arts action. You get the best of it all in this film. Nothing like a revenge story to really get the story going. What was so interesting about this film was the many ways the story is told. One minute being live-action and at one point being Anime.The actors and actresses for this film were the perfect choices for who they played. I'm a David Caradine fan from the Kung Fu days and he is still a very impressive actor. To Sonny Chiba in this film was also the right decision to make. In my opinion, probably the best martial-arts movie star besides Bruce Lee, a true legend in my eyes.The storyline is fun, although unrealistic in this day and age. You know she would be in jail for killing all of those people, not to mention she leaves good evidence that she is the one who did all the killings. But who cares? That's what the story is all about, she is wanting everyone to know who is responible. It's her revenge! If you love martial arts movies, especially those classics from the 70's, you have found heaven in this movie!	5.0	Tarantino's Tribute To 1970's Kung-Fu Films And I Love It!	2006-05-17	5	5	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AEJ0EGQ79Y0KK	Gareth Mc Bride	"Revenge has long been the inspiration behind many films and novels. A classic example is found in the pages of Moby Dick where Captain Ahab peruses the white whale in a reckless and deadly obsession fueled by his desire for revenge at all costs.In the films ""Jaws"" and ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" both had strong themes of revenge central to their plot. For example, Khan desired revenge against Captain Kirk to the extent that he was willing to risk his life, freedom, and the lives of his crew to obtain it.  In ""Jaws"" Quint places his crew, ship, and life in peril rather than allow his pride to be wounded and admit that he needs help in bringing in the shark.In Quentin Tarantino's new film ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"", audiences are introduced to Black Mamba (Uma Thurman), a former assassin who is attacked and left for dead by her fellow employees on her wedding day.  She awakens from a coma four years later with a steel plate in her head and a score to settle.After escaping from the hospital undetected, Black Mamba sets off for Okinawa to mentor under a sword maker and prepare her body to take revenge. With the aid of a specially made sword, Mamba sets out to locate and kill her former cohorts especially her boss Bill (David Carridine) who put a bullet in her head on her wedding day.Tarantino tells the story in a stylistic and at times bizarre manner that uses foreshadowing, flashbacks, black and white scenes, and anime in a non-linear story that jumps around nearly as much as the aforementioned Black Mamba during a fight scene.  Thurman does solid work in a very demanding and physical role, yet does not get much sympathy from the audience as many have a hard time feeling tremendous sympathy for a person who is a stone cold killer.  Lucy Liu provides a fine supporting performance as the head of a crime syndicate named O-Ren Ishi who is sought by Mamba, as she was present at the wedding day massacre.There has been much mentioned in the media of this film being divided into two pictures rather than releasing a three-hour picture. In many ways, this is a disservice to viewers as after a fantastic action sequence, the film ends in under whelming fashion with only a slight bombshell of information being announced.  While this does add a degree of interest, it does not provide the big hook that may be needed to make casual viewers want to pay to see the completion of the film rather than wait for the video.That being said, Tarantino has provided viewers a film that is a dazzling combination of action and visuals that will delight some and frustrate others who are looking for more depth.  The film shows that Tarantino is a talented and visionary filmmaker who is the master of mixing action, quirky characters, over the top action, and twisted humor to create a symphony of theatrical originality.3 stars out of 5Gareth Von Kallenbach"	3.0	A dazzling mix of action and loopholes.	2003-10-09	4	4	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV	"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"""	"Tarantino makes movies about other movies: his films lift everything from characters to plot devices to camera angles, glosses up the costumes and attitudes, laces them with adolescent humor, and then swirls all the bits and pieces together in a tub of blood.  The results have been extremely inconsistent but never less than interesting in at least an academic, art house sort of way.KILL BILL, VOLUME 1 is essentially a teenage boy's blood and sex fantasy run amuck.  The story is so classically revenge it might have--and maybe was--inspired by Elizabethan drama.  A woman who has been a member of an international squad of hired assasins becomes pregnant and decides to marry and retire; at her wedding reception, however, her handler and co-killers crash the event and kill every one.  Well, almost every one: she survives.  Four years later she awakens from a coma, is mightily ticked about the whole thing, and decides to kill everyone who was involved in the attack.As in PULP FICTION, Tarantino borrows a great deal from a host of film masters, perhaps most notably from Hitchcock, Kubric, Altman, Stone, and Lynch: narrative camera angles that rise to provide a bird's eye view of the actors as they move through the sets, disjointed time, overlapping plots, and a heavily stylized visual sense.  He also borrows a great deal from 1960s and 1970s ""trash cinema,"" most particularly Kung Fu foolishness and deliberately sparse spaghetti Westerns.  In terms of story and overall execution, however, this is essentially the stuff of a pimple-ridden teenage boy's blood and sex fantasies: sexy women fighting, shooting, and slashing the hell out of each other.In this instance Tarantino gets away with it because he seldom gives you very much time to think about any of it--and on the rare occasions when he does, he goes out of his way to point out his various juxtapositions with a gleefull ""I Meant To Do That!"" finger.  And there is a lot about the film that is quite funny in the same pitch black, subversive way that PULP FICTION was funny.  Two women square off in a snow-drenched Japanese garden to Spanish music and so on, the sort of small inter-cultural cinematic jibe that Tarantino does so well when he puts his mind to it.  It's actually very entertaining.But there is a problem here, and it is the same problem that has plagued every one of Tarantino's films.  Yes, the film is deliberately trendy in a truly relentless way and often very funny as a result; yes, the fight choreography is visually stunning; yes, the deliberate clash of music and visuals and cultures is often very witty.  But in the end it is all a surface cleverness with nothing underneath, and the film is really Tarantino's ode to how hip and cool he wants us to think he is.  We never see him on the screen, but we're constantly aware of him standing off to one side screaming ""LOOK AT ME!""  You might describe the whole thing as an entertaining study in the director's overcompensation for not actually being the ""super-cool"" guy of his own cinematic fantasies.Note to Mr. Tarantino: as a friend of mine is fond of saying, ""cool"" can't be acquired, it simply is, and you either have it or you don't.  I've never met you, but I'm pretty sure that you aren't a quarter as ""cool"" as you tell people you are, and I'm also pretty certain that you know it yourself.  Now, you actually seem to be a talented guy; why don't you stop this foolishness and actually do your own movie instead of tap-dancing through all the stuff, good and bad, you saw when you were fifteen?That said, I actually rather liked the film.  (A lot of people won't.  It is very bloody and the humor involved is dark.)  It's worth a look, and if you don't expect anything except pure surface you may well enjoy it.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A11242S1AGQT0I	"G. Devai ""makeithapn"""	First off, let me say that like most people, I enjoyed Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.  In fact, I watched them several times without getting tired of them.  I even watched Jackie Brown a couple of times.  But I'm having a tough time getting through even my first viewing of Kill Bill.  I have been watching it today 10-15 minutes at a time b/c it's just too damn BORING.This movie is basically an extended music video, interrupted by bouts of violence and the kind of dialog you would expect a 16-year-old to come up with.  Anybody who's calling this movie &quot;artistic&quot; is seriously lacking in IQ.  Tarentino basically took a random sampling of popular culture and made it into a &quot;video&quot;-- I wouldn't even call this a movie.All the Asian characters are caricatures of tired stereotypes.  In fact, ALL the characters look and act like they belong in some lame-ass comic book your kid brother just drew up.  To boot, not only does this movie lack a message, damn-near half of it is pure filler.  By filler I mean half the time you're just looking at people sitting or walking or driving with music in the background.  None of these montages advance the plot, so the only purpose they serve is to make the movie long enough for cinematic release.The fact that most people are giving this 5 stars is a testament to the stupidity of the American public.

This movie is violent, it is bloody, it is gory.  There is also action, humor and my own personal favorite an Anti-hero and villans you love to hate.  In spite of everything that makes you want to scream ""WHAT THE HECK!!"" in the end somehow it all makes sense.  This one of those movies you have to go see a second like to fully understand it all.  In my case it made much more sense the second time through.The Acting was great David Kariden proves that he can make both an excellent villan and a great wandering Chinese holy man.  I also liked the character of Black Mommba and Cotton mouth.  This is not your typical action movie, it is more like live action Annime and it will inspire a lot of knock offs.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ANBQIWHO9JRFS	General Zombie	I'm gonna say up front that for the purposes of this review I'm interested in the movie itself rather than the actual DVD, though I will say that you probably ought to wait around for the set with Volume 2 as well, which should be coming out late this year.(No real specifics are available about it, that I'm aware of, though it is believed that it'll have the extended and colorized scenes from the Japanese cut, which the first DVD release doesn't have, on top of being a complete movie, rather than just half of one.)When I first went to see this film way back in October I was not particularly excited and a tad ambivalent.  I'd seen and loved Reservoir Dogs, but I hadn't seen Jackie Brown or Pulp Fiction, and I didn't really know much of anything about Kill Bill.  But my friends wanted to go and I'd heard some good reviews so I checked it out. I was, to put it lightly, highly impressed.  It is, as people often describe Tarantino's work, a movie about and based on other movies, rather than on reality.  But that's alright, cause I find movies to be much more entertaining than reality, and this is my favorite movie of 2003, bar none. (Which is particularly impressive, considering that it's only half a movie)One of the most common criticisms of this film is that it is too derivative. My response to this is twofold. 1. It's not really particularly derivative as far as genre film-making goes.  Action movies are the probably the most clich&eacute;d genre of film, with the possible exception of the horror movie. 2. I don't really care either way, as I'm not really looking for anything original when I see an action movie. I'm looking for nicely choreographed violence, and anyone looking for anything else shouldn't go see action movies. And that, obviously, goes for anyone considering seeing this, too. (That is, until it is released with Volume 2, which isn't action-oriented, and would completely change the dynamics of the film)All that said, this isn't as action-oriented as most reviewers make it out to be. It is, however, almost utterly visually and atmospherically oriented, which is sorta the same thing, or at least has much the same effect. Thus, character development is held to a minimum, and the dialogue is not up to Tarantino's standards, but the visuals never cease impress and the soundtrack is completely perfect.  It mixes things up well from a visual standpoint, moving from simple, unadorned hospitals to an anime style sequence to intentionally cheesy and phony miniature sets to some exquisite Japanese visuals, particularly the snowy garden at the end.(The eerie, red sunset alongside the plane is particularly noteworthy as well)  It combines the simple with the beautiful with the cheesy with the blood-splattered, and they all work.The film is divided into 5 chapters, which each play as a sort of vignette, (though they involve the same characters, obviously) which eventually comes together when you see it all.  The problem is, you don't see it all until you've seen Volume 2, which is compounded by the fact that this volume contains the scenes which are most tangential in the film. Thus, it is a movie of great scenes, not all of which may be terribly relevant to the rest of the story, but all of which entertain me, which is far more important, to me anyway.  And, although it doesn't necessarily come to much from a plot standpoint, it all fits together wonderfully stylistically and atmospherically.  Furthermore, all the extra scenes work to create a more complete universe, one which extends beyond the scope of the actual movie.  It's a difficult effect to describe, but I really like it.(It's another thing that you won't fully be able to appreciate until you see Volume 2)  But there's no getting around the fact that Volume 1 alone fails to create a complete, satisfying story.  This doesn't really bother me, but it is a valid criticism.In keeping with the surreal, alternate universe sorta feel of the movie the action is wildly stylized and extremely balletic. More significantly, it is simply stunning.  The main fight in the House of Blue Leaves is simply my favorite action scene in film.  It's beautifully paced and has a smooth, flowing beauty to the choreography which provides a powerful contrast to the absurdly exaggerated gore and carnage of the scene.  The final fight with O-Ren is quite excellent as well.  It's much slower and more deliberate, but has an undeniable intensity to it. (The music for that scene is absolutely perfect, and completely makes the scene.  It fits the mood exactly and is perfectly timed) The other fights are first rate as well.I've referred to how excellent I found the music of this film a number of times, but it requires further examination.  It is schizophrenic, perhaps even more so than the visuals, and manipulates the mood of the film in much the same way.  The cheesy yet effective Nancy Sinatra song from opening credits sets the tone nicely, and the Morricone-esque music from the anime sequence provides a great contrast to the Asian visual theme.(The brief piece that is played as they pan up the assassin's sword is particularly  powerful.)  But I'll cut off the specifics, and suffice to say that I could easily have listed half a dozen more scenes where I find the music to be particularly effective.  Some have complained that the soundtrack was overbearing, and I understand how someone could feel that way, but I personally loved.  It is a bit over the top, I guess, but over the top is what this film requires.Well I've rambled on long enough I suppose, though I don't think I've quite shown how much I love this movie.  Just go check it out if you haven't already, and then go catch the equally excellent second half before it leaves theaters.	5.0	Half of a Masterpiece	2004-05-11	22	17	5

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1FS9R0JXHLHEG	George Annessa	Sure it's outlandishly violent and bloody. Can anyone expect Tarantino's movie not to be a true mind-blowing, adrenaline-pumping shocker? Of course not! Gritty and slick, his first instalment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the '60s and '70s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humour with terror. It's impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.' iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the 'Carrie' blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride's gory face as she's introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death. Or is The Bride 'Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai' - as O-Ren Ishii blatantly puts it?This film's a sampling of the Tarantino 'fury' short of the Tarantino customary fiery tongue. It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It's almost as if I'm watching a colourful and bloodied kabuki stage that's displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samurai sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It's examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favourite 'old-school' filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there's a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events.Even at 'The House Of Blue Leaves', we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, 'Kill Bill and all of Bill's DVAS members.' My adrenaline's still flowing as I'm recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts.	5.0	Gratingly Bold And Captivating Martial Arts Extravaganza.	2004-06-29	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AITKXU3ZGAA0I	Georgios A. Katsaros	"This is by far one of the best movies you will ever see.Its cool,hip,fast,slow when it needs to.Its a movie with style.Writer-Director Quentin Tarantino just knows how to make great movies.The story is simple.Its a story of revenge.Th Bride is shot down on her wedding day by her former employer Bill and her old friends O-Ren,Vernita,Budd & Elle.She falls in coma.When she wakes up from her coma she goes on murderous rampage of revenge against them.This film of course is in Quentin Tarantinos style of non linear structure storyline.The casting is great.Even though we dont get to see Bill until Volume 2 it leaves you know a bit anxious to see him in the next one.David Carradine everyone will remember from Kung Fu.One of Tarantinos qualitys is casting people that have been having a bad run in films.In Pulp Fiction John Travolta,in Jackie Brown Pam Grier & Robert Forester and this one David Carradine.Uma Thurman as the Bride is perfect choice.I wont have never expected her do all the things she did in the film but was i surprised.And the Viper Assanation Squad greatly casted with Vivica A. Fox,Lucy Lui,Michael Madsen & Darry Hannah.The action is mesmorizing and incredible especially the scene of ""The House Of Blue Leaves"".The dialogue is not what you would expect from a Tarantino film but good inoff for this.Another thing that is Tarantino trademark of putting great music in his films the music helps move the film and get to feel the groove of the it.Also the acting is top notch.There is graphic violence in this film but not as much as people say i mean ive seen worse.Trust me this not the movie that will make you stop the film because you feel sick.This not Tarantino best film but it is his coolest to me.So stop whatever your doing my friend and go buy this film,you wont regret it.The film was originally going to be one film Kill Bill and not split into to two parts.But Quentin Tarantino was shooting some much footage that also so good.If i remember correctly it was one of the producers that mentioned the idea to split the films.It was not so much a bad idea.In my opinion both Volume 1 and 2 are perfect and diffrent in their own ways.This one more action and showing homages to Asian cinema that Quentin loves.Instead the second one is more dialogue and emotional driven.With more homages towards Spagetti Westerns.The DVD doesnt have practily any extras.One nice little behind the scenes.But its to short.At least its informative to its small length.The DVD includes trailers from his other films and of Kill Bill.But i have to tell you there have been rumors of a new special edition of the dvd coming in the near future so wait if you dont want to waste your money on buying it two times.Kill Bill Vol.1 is true film of filmakers love for the whole art of cinema.There is no other director that loves film like him.Quentin Tarantino tested himself to a new genre showing his talent being of the best directors of our generation."	5.0	Very Cool!!!	2005-09-26	1	1	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1FI1FWO1IQ6Y3	"G. H. Giroux ""Eccentric Writer & World Traveler"""	Being one of those people who up to this point has no clue as to why everyone considers Tarantino a filmatic genius, I didn't have much hope for KB1. I still don't get the Tarantino mystique (VERY weird guy by any stretch of the word, and he can't act), but I admit I liked this film and have watched it several times. Of course the action and 'blood' are overwrought, but that's the point. He had very effective use of color versus black-and-white, action versus slow-motion, but the anime about O-Ren's early life went on far too long. And - Vernita's daughter was far too old for the plot: given the timeline, she should have been no more than 3 years old, and that kid certainly wasn't. Nevertheless, I found myself anxiously awaiting the debut of KB2 on the movie channel; however, I was disappointed for the most part in that film as well, for different reasons: the slow pace, the extended alndscape and bar scenes, the failure to 'explain' things I wanted to know, like where did 'The Bride' come from, how did she get hooked up with Bill, why was she the enemy of the other DIVAs (besides her defection from the clan)? But - there was that delicious performance by Daryl Hannah, and the great fight scene between her and Uma Thurman - that pretty much made the movie! I hovered between 3 and 4 stars because of the inconsistences and gaps, but what tilted the stars to a 4 were Uma Thurman's chameleon, gutsy performance, and, of course, Elle Driver.	4.0	It Grows On You After Multiple Watchings	2005-02-20	3	0	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A34UFYMOMMRSMQ	godzilla twain	Quentin Tarantino's fourth film is his love letter to the 70's Kung Fu movies that he cherishes so much. The music, sound effects, camerawork, dialogue, and stunts are all directly from those cheesy flicks from way back when. But Tarantino doesn't stop at just borrowing from the Kung Fu genre. He also borrows from Samurai flicks, exploitation films, Yakuza movies, Westerns, and even anime. Because of that, Kill Bill ends up being a really weird movie. Your enjoyment of Kill Bill Vol. 1 will depend heavily on how much you appreciate a good homage to those films. Though I'm not a big fan of any of these kinds of movies, I still appreciated what Tarantino was doing and I enjoyed Kill Bill Vol. 1 quite a bit.Kill Bill's greatest strength and its greatest weakness is the action and violence. The film is filled with cool fight scenes. The best fight of the movie features Uma Thurman battling the Crazy 88's, a gang of sword wielding Japanese thugs. The fight choreography is amazing and the swordfights are some of the best ever seen on film. There's also a spectacular knife fight in a kitchen between Vivica A Fox and Thurman. It is tough, bloody, and brutal. It's awesome stuff. However, as anyone familiar with Tarantino knows, the fight scenes are underlined with tons of blood, shocking moments, and brutality rarely matched in today's cinema. In fact, Tarantino takes it to the far end of the spectrum to the point that it becomes parody. . There's so much blood that it becomes silly. (Believe it or not, this is what some of those old movies were like.) This violence may be a turn off to some people.The film also changes in look at a fast rate . The movie goes from color to black and white, from live action to cartoon, and from crystal clear to grainy. It's a bizarre mix, but it works in the film. Also aiding this movie is the awesome soundtrack. It's an eclectic mix of tunes featuring everyone from Nancy Sinatra to a Japanese surf band to Wu Tang Clan's Rza. I particularly liked the music from the trailer (also heard in the club scene) which I believe if from Rza as well.Kill Bill also has a wicked sense of humor. There are hilarious moments all through the film. It's this kind of one-two punch of horror and comedy that makes Kill Bill unique.Uma Thurman is incredible as The Bride. She's tough, intelligent, and someone you wouldn't want to cross. Her stunts and swordwork and very impressive as well. She really makes you believe she could do many of the stunts she performs. Vivica A. Fox also comes out of nowhere as Vernita Green and does impressive stuff. She switches from DiVA assassin to soccer mom with amazing ease. She, too, does some impressive fight work in her showstopping fight scene with Uma. Chiaki Kuriyama is also cool as Go Go Yubari.One of the other major handicaps of Kill Bill Vol. 1 is its length. It is cut abruptly short with a cliffhanger ending that leads you into Kill Bill Vol. 2. From a business standpoint, it's a good move. People who enjoyed the first will be back to buy tickets for the second. From a storytelling standpoint, I think the film could have been trimmed down and all been fit into one movie. It would have been a lot more satisfying story, I think.	4.0	Kill Bill features some dark comedy, amazing bloody fights,	2004-07-28	0	0	0

Uma plays a bad ass chick on a warpath of revenge against the ones who tried to kill her. The big fish is the notorious ""BILL"".... ohhhhh!!!!!The jokes in the movie are subtle and predictable, the story is simple, moronic and non moving. I give the actors credit for doing a great job. Uma was really great and perfectly casted as the lead. There is some parts of kill bill that are fun, but most of the time I felt like I was watching a violent video game. Limbs and heads fly like the game ""BloodRayne"".Personally I thought Kill Bill was worth the ticket I purchased because I was expecting a stupid and fun movie and I got that, but others who came to see a masterpiece were not happy. I'm very anticpated to see what others think about a 2 hour moronic movie that didn't end. Will people pay to see the last 2 moronic hours when the sequel is released or was this enough kill bill for 2003???My advice is to see the movie if your very bored, dont buy the DVD and deffinetly buy the video game(if they ever have one)!!!!"	3.0	Kill Bill, Volume 1	2003-10-12	6	2	4

And this movie is pretty much a staightforward sequence of well-directed and cleverly made action scenes with enough blood and violence to deserve cult status and some appeal. Mix some black humour, cultural and cinematic references, technical gimmicks, a cool soundtrack and even an anime sequence and you will have ""Kill Bill"". What seems to be lacking is a decent and original plot, since this is nothing more than a typical revenge story about a vitimized and angry tough woman. Overall, this is flashy and disposable entertainment that doesn`t care to provide much food for thought. Not that it is a bad thing, but Tarantino has done better and a movie like this doesn`t deserve all the praise it got.Disappointing."	2.0	It`s Tarantino So It`s Good, Right??	2004-03-30	19	4	15
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A16FUU8WW76QFY	gork57	'Kill Bill' is a difficult film to review.  It has many elements simply copied from other, older genres (martial arts films, westerns), has music from 60's/70's TV shows, and buckets of surrealistic blood (gushing like fountains from amputated limbs/heads).  Inject Tarentino's bizarre sense of humor, and you have one oddball of a movie!Tarentino's penchant for time frame manipulation (ala Pulp Fiction) can make things a little confusing for those not familiar with his approach, but it all comes together if one has patience.  His cinematography is simply superb, especially in the fight sequences, which are the real stars of the film.  The final battle in the Japanese bar is awesome, in spite of the extreme gore.  Tarentino has a way of making dismemberment a humorous event: witness the Lucy Liu 'Yakuza' meeting.I'm not sure I like Tarentino's flippancy toward bloodletting-it's all a sort of cartoon to him.  When one thinks about the real blood being shed in Iraq and Afghanistan (which the US government goes to great lengths to PREVENT the American public from seeing), this stuff feels awfully petty.  Nevertheless, Quentin makes it all seem like no big deal, and creates a near-poetic way to present it to us.  Think about it: if you saw this amount of human devastation on CNN, how would you react?

Pretty much devoid of gentler emotions (save that for volume 2, which is also excellent, but for different reasons), this movie is just a feast for the eyes!  Two hours of non-stop action and fun, what more do theater-goers or Hd-Tv owners need?  A thrilling soundtrack plays wonderfully against the blood, taunts, sweat, death, and...cheers?  From the audience, of course, who are sitting on the edge of their seats, staring with awe at the massacre going on in front of them, and finding it grossly amusing.  Indeed, the gory parts are so over-accentuated (that was Tarantino's intent), that they (partly) cease to be disgusting.  Instead, Tarantino focuses on making the movie as cool as it can be, directing a great cast who really knows what they're doing - entertaining!I REALLY enjoyed the dialogue.  Some of it was ridiculous, but fun nonetheless.  Verbal sparring (go Hattori Hanzo and his bald friend!!) and character interactions not in the form of violence were very appropriate in context, and shed light on the actual character of the characters, which was definitely useful.  Favorite character is The Bride of course, but I really found GoGo amusing.  Too bad they cut out the part with her sister trying to avenge her death (""Yuki's Revenge""), that would've been crazy fun.So, as you can see, I enjoyed this movie very much.  I can say the same for the excellent soundtrack (in the movie itself, because some great songs were left out on the CD).  If you're not grossed out easily, watch this incredible movie!

It seems that through each of his movies he keeps telling his audience:"" Look how smart and knowledgable I am. Aint I cool?"" Kill Bill is one gigantic exercise in this cinematic narcissism. QT takes a hacked-to-death B grade revenge plot(like I spit on your grave), puts in stock characters(the washed-out master, the over-the-top villians--one of them wears a Long John Silver type patch on her eye), makes them sprout cliched dialogue and puts them in standard ""hong kong-style"" setpieces. And despite all the seen-a-hundred-times garbage he pumps in, QT is able to lift ""Kill Bill I"" to the level of celluloid poetry. Purely on his own story-telling strengths and nothing else.So how really does he pull it off ? For a start, exquisite frame compositions and brilliant background music. He uses innovative narrative patterns like anime to advance the plot; he pays tribute to himself(who else!) by inverting events like in Pulp Fiction. The entire movie is punctuated by cool cinematic tricks..like using an overdose of gore to dilute its very impact. The violence is cartoonish and designed to revolt as well as entertain you in a way you didnt think possible.

The blood-spattering deluge of ultra-violence is equally shocking and compelling. It is, in some respects, like driving by a horrible car accident: you don't want to see what's going on, but you can't look away.  Walking out of the theater, my friends as well as others I overheard all said, ""Boy was that a violent film.""  I felt the same way as well.  For the first hour or so.Then, I began to have a quite different reaction to the film, one based upon Tarantino's dedication to his craft and the skill with which he created this remarkable film.  There is little doubt that Tarantino has brought to ""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" his genuine love of film, and of this genre of film in particular.  It seems as though every shot is beautifully composed. The gleam of a sword, the juxtaposition of two frames, the gracefulness of movement, and even the ultra-violence are amazingly captured by Tarantino's lens.Add to that, the wit and humor of this film and the compelling (though straightforward) plot all make this a truly remarkable film.If you are a fan of Tarantino, or are even just a fan of film, I'd strongly encourage you to see ""Kill Bill, Volume 1""."	5.0	Beyond the extreme violence, an excellent film	2003-10-14	1	0	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2UYAFQ40U2PHS	"Grigory's Girl ""GR"""	The whole Kill Bill is one of the dullest, most pointless exercises in celluloid that I have ever witnessed.  While Volume One is decent, it is hardly anything amazing. The 2 Kill Bill movies could have easily been edited down to a 2 1/2 hour running time, but Tarantino decided to make one of the grandest exercises in self indulgence I have ever seen.  Scenes from Volume Two should have been edited in as quick flashbacks in Volume One, but instead we got long, completely worthless expository scenes that served no real purporse other than Tarantino wanted to put them into his film because, he's Tarantino.  Even if Quentin had cut the film down to 2 1/2 hours, it would have been an average film at best.  It certainly would have been better than the 4 hours of indulgent swill we had to endure (I watched the entire 4 hours in one sitting...big mistake).  Critics gushed all over this film, claiming it was full of real emotion, and that Quentin had matured as a filmmaker. They couldn't be more wrong. This is a film by a man who knows about movies, but not about real life. Tarantino grew up watching crappy Kung Fu films, sleazy European trash films, and bad Jack Hill films. And the influence of them permeates his work. If you need to watch a 4 hour film, Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, or Once Upon a Time in America are available. One frame from any of these films is superior to Kill Bill....	1.0	Volume One slightly better than Volume Two, but still a grand exercise in futility and self indulgence...	2006-03-22	20	7	13

But I would never have thought to rip off that genre to the degree that Tarentino did in this movie. He even used the same music in spots! But if you are going to rip off a genre, this is a good one to pick.Fortunately, Tarentino manages to keep this film from turning into another &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; (a snoozefest to end all snoozefests) by adding alot of bloody shootouts, swordfights and knife fights that are well choreographed. Tarentino even managed to throw in some Anime segments as well. I was amazed that two of the biggest acting downers in history are in this movie (Uma &quot;Avengers&quot; Thurman and Lucy &quot;Any-Movie-That-She-Was-In&quot; Lui) but it was still entertaining! Go figure.Should you buy this? I don't know, I would rent it first if I was you.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A18MBO1U4DPY20	Harkanwar Anand	"Kill Bill is an epic of a film. It is one of a kind  and what I loved about this film is the mixed reviews I heard from people. You see most people have shorter attention span than others and cannot tolerate violence. I do not think this film was of very violent nature. However, I do feel it's immensely entertaining and wholesome in it's movie making experience.I never liked revenge films and it's a genre that became my favourite after I watched the epic film called ""Oldboy"" around August this year. Oldboy was fascinating with that slap of phenomenal flabbergasting suspense it has. Kill Bill is better directed than Oldboy but its just one step down from being the best revenge film I have ever seen. You see Oldboy wins over this film. However I take nothing away from this flawless flick.Most people think that fans like Kill Bill because of the violence it contains. I beg to differ because the story line and how it unfolds on screen is what I loved the most about this film.Uma Thurman plays a role of a lifetime. I still can't believe she can move like that. Around 90% of the action on this film would make Crouching Tiger look like a fairytale of sorts. I do not care if this film is exaggerated and stretched beyond what most imaginations can be led to believe. I usually lie on my couch while watching films but Kill Bill ensured that I sit up and take notice.It is quite difficult to talk about what I appreciate most about Kill Bill but it made me a Tarantino fan. I never liked any of his earlier films as much as I liked this one. I cannot wait to watch Kill Bill 2 and I am glad I own the dvd. I never bothered to watch it. I love how fresh Kill Bill was because the studios,the atmosphere around the film , the swords, the blood, the black and white scenes, the wagons,the airplane with a orange feel outside,etc. were all that made Kill Bill into a film that I would remember all my life.My Rating - 10/10I suggest all fans watch Oldboy too.Respect,HSA"	5.0	Whoooooooaaaaaaaaaaa!

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2HVL790PBWYTU	"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read"""	"It doesn't get more revengy than the roaring revenge flick KILL BILL Vol. 1. This is Quentin Tarantino gleefully indulging himself, and maybe there's a box of Kleenex within reach. KILL BILL Vol. 1 is a masterful stroke, a sort of a grimy, funny, inventive masterpiece. Tarantino lifts from the best elements of the 1970s grindhouse cinema, shapes KILL BILL into a distillation of childhood memories and base impressions culled from our watching countless 1970s Hong Kong flicks, samurai dramas, spaghetti westerns, and urban exploitation thrillers.So much is deliriously familiar here, echoes of my kidhood bouncing around inside my skull, from the opening trumpety blare heralding the Shaw Brothers logo to the wickedly inspired soundtrack to the Bride's yellow track suit to gushing arteries and cameos by martial arts icons Sonny Chiba and Gordon Liu. Pardon the alliteration, but the boldness and the bombast and the babe-on-babe bashing... and the brevity of the dialogue. Tarantino curbs his jonesing for rambling talkfests to demonstrate that he, too, could shoot a pure action picture. The dialogue, what there is of it, is gloriously stilted, quite appropriate to this epic, exaggerated vengeance yarn.Before Kobe Bryant hijacked it, Uma Thurman's character wore the ""Black Mamba"" moniker. But we refer to her as ""The Bride."" Four years after being with child and bloody bludgeoned and taking a bullet to the skull at her own wedding, the Bride erupts from her coma, thirsting for vengeance. We learn eventually that she once was a member of an international hit team called the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. And yet I was more impressed that it takes her a mere thirteen hours to overcome four years of muscular atrophy. She then makes a list composed of names of her betrayers, all associated with that same assassination squad. And even though ""O-Ren-Ishii"" is first on that list, the film opens with the Bride confronting ""Vernita Green,"" second on the list. Tarantino never did care for straight-up sequential storytelling.Perhaps I should place a mild SPOILERS alert here, even though this sucker's, what, eight years old? There may still be oblivious folks out there who haven't yet run across KILL BILL or moving pictures or the wheel.This is the kind of film that tends to trivialize its menfolk. Even though we get to see old hands like Sonny Chiba and Gordon Liu, they are more or less marginalized. Instead, Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, and Vivica A. Fox are showcased. As the deadly bladeswoman ""Vernita Green,"" who was once codenamed ""Copperhead,"" Fox brings a rough-and-tumble aggression to the screen. The Black Mamba and Copperhead engage in brutal, no-frills combat, made all the more gruesome and stunning in that it takes place in a suburban dream home. In the intervening four years, Copperhead had repented and changed her ways; she'd settled down with a loving family. The Bride doesn't give an ef. She crosses her name out.This seems a fine place to give a shout out to Tarantino and RZA (of the Wutang Clan)'s collaboration. You can't say enough about their marrying of imagery and soundtrack. It results in many spectacular moments.I'll say this about Sonny Chiba. Over the years he's only cemented that strong, steely presence. Verisimilitude is brought to bear, and there's a neat kick in that Chiba sort of reprises the roles he'd played in the Japanese TV series SHADOW WARRIORS. The Bride journeys to Okinawa, Japan to beg a sword from retired legendary swordsmaker Hattori Hanzo. It's one leg in the hero's journey. More importantly, it's Tarantino's fond curtain call for Sonny Chiba who has aged with grace.Another exhibition of verve and style - and, perhaps, to stave off censorship - is Tarantino's decision to reveal O-Ren-Ishii's origin in splashy, blood-soaked anime format. Else, the disturbing elements in that origin may have been, well, too disturbing. This sequence sets up Lucy Liu's character as one damaged but badarse villainess, never mind that she's a contemptible hybrid of Japanese-Chinese ancestry and so shouldn't even have had a whiff of taking over the Tokyo underworld. This is Lucy Liu garnering her best role ever. She makes O-Ren-Ishii a.k.a. ""Cottonmouth"" into a formidable adversary for the Bride. Doesn't hurt that she's got her homicidal and batsh-- crazy 17-year-old bodyguard, Go Go Yubari (the sensational Chiaki Kuriyama), and her numerous Yakuza henchmen, the sword-wielding Crazy 88, to back her play.Tarantino breaks down the film in titled chapters, of which the wild ""Showdown at House of Blue Leaves"" is perhaps the most unforgettable in a narrative braced with unforgettable moments and images. ""Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords."" And still O-Ren-Ishii mocks the Bride, even though the Bride, in full on Black Mamba mode, had just dispatched her Crazy 88 crew (including its general, Gordon Liu), as well as that deadly high-schooler with the chain and mace. There's a certain grace and elegance in the Bride and O-Ren-Ishii's duel, their tensed-up figures stark against the soft snow banks outside the House of Blue Leaves. And, afterwards, once the Bride has lopped off the most relevant bits of Cottonmouth's skull, she can't help but assume a place in the pantheon of kickasss women. And this, with her mission only two-fifths done.The DVD's bonus stuff:- ""The Making of KILL BILL Vol. 1"" - an interesting behind-the-scenes look which includes segments concerning Tarantino's collaboration with RZA and how Tarantino first learned of the Japanese girl band The 5,6,7,8's (00:22:04 minutes)- Bonus Musical Performances by The 5,6,7,8's: ""I Walk Like Jayne Mansfield"" & ""I'm Blue"" (00:05:51 minutes)- Quentin Tarantino Movie Trailers"	5.0	"""Yellow haired warrior... go."""	2012-05-12	0	0	0

This is a considerable understatement. Tarantino pulls it off with so much style that it makes you wonder if it is ridiculous, after all. He's found such a way of working with these cliches and scenes of mindless blodshed that it's an insult to use words like 'cliche' and 'mindless' anymore. Really, I don't even understand what he's done, I can only bow down in awe of it. This movie is the highest class of art. It's life-altering. Buy it.

I had low expectations.  Man! this movie blew me away!!!  I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the filthy language (that's a hurdle that's hard for me to get over).  But, aside from that, it was a great action-packed movie with excellent music and great acting.  Uma will never do better than she did in this movie.One may be tempted to think this movie a little cheesy, but that's if one tries too hard to fit this movie into the scope of reality.  It's not supposed to be realistic, it's supposed to be entertaining and humorous.  When the guy gets his head chopped off, don't analyze the way the blood squirts out and think it's unrealistic, just laugh at it!  You've got to have a good sense of humor while viewing this.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A457S8SW690NM	hi	This movie is fantastic! Uma Thurman, Vivica A Fox, Lucy Liu, and David Carradine all star in this strangely funny and awesome movie. The story is about revenge in which the bride (Uma Thurman) seeks revenge on Bill (David Carradine) and his gang after they killed her husband and left her for dead. She has her large sword and she's slicing nonstop. Tarantino also seems to add comedy to this, notably with the squirting of blood like a fountain. It may sound nasty but you have to see it to understand it. The martial art fights are awesome and shall be remembered forever. Believe me, after watching the movie in full, you'll rewatch the wicked figt scenes. I really don't know what to say to encourage you to watch this movie besides that it's just awesome! This unique movie is a lot better than the sequel but the sequel is also good.It's also very neat when they switch to an animated form to show Lucy Liu's character's past. Believe me, this movie is absolutely amazing!This flick has a great beat that you'll just have to get up and dance to. The movie is in plain words just tight. It's really funny (pu*&^ wagon!) and also has some of the coolest fight scenes. Funny enough, I loved this but hated Pulp Fiction. So go figure.	5.0	Tarantino's masterpiece	2005-06-21	2	0	2

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3AJZFUF87LI0Y	"Hillary ""jezebelxiii"""	To the reviewer who read the Tarantino script and was appalled at the violence, I ask you:  What did you expect?  It's Quentin-Freakin'-Tarantino.  DON'T READ IT AND THEN GET MAD WHEN HE FULFILLS YOUR EXPECTATIONS.That being said, Tarantino pulls all the same rabbits out of his hat as he has on other movies.  It's stylish, fast, and the  soundtrack is great in that quirky sort of way.  He tips his hat to the old kung fu-style movies, excessive gore factor included, and it works.  It's not supposed to glorify violence, it's supposed to mock it in excess.  And it does that beautifully.The casting is superb, the script writing clean, and certain scenes are just beautiful - the Japanese garden excursion and anime sequence come to mind.  This film is visually breathtaking, and where it's supposed to be, equally horrifying (the opening scene and hospital scene are perfect examples).So, my advice:  If you liked either From Dusk Til Dawn, Pulp Fiction, Desperado, or Resevoir Dogs, see this.  It pleases.  And if you haven't liked Tarantino's past stuff, DON'T SEE IT.  He doesn't do anything revolutionary to change his ways(why I gave it 4 and not 5 - he does really stick with his old formula), and you will still not be enamored.Happy viewing, y'all.  This is quite a ride.	4.0	Kill Bill - A Visual Maelstrom	2003-10-11	1	0	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	This statement lies at the ending of this movie. I must state that Tarantino has made the most original and honest tribute to the great oriental tradition ; specially to the immortal Bruce Lee , (Kato style from the green hornet TV series from the sixties)Quentin Tarantino made a brilliant film , inmersed in the middle soul of the revenge . In many ways when I watched the film I couldn't let to think about a modern adaptation of The Count Of MonteChrist to the modern times. The takes are elegant , and the camera handle is still better than Pulp Fiction .Thurman is magnificient in this role. Her charismatic beauty however, is not an obstacle for her to show all the spirit of fury , rage and cruelty that this character demands.The violence reachs poetic heights. Specially in the final duel.An ovewhelming triumph from Tarantino ; the edition and special effects are first rate. And from now, consider the decisive multiple sword duel in the hall as a true classic sequence. It's a macabre coreografic dance filled with histamina.Don't miss this tribute to all that generation of Kung Fu  fighters : Bruce Lee , David Carradine , Jim Kelly, John Saxon and Karate gladiators too as Chuck Norris.A superb picture.	5.0	The revenge is not always a straight line!	2004-06-11	1	1	0

Experience with his other films will work too because there are so many annotations from his previous work in this film that just noticing them would take several viewings of the film. Of course people wont go see this film for stuff like that but i find them interesting to see.There is plenty of gore, action and Uma to keep the teenagers interested but there is also some great dialogue that didnt get enough credit as it should have by film critics. This film was classified as great cinematography and like many Tarantino films as having an awesome soundtrack, which it does. I think that this film is a balanaced combination of all techniques assciated with classic Tarantino, including dialogue which many people thought was lacking too much in.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A27QZVCRIXVNBR	Horselover_Fat	It's really amazing how easy Tarantino makes film-making seem. He has such a mastery over his craft that the film moves with such smoothness and grace almost unseen since...well since Jackie Brown actually.But contrary to what most reviewers have said on here, Kill Bill is very very different from Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere is the same, but the dialogue isn't as quick-witted and the action is, for the most part, all shown - as opposed to Tarantino's previous three films where the violence was mostly implied.But that is the whole point of the movie, it follows the great tradition of kung fu, anime, and blaxploitation films, and that is exaggerated violence. It's also a kind of 'inside pop lesson' with references from Michael Jackson to Bruce Lee. The anime sequence in the movie is truely a beauty to behold, expertly done in all aspects. And a brilliant idea to have an anime sport a scene that otherwise would've very likely given the film an NC-17 rating (given the pedophile subject, etc.).Now to the great soundtrack, which Tarantino has always delivered in every one of his films. The opening credit sequence has probably one of the best opening songs ever played on a soundtrack, Bang Bang by Nancy Sinatra. The tremolo guitar and Sinatra's curious 'almost out-of-tempo' singing summarizes the entire movie, not only in story but in expert execution. Tarantino wisely opens his movie with such a simple arrangement played over credits for over two minutes - a good example of Tarantino loving art more than action.Though of course the film has more action than any of Tarantino's previous films, but it's almost artsy in the way he goes about the action. Every shot has some kind of quirky setup that is purely his. He references countless '70s movies to great effect.Is so many references to other movies plagurism?

Just my opinion of the film is all thats required here...This truly is an outstanding film:Incredible action sequences, great characters (especially the 17 year old Japanese assassin) excellent casting and as has become expected of QT, fantastic music.QT has mixed so many exciting genres of film together to make one truly exciting and stylish film.  Spaghetti Western, Martial Arts / Japanese Anime, and whilst its a brutal film, its also very funny.I love the way that to beat the censors, one of the goriest (and lengthy) scenes changes to black and white to beat cuts.  This adds to the overall style of the film.This film is so exciting, it has made Kill Bill Vol2 my most anticipated film of 2004.KILL BILL KICKS ASS!!!The lack of any worthwhile DVD extras are disappointing - I imagine they are being saved for a final box set later in 2004.	5.0	Exciting from start to finish!!!	2004-04-19	2	1	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1TU84F1NWQSN5	"H. Semones ""soanim8ed"""	It's quite apparent from Kill Bill Volume One that Quentin Tarantino has not lost any of his love for pulp fiction.  From the opening black and white sequence of Uma Thurman to the final almost touching final fight scene with Lucy Liu, Kill Bill has the makings of an epic cult film.  I say cult film because I'm sure the movie will polarize audiences.  Tarantino takes some big risks with his film genre bending and mixing.  Most of them pay off.The action sequences that were talked about are actually not as sustained as rumoured.  In fact, it really shows a sign of maturity in Tarantino that the action takes breaks so the audience can take a breath before the characters start in on each other again.  It makes the characters more human, too, since even those in the best shape could not withstand these constant pounding without taking a short breather.The story?  It's a revenge plot, plain and simple, and as pulpy as those get.  Plus the actors are all quite up to that task.  They all go about chewing up the scenery, which fits quite nicely into the film as it's set up.  It's good to see Thurman again.  Here she takes the lead as The Bride with much vigor and attitude because The Bride is pissed.  Her old assassin team has killed her entire wedding party and even tried to kill her, but didn't quite finish the job.  Now she wants to get even.And it's great fun.  With over the top fight scenes with heads and limbs flying to bodies squirting blood like hoses, Tarantino is wearing his cheesy gore film influences on his sleeve.  There are several film genres here and the best is the back story on Lucy Liu's character when the film switches to Japanese anime to set up the audience for the second half of the film which takes place in Japan.  The dialogue is more classy in this half of the film only between Thurman and Liu.  Instead of using the F-word (as Tarantino is want to do in his films), they shoot more witty barbs at each other as if there was once great respect between them.  This sets up a scene at the end of their fight that is actually touching and makes The Bride human instead of just a killing machine.Of course, the film ends with a cliff hanger because Miramax didn't want to release a 3 hour plus film; however, with some creative editing it ends nicely and sets up for Kill Bill Volume Two.  It gives hints about The Bride's husband, the baby she was carrying, how she was found after going into hiding and her relationship with Bill to name a few things.  All of which are very soap opera, but a soap that is very stylized and willing to take chances.  None of this would have worked had it not been for Tarantino being self-aware he was just making a big piece of entertaining fluff.  In other hands, it would have just been another over-wrought pile of junk.  And even if Miramax cut it in two, it's nice to know that they have allowed out a film that tries to push the envelope.	4.0	Big, pulpy fun.	2003-09-26	58	44	14
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A183RGDCCC913M	"Hugh S. Welsh ""starmer welshmeister"""	"For those of you who wish to see Quentin Tarantino's wiry hide thrown overboard and be made mincemeat of by barracudas, well, better luck next cinematic go-around. In his first feature-length film since ""Jackie Brown,"" Tarantino has shuffled the cards and somehow produced a remarkable hand once more.""Kill Bill Volume I"" - the second and final volume is due out in February - relays the redemptive mission of The Bride, aka Black Mamba (Uma Thurman).The reason for her deathly disgruntlement lies in a botched slaughterfest at her countryside wedding some four years earlier. Five homicidal professionals, formally known as ""The Deadly Assassination Viper Squad,"" ended The Bride's matrimony with a cloud of firearm discharge.Splattering the innards and brains of all those present, including the groom and the chaplain, the lethal fivesome then turned its attention to The Bride, who was a couple of weeks shy of childbirth. The clan opened its barrage with a coarse rendition of ""Ring Around the Rosy,"" in which The Bride was flung from person to person, each member imprinting a mark of ache on her chin. To finish her off, the head honcho, Bill, launched a point-blank bullet into the right side of her skull.Seemingly, this makes her the 10th victim of the execution; however, it is soon discovered that the projectile merely dislodged a cranial plate, preserving her brain, but leaving life in coma. Four years pass, and, thanks to the blood-famished proboscis of a mosquito, the Black Mamba rises from the dreariness, childless and hardly able to move.Bent on payback, The Bride first must manage to make operable her appendages. She is eventually able to rehabilitate herself.Once physically capable, The Bride composes a hit list she calls ""Death List Five."" The list is as follows: 1. O-Ren Ishi, code name Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu); 2. Vernita Green, code name Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox); 3. Elle Driver, code name California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah); 4. Budd, aka Sidewinder (Michael Madsen); 5. Bill (David Carradine).For starters, The Bride sets off to eliminate Green in her suburban bungalow. As soon as Green answers the call of the doorbell chime, she is embattled in a rowdy till-death-do-us-part knife scuffle with The Bride, only to be interrupted by the arrival of her daughter's school bus.However, as soon as the munchkin climbs the stairwell, the skirmish rages on, and the blood-stained Bride waltzes away victorious.But it remains an uphill hike for The Bride. She must fly to Tokyo and quarrel with Ishi and her henchmen known as the ""Crazy 88.""""Kill Bill Volume I"" is an eye-popping bloodbath made complete by flawless dialogue, a scintillating musical score and stylized camera movements. Hell, there's even an homage to Japanese anime, used splendidly to show the youthful disturbances that led to Ishi's ascent to the position of Tokyo crime boss and assassin."	4.0	`Kill Bill Volume I' is high-octane, holy-hell fun	2004-09-27	1	1	0

W	If this is cliamed as Quentin Tarantino's best, then I'd wonder how much talent as a director he has.The film is a gross copycat action of Hong Kong's martial arts movies (if you have watched tens or hundreds of them, you'd know). Tarantino apparently has watched many of them and tried to create his own, but lacking creativity and originality is the biggest issue of this movie. For those not watching many martial art movies, it looks fresh, so Tarantino might think the movie have some market in U.S. He is right in terms of revenue generated.The movie is gross and violent, the blood shed in the movie could well support a car wash if you want a red car. But grossness and violence are never the essence of martial arts. It is an art that makes you wonder how beautiful the move is, not how many legs or arms are cut. Jet Li's early films made in Hong Kong truely demonstrate such art. Since when Uma and Lucy become martial arts experts?I'd not waste my money on the second volume.	2.0	Gross and violent, lacking creativity&essence of martial art	2004-09-28	7	3	4

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A15447PSN3C8ZP	ijcast	In my opinion, a lot of anime (Japanese animation) is way better than a lot of the crap we see in the theatres these days. The cuts, the storyline, the graphic imagery is so much more compelling to me. With that said, it's really fun to see a movie that blends a lot of anime-inspired ideas into live-action. I can't recall any other movie that has tried to do such a feat and do it so well.  Yes, there are showers of blood as enemies get cut into many pieces, but the movie isn't really gorey. Tarantino's movie turns blood and violence into some dark ballet of death and it's frighteningly entertaining. At time's your apt to laugh at the fight scenes - not so much because of their absurd nature, but because it reminds you of some martial arts movie or some anime that you've seen before. And that's not to say that Tarantino &quot;ripped&quot; off other movies, but that he has chosen to use some of their spirit and ideas into this one. I would have given this movie a higher score, but it seems that the character development is somewhat shallow. I didnt really feel a need to care about the main character (Uma's character). And it seemed more like watching a train wreck (an entertaing train wreck). Still, Kill Bill is a fun movie, but don't expect a tear-jerking experience. It's action, done with Tarantino's keen eye for cool and inspired work.	4.0	Basically a Live-action Anime	2004-06-21	2	1	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3LY5FW9I1QJ5N	Internal Abbatoir	"First of all, I liked Tarantino's first two films. And I used to think that he had a promising career ahead of him, but Kill Bill just doesn't do it for me. These movies are so unbelievably lame that I would rather watch the B-movies that inspired them. That is basically what you are getting here, but ""oh, it's a melting pot of various influences, you say?"" I know what Quentin set out to do here and I don't like the final results. It seems like everyone's favorite video store clerk just can't come up with anything decent anymore. Jackie Brown was a total lackluster attempt at trying something different. Kill Bill is Tarantino returning to what he does best, but the material is just not as entertaining as his previous efforts. Poking fun of rednecks and white trash yet again... didn't we already cover that in Pulp Fiction?What is with the repetition in this film?Revenge is the theme here, but unlike most revenge films you just don't care about the bride's quest for vengeance. Yeah, so she was shot in the face. Big deal... Movies like ""I Spit on Your Grave"" and ""Old Boy"" are much better revenge flicks. You actually feel like something horrible/inhumane has happened to the main character and you want to see the perpetrators suffer the most violent deaths imaginable. In Kill Bill you may actually fall to liking the bad guys even more than the bride. What does that accomplish? Nothing, really... this is a basic Tarantino movie. You go to see it to be entertained, but I wasn't very entertained. Often times I can overlook the superficiality of Tarantino's work, but not here because this movie suffers from an overall lack of creativity. And if I feel like I am in the mood for Asian cinema or Spaghetti Westerns, then I will watch them. I don't need to see a film that rips off of them, or rather packages them together nicely into a finished product.In other words, Tarantino has had an accomplished career. His first two movies are among the most influential of the 90's, but guess what... he is no longer the newest thing. His movies are no longer cutting edge and hip. Let me just put it this way: Quentin ripped off of his favorite directors and since then everyone has ripped off of him. Seeing a movie with Tarantino influences is not uncommon nowadays. And since there is no depth to any of Quentin's movies, there is just no reason to see them more than once. If that is the case, then what makes his work superior to George Lucas and Steven Spielberg pop corn flicks? After all, if all he sets out to do is entertain, then that is essentially what his films amount to.... just instead of using cgi he relies on savvy dialogue and ideas from other movies.But, I will be sympathetic here... and give him three stars for effort. After all, even if this movie is not the masterpiece that people make it out to be it is still better than most of the tripe that Hollywood produces nowadays."	3.0	Lame	2006-07-09	8	3	5

Alvi	This movie has the feel of a comic book brought to life (in fact, the first half of the movie actually has a segment consisting of comic book animation).  This stylistic choice enables Tarantino to present a lot of potentially very disturbing material, especially abundant violence in Volume 1, while making this material reasonably palatable (and I generally don't like watching violence).  It also gives the movie a sort of surreal and twisted feel which makes the movie suprisingly engrossing.  On the other hand, the plot and characters are relatively cartoonish (though the acting is solid), and I didn't really discern much deeper meaning in the movie, despite a total running time of about 4.5 hours.  In short, this movie is entertaining in a way that might even tempt you to watch it more than once, but don't look for anything more than entertainment.	4.0	Entertaining in a way that only Tarantino can entertain	2010-10-03	0	0	0

Now to the plot.The plot is about a woman named ""The Bride"" of course not her real name, it just isn't revealed until part 2. The Bride (Uma Thurman) used to work for Bill(David Carradine) as an assassin, she decided to settle down and get married, but Bill betrayed her and shot up the wedding chapel and put a bullet in her head. Leaving her in 5 year coma, she wakes up, realizes her baby's gone and proceeds to get revenge on the 4 assassins and Bill.POSSIBLE SPOILERS UP AHEADThe assassins are1. O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu)2.

My guess is that those who didn't like this flick didn't know or notice those and took this movie &quot;as is&quot;. It is not good &quot;as is&quot;, that is the point. It is an homage to bad class B flicks that the teenage nerds used to love. Now that we are in our thirties, we love to see all that silly stuff remembered in this flick. And we love to see how many different sources we can catch during the film! Everything from cartoons to Star Trek to Babylon 5 to Bruce Lee to Kato/Green Hornet to spaghetti westerns to Battle Royale to simple cheap action movies that only young teenagers like...

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3GZF79IS1SN4	Jacob Reidt	OK, first things first.  It's really violent.  I don't think I give anything away there.  Second, it has a few really cool visual effects.  After a while though, one gets the feeling that Tarantino has put together a pretty silly story in order to pay homage to a genre that he loves.  I guess he's entitled to do that, but I won't be running out to buy it.  There is always something much too strong for the average stomach in QT's films, and this one is no exception.  The trucker/comatose-victim 'joke' is just sick.	3.0	Fun, but Indulgent	2004-04-22	8	2	6

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AYBBGS1NYXG8B	"jadedromantic ""jadedromantic"""	I missed &quot;Kill Bill Vol. 1&quot; in theaters because in some ways it just didn't interest me.  I wasn't a particular fan of anyone in the cast, nor of Tarantino the director (though, as an actor, I thought he was one of the best things about &quot;From Dusk to Dawn&quot;).  By the time the DVD came out, I was curious about all the hype, and had made 2 new friends who were absolutely nuts about the movie.  They brought it over for me to see.It now ranks as one of my favorite films ever - and, along with &quot;Kill Bill Vol. 2&quot; (which I saw the day it was released), is not so much a movie as an &quot;experience&quot; that I can't forget --I am a Tarantino Turnaround - now a HUGE fan.Uma Thurman (who I am now also a huge fan of) plays The Bride, basically a hired assassin formerly known as Black Mamba who decides to leave her gang of hired killers and get married, after discovering she's pregnant.  Bill, the leader of the gang, has other ideas ... and in a dusty wedding chapel in the deserts of El Paso, Bill and his little band of murderers simply walk in on the wedding rehearsal, and shoot everyone dead ... eight corpses plus The Bride, who Bill finishes off himself with a bullet to the head.And that's only the beginning!  Four years later, The Bride wakes up from a coma; she's survived the slaughter!  But there's no baby, no life -- and no mercy.  She decides to exact a huge and bloody revenge on all members of the gang -- ending with Bill, whom she is most determined to kill.The movie is briliant eye-candy, also a great tribute to martial arts films, of the 1970's especially.  The action/fight scenes are impeccably shot -- when The Bride goes up against the Crazy 88 gang, you will NOT move from your seat for even a second -- and even an animated sequence chronicling the backstory of killer O-Ren Ishii is nothing short of phenomenal.  For those nay-sayers who complain of this film being all style over substance, all I can say is 1) what do you expect from a revenge flick? - and 2) when you see part 2, you will see how wrong you are.One of the most brilliant, bloody, funny, and engrossing films I have ever seen, &quot;Kill Bill Vol. 1&quot; is Tarantino showing many of his more famous counterparts how a director can make a film so much his own, give it so much his own signature.  I can't explain it, really, but it's just the feel of the movie - with this one, it's NOT a movie, it's more an EXPERIENCE that stays with you a long time; a director's vision so fully realized, it's startling to watch.  Brilliant movie, and if you've seen it and haven't seen the sequel ... you haven't seen the whole story.	5.0	Tarantino Turnarond	2004-04-24	1	0	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3PSSGQMXRH8AR	"Jad El Balaa ""e-commerce businessman"""	What can I say, is this what society has come for? All I see is great reviews about a movie that has a large number of scenes of females being butchered and killed in such cold blood. This is morally disturbing as movies tend to present what the social standards may accept. Is it cool for women to butcher and get butchered this way? Movies are not just movies; they are the images they create. And these images are important because have a certain inner effect on society. Even though women are being portrayed as evil in the movie, it is still not morally acceptable to picture them being butchered and sliced. This is unthinkably annoying and highly unethical. As far as I see from the theme of that movie if a women works of an evil organization, then it is ok to butcher her arm, or her head and hear her scream in pain as she suffers and blood pours out! Can you see how ugly the picture is? And the hero is a cold blooded killer. This is how the hero is portrayed.My view of women is they are the beautiful image of humanity which is to be cherished, loved, and cared for and they bring joy, progress, and happiness to life. Not the view of brutal slaughtering and dumped as how they are portrayed in the film. It is very disturbing the amount of such violence in movies these days which is highly portrayed in this film.I know this genre of movie is supposed to show this kind of action and that it is men and women being butchered, not just women. Although not great, we got used to men's violence movies that many of us don't actually get affected by it. However this is a new much more horrible trend which many people dislike and will not get used to. This slautering of young women in cold blood is really terrible and the movie shows with blood spurting from their neck, and arms and stomach ...My personal opinion is that it is just a very disturbing image to show to a society that has high moral values.	1.0	"Is it hereoic and ""cool"" to slaughter?"	2005-08-18	33	10	23
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1F5R98E05T2TP	"Jaime J. Lim Jr. ""jjl_j"""	(waiting to see vol 2, especially due to high critical review; making up for vol 1 shortcomings).  tarantino's style and taste may not be for the average viewer (anyone who disliked pulp fiction, reservoir dogs, natural born killers, true romance) and it may turn off those with narrow visions.  although he has had his hand in films like desperado and from dusk til dawn, those films pale in comparison.a fact is that desperado and the 2nd half of from dusk were robert rodriguez's film.  rodriguez is a good friend of tarantino and i'll give him credit for being able to produce entertaining movies on a low budget but, he is nowhere near the caliber of tarantino.  rodriguez can be called a good director with ingenuity but he'll NEVER be a great one like tarantino (once upon a time in mexico was the biggest proof of that; johnny depp was the only redeeming element of that sequel).back to kill bill, this film (which was split due to time constraints and tarantino's refusal to delete scenes to please the studios) was done to pay homage to all the cult films he loved while growing up and working at a video store.  if you've ever watch old school kung fu films (shaw brothers: 5 deadly venoms, bruce lee's game of death: yellow &amp; black track suit), japanese samurai films (lady snowblood: geisha assassin, lone wolf and cub; shogun assassin), sergio leone's spaghetti westerns (all the clint eastwood films) and so much more i can't recall, you'd watch kill bill more with a keen eye.it's so much more than just graphic violence.  it's about style and innovation.  it updates past film noir into modern millenium visuals.  viewers shouldn't go into this believing this is your typical action and violence film.  it's an awestrucking rollercoaster ride into a cinematic experience.i anticipate vol 2 will even be better....	5.0	a movie that pays homage to cult classics...	2004-04-16	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1IKDTKKMERUB1	Jai Normosone	This edition of the movie is as close to the original vision that Quentin Tarantino had for the movie as you will get (of course, discounting any future release where the two parts are reformed and re-released as a single movie).I'm not going to write a review on the movie as it has been done by many other people - this review is on this edition of the DVD.Simply put - there are no black & white bits where QT had to scale the movie back in order to obtain an R-rating (instead of NC-17) and it is definitely worth purchasing this edition over the R-rated versions. I would say to the true fan to have a copy of each but I prefer this edition over all others.There are no extra scenes and the menus are all in Japanese but that is easy enough to work around.  Other editions of the movie that I have also don't have the subtitles for the scenes where Japanese is spoken - but this one does.English soundtrack is 5.1 (default) and DTS.  English subtitles are easy to locate as well.You will need a machine that will play multiple regions in order to view (or be able to set to region 2).	5.0	As Close to the vision as you can get!	2010-02-07	1	1	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3HSA7050DR9UG	"Jake ""jaker5064"""	Okay, there is absolutely no need to tell any more about Vol. 1's plot unless you've just jumped down here without looking at the top reviews. Anyway, Tarantino's most recent BIG project was Kill Bill, a two-hour epic of blood and hate. From the opening credits to the final cliffhanger, this flick has Tarantino written all over Uma Thurman's triangularly shaped forehead. He's resurrected his trademarks like the jumpy time sequence, very deep morals found only between the lines, crime bosses, that kooky dialogue we've all come to know and love, and even some newer tricks have come out of his sleeve like the amazing anime sequence and homage to even more obscure film genres we've never heard of.There is, of course the issue of violence and gore associated with this film. Anybody who can laugh at Monty Python's infamous Black Knight scene can cope with it but even still will be shaking their heads in a mix of emotions somewhere between sheer horror and pure hilarity. One scene within the climactic battle scene was even purposely put into black and white in order to keep an R rating. Overseas in countries used to that level of ferocious death, like Japan in particular, it was shown in full bloody color, while if seen over here by our children's minds the entire project would've had an NC-17. It's truly a shame when true art can't be expressed to the world in its full glory (or whatever you'd personally want to call it). Another problem about the film is the cutoff in the middle of the script. Howard Stern said that he would've loved to see it in its complete four-hour length, and even though salivating can be good I'm a little tired of waiting after this many months.Still, despite the little concerns, this is a fantastic movie. And yet, there is a certain magic about it that's almost impossible to explain. From the deep benevolent yearning to pick up The Bride and cuddle her with her bloody teeth, to the way you can truly relate to those times when hate has surged through your body like a powder keg as it does hers, you can feel this movie. Not in a Braveheart sort of way with naught but bagpipes to carry the emotion, but in a true and real way. Uma Thurman's already been nominated for a Golden Globe in this. Hopefully she'll win and when the next installment (which will completely outdo the first, I already cheated and looked at the screenplay) comes around I'll be the first in the theater for the midnight showing. And oh yeah, buy the DVD.	5.0	A grindhouse spectacular!	2004-01-21	4	1	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AL5OEDM8TPTKV	James Hiller	"Ok, this is NOT a film that I'm supposed to like. My boyfriend continously chides me for only like little, character-driven indie flicks that make you ""think"" (case in point, my new favorite film, hands down, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind). This is definitely not a film that you have to think, riddled with excessive violence, and a story filled with unanswered questions, and let me tell you, I absolutely LOVED this film.It's pure, pure, pure Tarantino at his finest.Kill Bill Vol. 1 is, as Quentin himself states, is a pure revenge flick. The (...)Uma Thurman plays ""the Bride"", whose wedding day is the scene of a horrible massacre, in which she somehow survives. Coming out of a coma after four years, she seeks revenge on the squad of hit-divas and it's lead man, Bill.  So, for two glorious hours, we are treated to violent scene after violent scene of gore, dismemberments, beheadings, and outright murder. And you know what, I loved every second of it. Why?First, I know this word is bantered around all the time, but truly, Tarantino IS a film making genius. His vision, his filmmaking style permeates Kill Bill Vol. 1, This is a sleek, beautiful film. Even the fighting scenes are so incredibly choreographed that I thought I was watching a well-rehearsed dance number in a musical; well, a dance number with lots of blood. LOTS. But dear Quentin has his finger on every part of this film, and it's a cinematic piece of art.Secondly, the performances of the actors carry this film, particularly Uma and the sultry Lucy Liu. Uma has never looked better as a bride with a mission that never lapses into outright anger. She is controlled, and in control. It's so refreshing to see a lead female character take control of a situation, rather than relying on a male lead to save her. Uma don't need anyone! And Lucy is a phenom as head of the Toyko crime syndicate. She is both feminine and brutal, absolutely marvelous in her role. My only complaint was Quentin's brief use of the stunning Vivica A. Fox, as the first female assassin ""the Bride"" confronts. She just isn't in this movie much, and I wanted to see more.Reading some of the reviews and articles about Kill Bill, Taratino planned this movie as a salute to Japanese martial arts movies of the 1970s, spaghetti westerns, and other forms of ""grind"" cinema. Not well versed in those styles didn't hamper one bit my enjoyment of the film. It works on all levels.So instead of cringing, I loved Kill Bill Vol. 1. Just don't tell my boyfriend that I'll probably be in line for Kill Bill Vol. 2. I have to see what happens next. And while I'm at it, I think Tarantino's other brilliant work, ""Pulp Fiction"", deserves another look-see."	5.0	Quentin's Genius	2004-04-15	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2DSCQ71JZ2ZU4	James Johns	"It's been my experience that one either delights in Tarantino's films, or they do not.  But those opinions tend to go to the extreme.  Perhaps Tarantino's ""not-so-mainstream"" approach gives his movies their unique appeal.  After all, it *is* human nature to be curious about that which is different.And different ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" is.  It's the little curiosities and snippets of quick wit that give this movie it's surreal humor (yes, humor).  And anime lovers will appreciate the history of Oren-Ishii, a mini-revenge plot in of itself.  Being a martial arts/fitness enthusiast, I was originally attracted to this movie because of its action and super-human Matrix-esque fight scenes.  I was somewhat disappointed as to the over-obviously fake scenes where limbs were severed.  However, this may have been intentional - a homage to the marital-arts movies of the past.Overall, I personally enjoyed the movie.  And yes, I'll be in theaters when Vol. II arrives.  However, if you are looking for stunning visual effects involving computer-generated graphics, then my recommendation would be to stick with Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fishburne."	5.0	An absolute delight for the eccentric palette	2004-02-29	3	3	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ALJGB7XHPFCR	James R. Mckinley	I wasn't expecting to like this movie but it was really great because of it's creativity, style and extremely fitting music. The music, I'd say was one of the best things of the movie, because not only was the music in itself interesting, but really enhanced the film and matched the scenes perfectly. The main thing is that Uma Thurman really hasn't grown at all as an actress and the few lines she does say feel completely wrong and take you out of the film. She's similar to Keannu Reeves and Brooke Shields - nice to look at but awful acting. Additionally, she looks totally out of place as a kung fu warrior. Her arms are so thin and skeletal (not lean and tone like Jennifer Garner) it's like trying to sell Kate Moss as a boxer; and her hands are so big, something's asymetrical and off balance - very unjapanese. And finally, Uma's moves are clumsy, she's like flailing and sloppy. This is expecially brought out in the scene with Lucy Liu, who actually is a black belt, I believe and Lucy's crisp, sharp, quick and precise moves really bring out Uma's newness to the art. However, in spite of Uma's acting being less than par than any of her co-stars, the movie is really slick - although very bloody and violent. Tarantino made a good call to have the most violent scenes in black and white as color would have been too gruesome. I also enjoyd the animated segments of the movie.	5.0	Violent but entertaining!	2004-04-15	1	0	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1O9QYP22X6IS0	Jamie Moore	Kill Bill is a movie that takes place in the strange and dark world of hidden but powerful mafias. It is these mafias that although we don't see everyday but it is about us all the time that is fast shaping the world, a world in which is moving from a statist approach unlike ever before. If you think of past events like Waco, the Oklahoma bombing or even the 9-11 attacks, then Kill Bill is just a small chapter that would  have tied, if it were true, all these tragic events together.If anything, the  violence associated with the growth and development of these mafias especially  in the movie represents the characteristics of the mafia world itself, with their assassins, the quest for power and their ability to go in and out of the underworld to the 'real' world in which we live and go about and do with our every day daily life. Remember it was a wedding that serves as a motif in which the character plays by Uma Thurma lies in a coma for four years that once she wakes up seeks revenge on Bill and his Divas. In fact betrayal and revenge are the major themes that makes this movie come alive and not seem comatose in the violence that borrows its traits from old spaghetti western, 70s style Kung fu movies and so on.Yet who is to say that the director and producer aim was to hit at male teenagers and adults with its dependence of kung fu scenes filled with lots of limbs being cut off and people being hacked to death. It is naive and even foolish to assert such precisely the anime scenes in the movie of the character who represents probably in Japan itself an onging pop culture trend that has suddenly emerged onto the international scene. It is also untrue given the fact that other horror movies like Exorcist: The Beginning had a wide appeal among female movie goers. Then again it would also be wierd to assert otherwise that 'why not' cater to people like myself who likes to see martial art stunts and bodies being thrown about left and right.Kill Bill is no doubt  a must see movie. It could however worked on parts such as the fighting scene with Thurma and Black Mamba in which case the daughter would have known something wasn't right when she comes home from school and see glass knocked on the floor and broken furniture. I would supppose a child like that would have felt that something was wrong right there and so too the audience.	4.0	Great movie! Lots of blood and gore though!	2004-11-04	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A8EO864QVNMC2	"J. A Miller ""conjammenson"""	This movie is a modern take on classic kung-fu movies.  It would seem to me that the only people who understand this are the ones who are fans of kung-fu movies, or able to see when something is supposed to be a certain way for a certain reason.Throughout the movie people lose limbs and shoot blood like crazy.  I have heard complaints that it is cheasy and un-realistic.  ok, time to get out of your box people.  The reason it is like that is because that is how the old samurai and kung-fu movies are.  This theme is demonstrated throughout along with the music and sound effects.Kill Bill v.1 is non-stop action.  From beginning to end it grips you into the story; which is very intriguing in itself.  The story is great, and the film being shot out of sequence in chapter form makes you pay attention to what is going on even more.My advice would be not to see Kill Bill v.2 before seeing v.1.  Because they are actually one whole movie done in two parts.  Because KB2 is more story line than action it may turn you away.  KB2 is more enjoyabe after seeing the KB1 and you are already pulled into the story.	5.0	Watch for What it is and Enjoy!	2004-04-26	4	2	2

Featuring a caucasian lead within the realm of Japanese style film making, the issue of race does come up more than once, however it is apparent that this film is for EVERYONE, and that ""silly caucasian girl who like to play with samauri swords"" can indeed bring it!The Bride (Uma Thurman) is a woman seeking revenge against her former colleagues, a group of assassins who left her for dead after murdering everyone who attended her ill fated wedding. After waking up in a coma approx. four years after the fact, she travels from coast to coast, and aiming to right the wrongs and even the scales in her favor.The cast is excellent. Uma Thurman gives in the best performance of her career in my opinion, while Vivica Fox makes a tough first impression in the film's opening. Most of all, Lucy Liu is terrifying as the Yakuza boss O-Ren Ishii, inspired by another Japanese revenge film, 'Lady Snowblood.'The film itself is an orgasm of light and sound, featuring beautiful fight scenes and liberating justice; Quentina Tarantino's style serves this picture well, and I can hardly wait for the inevitable Vol 3. in the future!"	5.0	A breathtaking martial arts epic	2006-04-28	3	3	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3OUCPLJ5K70D9	Jason P	Exactly. Kill Bill vol. 1 itself is a great action flick. It's extremely gorey and violent to almost a comedic extent at times but for fans of martial arts movies or Tarantino, it will not disappoint. However this is, obviously a rushed DVD. There are very limited extras and since vol 2 is out in theaters, it will only be a matter of time until we see the special edition with deleted/extended scenes, and a collector's box featuring the 2 volumes together in time for christmas. Be warned that during one particular ultra violent action scene, the screen flashes from color to black and white in order to avoid the NC-17 rating. If you want to see Tarantino's film uncensored, then buy the Japanese import or wait for the next dvd release. If this doesn't bother you and you just want to see the movie you saw at the theater then pick this up. Just please don't give Miramax your money twice.	2.0	Great Movie.

I understand that you cannot compare a masterpiece to something that is just a fine piece of film making, like Kill Bill is.  It's just the unbeliveable gore that is shocking.  Not only does the spraying blood start to become humorish (which had to be the intention), it also is distracting from this outstanding thriller.  This is not something, the faint of heart should watch, but for those thrill seekers out there...Quentin wants to take you for a ride.  I cannot wait for Vol 2.	4.0	Style and Gore	2003-10-29	5	2	3
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A13BLSXL78EMRX	Jason Troy	"Comas are a deep sleep wherein a victim is neither living nor dead. The mantle of darkness protect the soul from the reality which put it there. However, an ancient proverb states, that ""if the spirit has unfinished business in the world of the living, then woe betide those who put it there."" Such is the premise of Kill Bill. Once part of an elite group of world wide assassins, 'B.B', the victim, {Uma Thurman} awakens and recalls well who tried to kill her. Throughout the rest of the film, viewers are introduced to her former friends all code named after the world's most venomous snakes. Not sure of the reason why she was nearly murdered, "" Black Manba"" as B.B. was code named, (The deadliest snake) goes after each of the assassins. It has been suggested, were Bruce Lee to have lived, this vehicle would have been his. Instead, the story was redesigned with a feminine twist and all the explosive action and martial arts confrontations were designed in the fertile mind of action Director Quinton Tarentino. From the first to the last, exciting sub-plots and well-choreographed martial arts scenes give this film it's special quality. The main target of B.B.'s revenge is of course none other than Master (Kung Fu) David Carradine as Bill. It is he and his 'Snake"" team which consists of Lucy Liu who plays O-Ren Ishii, Vivica A. Fox as Vernita Green, Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver and Michael Madson who now become the intended targets. Interest in the film is ample as each killer has their own story and each contains the special formula of subtle sex, exciting physical confrontation and superb samurai action. In the end, what can be said of Kill Bill One? If this film is fantastic, I can't wait for part II. (of which there is) Excellent."	4.0	Revenge and The Black Momba	2007-09-22	3	3	0

You need to know what you are getting before watching, this first all and foremost a pure exploitational flick, Tarantino knowswhat he is doing...and he does it on a big budget, why not?Swords, revenge, bloody fights, torture, fights with ninjas - dont take it too seriously!Some of the folks here, whine about the shallow characters, hey don't look here if you want a character piece, please go watch Ghandi instead (a good movie actually).Characters here are just instruments for the story...and having Uma Thurman makes it very interesting, not to mention Michael Madsen.A cool movie, love the ending .

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"After the many kudos and great reviews this film has received, and having enjoyed Quentin Tarantino's other work such as ""Pulp Fiction,"" I was truly ready to enjoy ""Kill Bill."" What a surprise then that I found it dreary and couldn't wait for it to end!The plot of Kill Bill is very simple: a woman assassin (whoa!) played by Uma Thurman, has been attacked and left for dead at her own wedding. She recovers and wreaks sweet revenge on her attackers in one-on-one, mano-a-mano martial arts fights. That's about it. The live action is intercut with dark anim&eacute;-style cartoon sequences. Dramatic lighting, acrobatic swordplay and stylized blood gushes give the film an almost comical cartoon feel of its own. While we have seen this sort of thing in other martial arts films like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Hero,"" Tarantino ramps up the action with graphic dismemberment, beheading and disembowelment. Some scenes are literally awash in blood. In a way, this is a welcome relief. Many films show swords slicing enemies, but few show the effects. Yet the effect in this film does nothing to lift the action out of its own numbing repetitiveness. There is no narrative arc to maintain interest in the characters. The heroine is already expert in her art, so there are no inner obstacles to overcome. She is just a nearly-invulnerable killing machine, let loose on other nearly-invulnerable killing machines. Halfway through the film, with no additional plot lines to keep my interest, I couldn't wait for the end credits.""Kill Bill"" is drenched in blood as well as excessive and (IMHO) completely unnecessary profanity. Though some fight scenes are well-staged (the opening knife fight in a suburban kitchen is a standout), the rest were too predictable to keep my interest. I missed the last 20 minutes of the film, and I don't expect to see them -- or ""Kill Bill, Vol 2,"" for that matter."	2.0	Tidal wave of blood and bore	2005-01-10	11	5	6

It is unique, bizzare but overall enjoyable. I don't wanna say the synopsis, other tham watch the trailers. Origianlly, Vol. 1 &amp; 2 was siupposed to be one long movie ( a friend of mine spliced them on his computer so Vol. 1 has no closing credits and Vol. 2 has no opening credits). This is fast paced and action packed, and right after watching this half of the story you want to see how it ends.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AF66815FWU1OJ	Jeff	This movie was very over hyped, which is why I watched it.  I truly was hoping this movie would be something new and great.  Well, as far as new goes, yeah its slightly original, but its definatly not great!  It was so stretched out and got very boring at times.  There were so many parts in the movie that just shouldnt have been there.  If you watch this movie, ((which I honestly dont reccomend you do unless you really have nothing to do for the weekend)) you will know what parts I am talking about.  You can easily tell that these useless scenes were added to merely make the movie longer.Another problem I have is that Kill Bill has been made into two movies when it could have easily been made into one movie.  Like I said before the delay and drag out Kill Bill 1 and its obvious that it is only done to make money off of a sequal for it.I think that this movie had potential, but they went about it all the wrong ways.  I also have problems with the realness of the movie which I usualy dont care about.  But in this movie it got rediculous.  Everyone in the movie that gets stabbed litterly could paint a wall with their blood from fifty feet away from it.  Its as though they all have extremly high blood pressure.  Its the worst and stupidest looking violence I have ever seen.  And thats saying something because I never mind violence or gore, but in this movie it was just stupid gore.I will not say only bad things about this movie as I did give it two stars meaning its not the most horrible peice of trash that I have ever seen,  but it is deffinatly amongst the worst.  One thing I liked about the movie was the plot.  As I said before it is quite original.  In the beginning of the movie it seems quite promissing, but the problem is it never delivers.  It dissapoints you about halfway through the movie and makes you slightly regret starting to watch it.  The main reason I gave this two stars instead of only one is because of the very horrible 'Soap Opera' ending of the movie that somehow very oddly gives you the urge to see the sequal even though you know it will be a waste of your time and mind.All in all, I would only reccomend this movie to you guys or girls who are alone and have nothing to do for the weekend and really just want something that will keep your attention.  Because it does somehow pull that off.  But if you really want to watch a good movie with friends or something along those lines, then get 'Man on Fire' when it comes out on DvD and Video this September, or The Matrix Trilogy...Bottom line, there are so many better ways you can spend your time.  Dont waste it on this movie unless you honestly have nothing whatsoever to do.	2.0	Way over hyped...  Truly one of the worst movies I've seen.	2004-08-13	19	7	12
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y	Jeffrey A. Thompson	"This movie has many points going against it. Uma is not all that believable as the world deadliest woman assasin. The stunts are adequate, but not spectacular. Quentin steals ideas from really bad movies. The movie is homage to various kung fu, karate, shogun, spaghetti westerns, Japanese revenge movies. The action sequences are over the top. Quentin throws in cutsey touches. For example, the cutsey flashback scene when we learn ""The Bride's"" real name.However, the movie works for me. Uma plays the Bride like a female Clint Eastwood: strong and quiet. The character may not be believable, but she is sympathetic and entertaining. The plot works and how Quentin tells the story keeps the story interesting through both volumes. Both volumes viewed as one movie is a masterpiece. How Quentin ties the movie together is amazing. He uses the different cinematic styles to reveal plot points and character development. The characters are complex and their relationships are interesting. It is hard to give the movie justice in just a few words. There is poetry here in how Quentin tells his story and he fully entertains at all times."	5.0	It is the style.	2006-01-14	4	4	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2K4MKGDCHZI4U	jeffrey	"Kill Bill Volume One is one of the greatest films of all time. After the subpar Jackie Brown, its great to see a film that lives up to the name of Quentin Tarantino. Though based on the character ""the Bride"", I felt the film was truly original.  The film is great, and I admire the sarcasm and creativity of Tarantino. He's a genious, and you can't deny that, when he makes a film as brilliant as Kill Bill Volume One after making masterpieces like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2V3P1XE33NYC3	Jeffrey Leach	"I basically forgot about Quentin Tarentino for a number of years. After watching the fantastic ""Reservoir Dogs"" years ago, followed by the even better ""Pulp Fiction"" a couple of years later, Tarentino seemed to drop off the radar. Occasionally, you would see his mug turn up on one of those television talk shows, or hear about him doing an interview somewhere, but his career as a director seemed to have hit the skids. Then he did ""Jackie Brown,"" a film that certainly embodied many of the Tarentino stylistic elements (wrapped around a still foxy Pam Grier), but failed to compare favorably with his two earlier efforts. Fans of the man sat back and waited patiently for his next project, which turned out to be the hyperkinetic ""Kill Bill Vol. 1."" This film reaffirms one essential fact about Quentin Tarentino: he's one of us. What I mean by that is that he's a fanboy of the sort of cheap, cheesy cinema pumped out of diverse locations such as Asia and Italy. The Spaghetti western is what I'm talking about, and chop socky potboilers from the great old days of Hong Kong. His knowledge of these usually ignored films is incredible; I've seen my fair share of low budget cult classics, and many of the references in ""Kill Bill"" soared right over my head. But I know enough to see where he gets his inspiration, and it's nice to see someone paying homage.Why even discuss the plot of a film so overanalyzed since its release? Because I like to write to excess, so here goes. The Bride (Uma Thurman) survived an assassination attempt carried out by her former partners in crime, specifically members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and has just woke up from a lengthy coma. Her last memory is, unfortunately, the sort of memory that would give the rest of us a coronary; she remembers the enigmatic leader of the group, Bill (David Carradine), putting a bullet into her head. Now she's wide awake, having lost her unborn child, and ready to get back out on the street to seek revenge against her former associates. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, they say, and boy are they right! The Bride works hard to restore her body and mind to pre-injury levels, and makes a list of five people who must go down for the agony she has endured. Victim number one is Vernita Green (Vivica Fox), who perishes after an ultracool knock down drag out fight in Green's suburban home, a fight that pauses long enough for Green's little kid to go up to her room after arriving home from school (!). The next killer to go down will be O-Ren Ishi (Lucy Liu), a scary thug who now runs her own organized crime racket in Japan.Before taking down Green and Ishi, Thurman's character heads to the Far East in search of the elusive Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba), a sword craftsman extraordinaire and the man who trained Bill himself in combat techniques. But there's a big problem: Hanzo has had a change of heart and isn't interested in making weapons anymore. The Bride must convince him that what she's doing is right, which she does, and the craftsman makes his best sword for her so she can carry out her revenge plots. Hanzo's clout carries such weight in the underworld that O-Ren Ishi visibly pales when she learns what The Bride has accomplished. That's all in the future, however, as Thurman's character must battle her way through a veritable army of dangerous goons to get to O-Ren Ishi. The sinister Gogo Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), a willowy teenager who is a whiz with painful looking weaponry, is Ishi's personal bodyguard. So are the Crazy 88s, the yakuza goons that form the central pillar of Ishi's organized crime network. In a finale that one must see to believe, The Bride wreaks havoc--no, apocalyptic carnage--on O-Ren's criminal empire. Gore, blood, limbs, and assorted other body parts soar through the air as Uma goes on a one woman killing spree of epic proportions.I could go on and on about the various details of the movie, such as the animated sequence telling the story of O-Ren Ishi's transformation into a professional assassin, but I won't go into more particulars. ""Kill Bill"" is a film best experienced for oneself. I think it's wonderful that people--most of whom would never watch the sort of films Tarentino lovingly cribbed from for this masterpiece--went to see his movie in the theaters. Now do you understand why we obsess over cult cinema? Even if you don't understand the references in the film, you can still get a kick out of the over the top performances, the scorching soundtrack, and that ultracheesy atmosphere Tarentino throws around all over the place. I loved the sound effect we hear whenever The Bride homes in on one of her targets, a sort of loud siren effect that must have had viewers scratching their heads in bewilderment. My favorite part of the film was none of these things, though. I have to say Lucy Liu was the best part of ""Kill Bill Vol.1."" For such a lovely looking woman, she's downright chilling as O-Ren Ishi. I thought she did a phenomenal job with her role.The only extras I saw on the disc I rented was a music video and a behind the scenes feature. I wouldn't even consider buying this disc right now because you just know they'll release a double disc set of both films, probably with a third disc chock full of extras. Incredibly, I have not seen ""Kill Bill Vol.2"" yet. I know, I know--I'll bump it up on my rental list as soon as possible. I don't know if the second installment is as good as this one, but hopefully it is just as entertaining."	5.0	Awe inspiring	2004-10-13	5	5	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AHWD01P6DQPOM	jeff smith	No other film of 2003 celebrated the pure joy of filmmaking with more mindless gusto than Tarantino's genre hopping, balls-to-the-wall, go-go bloodbath. Kill Bill Vol I is a big, gaudy shrine to style over substance - the cinematic equivalent of graffiti, loud, colorful & highly stylized. The film opens with a bang and doesn't stop for a breath, culminating with The House of Blue Leaves sequence - a stunning piece of action filmmaking and one that will be hard to top. I hope Vol II lives up to the very high expectation set by Vol I, but even if it doesn't, at least Tarantino has given us a nice little taste of superficial, spaghetti Western, blaxploitation, samurai, kung-fu eye candy. Sure, it's hollow but so are Faberge eggs. If you're looking for a meditation on the human condition, look elsewhere. But if want to see a filmmaker practice a masterful exercise in visual stimulation, Kill Bill Vol I is definitely for you.	4.0	One half of Tarantino's fourth film	2004-01-13	2	2	0

WRONG!!  This movie is so bad that I had to turn it off after about 45 minutes.  Probably only the 3rd or 4th time I've had to do that in my life, so that's pretty bad.  It is very slow-moving and boring, and it constantly strays away from the point.  You have to sit through about 15 minutes of cartoon-fighting which I thought was retarded.  If I wanted to watch cartoons I'd borrow my nephew's DVDs.  There wasn't nearly as much fighting or violence as in his other movies (at least in the first half) but of what violence it did have sucked.  And the parts where he tried to make it funny were not at all funny.  They were stupid.  I can't believe this movie sucked so bad!  What a huge disppointment.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	I've been fascinated with this movie ever since it came out. This movie being a revenge plot is very pulpy. Plus the actors are all quite up to that task. They all go about chewing up the scenery, which fits quite nicely into the film as its set up. Thurma takes the lead as The Bride with much vigor and attitude because The Bride is pissed.There are several film genres here and the best is the back story on Lucy Liu's character when the film switches to Japanese anime to set up the audience for the second half of the film which takes place in Japan. The dialogue is classier in this half of the film only between Thurman and Liu. Instead of using the F-word (as Tarantino is want to do in his films), they shoot more witty barbs at each other as if there was once great respect between them. This sets up a scene at the end of their fight that is actually touching and makes The Bride human instead of just a killing machine.Towards the end the film it sets up for Kill Bill Volume Two. That being said, Tarantino has provided viewers a film that is a dazzling combination of action and visuals that will delight some and frustrate others who are looking for more depth. The film shows that Tarantino is a talented and visionary filmmaker who is the master of mixing action, quirky characters, over the top action, and twisted humor to create a symphony of theatrical originality. Highly recommend for those who can handle it.	5.0	Don't mess with Uma	2005-12-17	5	4	1

And, except for the girl with the ball and chain, the characters are not particularly memorable.  I didn't find myself identifying with, liking, or even rooting for any of them.Unfortunately, even the best production and effects can't make up for a weak backbone.

Most of his movies ( Pulp Fiction, Dusk Til Dawn1,2,3 etc.) are entertaining, but have been done before or at least have a totally familiar theme. Well now, Quentin just decided to lower the bar even farther. Take B-grade kung fu movies, B-grade western movies, Japanese Animation movies, and steal the most famous scenes out of them. Then throw in tons of people getting killed. You might think this would equal action, but no, it gets old in two minutes. Both volume 1 and 2 are horrible.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2GVJ83F092MIS	J. Hayes	"Many people on Amazon would disagree with thetitle ""masterpiece"", finding the over-the-top blood and violence to be too much and unnecessary. Whatever your opinion Tarentino is undeniably a cinematic genius. His knowledge/love of martial arts/samurai movies is clear, and the man knows his stuff. I am not a fan of old kung-fu movies and still pick up references in the movie that point to his paying homage to a genre he is knowledgeable within. I saw Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, both great flicks, and the patented style is again used to tell this story.Kill Bill Volume 1 begins as a woman known only as ""The Bride"" has been beaten and shot to near death. The ones responsible--The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (of which the Bride was a former member) and Bill. Bill was her boss and also the father of her unborn child. A massacre ensues when the Bride is about to marry another man, but the killers made one mistake--not killing the Bride. Even if I didnt tell you this you would figure it out very quickly---The Black Mamba (the Bride's codename) WILL get her revenge.This movie gets some negatives from people for being so violent and at times sloppy. Tarentino had that vision and it couldn't have worked better. Blood unrealistically sprays when limbs are chopped off which of course is exaggerated almost to a comedic level but not quite. The question is did Quentin pay homage or rip off the genre? The answer is he has ripped off elements to an extent, but told the story in the way Tarentino does. He combines traditional elements of Kung-fu and adds his style to give us nothing more than a superviolent revenge flick. It is a damn good one at that. To say he has blatantly ripped off everything is far-fetched. He has a deep love/appreciation for Samurai movies and he knows what he is doing here. He truly wanted to leave his mark on the genre and the result, Kill Bill is one that will stick around for a long time. I was literally amazed at what I saw the first time through and it is just as fun a ride the second, third, etc. times watching it.This has been said and I will say it again: if you can't stomach the violence and blood to the extreme do not watch Kill Bill. If you are a Tarentino fan it is your duty to see this great movie. If you arent a fan give it a shot anyway. With so many styles, including Anime, this is a stylish, yet violently unrelenting epic that will be remembered. Watch the movie for what it, a story of a woman screwed over who deserves revenge against those who took the most precious things from her. Dont dismiss it as a bad movie because you don't like profanity or gore. Then question yourself as to Tarentino's brilliance. All that aside this is the best movie I have seen so far in '04 and I cannot wait to see Volume 2.The picture and sound quality are very good on this release, with a Dolby Digital Surround track and a DTS track for those who have the capabilities to hear that. Only negative I can give this dvd is the lack of extras. You just know with a movie like this one there is so much more out there as far as bonus material goes. As for me, I am happy to own this great movie and I recommend you to at least see this movie, if you can stand violence that is."	5.0	Another Tarentino MASTERPIECE	2004-08-09	6	5	1

The actors don't even know how to hold a sword properly (not to mention posture) and that's a shame because even I can wield a sword much better than any of them.

This film is all about watching cool stuff and nothing else. I'm aware that this is a post-modern film, exploiting some elements from films made in the past, but this film is not a good movie.P.S.

Though I believe its from his head and partially based off the kung fu movies he must have watched earlier in his life. I believe that the mans a cinematic genius just the opening the 70's style with the Feature Presentation in the opening and how the movie transitions into animi was just incredible. i'm kinda pissed that some are still hung up on the cliff hanger I just don't understand. Tarantino originally wrote this movie as a three hours long epic revenge story. Though he cut it into two movies what's the big deal.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2A6NH6DPE0VXR	"Jim ""Pimmy"""	I just saw Kill Bill volume 1 for the first time today and I thought it was great despite it being extremely strange and violent lol. The people that don't like it, must have made the mistake of taking it seriously. I mean the Bride (Uma Thurman) is sitting on a plane with a big sword next to her while making a check list of who she wants to kill. That's pure dark humor, that right there is saying that it's not meant to be taken seriously. It's not meant to be realistic. Plus most the dialogue seems like the way a child would talk and not grown-ups. I admit some lines didn't work and made me cringe but they weren't bad enough for me to dislike the movie.  It's meant to be silly, cartoonish and yes extremely violent. When you think about it, wasn't Pulp Fiction the same way ? People are acting like Quentin Tarantino lost his touch but he didn't at all. Plus Volume 1 is basically just a half of a movie so shouldn't judge it until you see the second half. Tarantino took a big chance just releasing one half at a time and it's not fair to hate it when you didn't even see all of it. If you put your time into the first half, then do the same with the second half and then complain if you don't like it....	4.0	Bring on Volume 2!	2004-04-13	5	3	2

Many of the action scenes were actually boring as they went on and on.  Tarantino beats us over the head again and again with the whole revenge theme.  Yes...We get it!

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A12W99SK787ZJ9	"J. J. Chiappelli ""jjcx"""	"I guess I would be more merciful and give this movie a 2 (or even 3 star rating, if I was in a good mood), but the utter disappointment I felt after watching it and Volume 2 was so powerful that I feel compelled to rate it even lower.""Kill Bill"" is not a good movie.  The acting is atrocious and the story is stupid.  Then again, Kill Bill was not recommended to me on the basis of its story or acting---it was hyped-up because of its action scenes, its direction, and its humor.  And none of these three things are particularly great.Firstly, the direction.  Okay, so, Tarantino did a couple of quirky things, but they didn't lend themselves to the movie very well.  Switching from color to black and white in the middle of a fight might be a very good way to direct a scene if it achieved some purpose---but instead, it's just something for people to point at and go, ""Look!  It's DIFFERENT!""  The movie is full of little experimental things like that which are cool in their own way, but don't actually make the movie any better.Then we have the humor.  Pretty much all of the humor in the movie is supposed to come from one of two sources:  either over-the-top gore that is meant to be hilarious, or over-the-top shocks.  The shocking moments are neither shocking or funny, such as when The Bride wakes up to find out she's been prostituted by her orderly.  It's not shocking because the acting and pacing of the scenes are miserable, and it isn't funny because there isn't actually any joke about.  Tarantino assumes that shocking material is inherently funny, but it isn't.  You need to actually set up a joke and have a punchline in order to make people laugh.The over-the-top gore is actually a great disappointment.  Go see the movie ""Bad Taste"" and then you'll see what I mean.  Bad Taste is full of cartoony, over-the-top violence that is funny because it is extremely unrealistic.  The gore works in that movie because it is consistent and the tone is right.  In Kill Bill, the tone is consistently boring.  The gore doesn't seem funny in the context---it just seems stupid.Finally, we come to the action scenes.  These are the greatest disappointment out of everything in the movie.  There are basically two big action scenes in the movie---the fight with Lucy Liu/her henchmen and the fight with Vivica A. Fox.  The latter barely lasts a minute and a half and is so poorly shot that it fails to be exciting.  The former stretches slightly past five minutes, but because there is absolutely no suspense (Of COURSE The Bride will live---we know that there's another movie coming up), the fight is incredibly dull.What you really have here is a piece of randomly assorted scenes that ""pay tribute"" to terrible movies from the seventies.  People hail this as the final great mark of genius in the movie, but unless you have seen every bad movie from the seventies, it really doesn't mean anything.  I could make a movie that pays tribute to a bunch of math textbooks from the fifties, but unless you are a hardcore math professor with a lot of time on your hands, you probably wouldn't like my movie.  Why should any of us non-trendy, uneducated types really care about Kill Bill when we are unfamiliar with the source material?This is a terrible movie.  Do not see it.  Do not buy into the hype.  If you want to see something that's full of crazy gore and ridiculous humor, but that's actually GOOD, then check out any of Peter Jackson's early movies."	1.0	Easily the most over-hyped movie of 2003.	2004-08-13	73	35	38

Yes, it's got a lot of blood and gore and it isn't very realistic- the bride would have had to pull a lot more out than an IV if she had been in a come for four years- but the fight scenes are good, and the showdown at the house of blue leaves is fantastic. I loved Gogo's character and also Lucy Liu's portrayal of O-Ren. And the last fight scene between the bride and O-Ren was done very well.. the lightly falling snow and the beautiful Japanese garden really added to it. I've watched it many times and still am hooked. If you can enjoy a quirky movie that isn't supposed to be realistic, you will like this one.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2W79ZQAH159NA	J. K. TOMA	"Remember watching late-night Saturday Kung-Fu Theatre as a kid, and lying there with the lights out thinking how great it would be if these films could be on every night?  (Uhm...or maybe that was just me). But watching this DVD put me back in that place during my youth when I admired characters with a code of honor, and where villains, having their own stories to tell, reciprocated that same level of code.Quinton Tarantino's film, `Kill Bill Vol.1', is a rare triumph in cinema, as is it's creator, who, it seems, is one of the few in Hollywood today who has the vision to create unique, and brilliant motion pictures.Tarantino's quirky, fast paced, dialogue is ever present in `Kill Bill,' and although the film is not like his previous gritty mosaics where the characters carry guns (Katanas are the desired instruments of death in this film), `Kill Bill' is still very similar stylistically.  Do not be mislead.  This is not a watered-down Tarantino flick by any means.  In fact, `Kill Bill Vol. 1' may be his bloodiest film to date.In `Kill Bill Vol.1' we come to know Uma Thurman only as ""The Bride,"" a former member of The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad who has been victimized by the very same group on the day of her wedding.  ""The Bride,"" however, survives the massacre, and after coming out of a four year coma, she realizes that not only has she been the victim of a horrific event by the same people she once worked with, but that she has also lost the child she was carrying in her belly up to that day.  The seeds of revenge are inexorably planted.The events that follow are an amalgam of Kurosawa, Wu Tang, Troma, and Sergio Leone.  Tarantino is a master of stylization, and should not be considered a plagiarizer, as I have heard so many critics label him as.  If that were the case, then every well-known writer, director, creator, artist, etc., is guilty of plagiarism.If you enjoyed `Kill Bill' in theatres, then you will be pleased to know that the DVD not only delivers the film in wonderful clarity, but its special features make a wonderful addition as well.  `The Making of Kill Bill Vol.1' is well made and gives you a perspective as to the layers of work it took to produce the film.  The bonus musical performance by ""The 5,6,7,8's"" was a nice touch.  The movie trailer portion was the only aspect of the DVD that left me wanting more.  While the trailers for ""Kill Bill Vol.1"" were fine, the back cover of the DVD is a bit deceptive in the sense that it does not actually include the trailer to Vol. 2, but simply a 30 second teaser; which provided no anticipatory scenes from the coming film.  I figured it would make sense to provide an adequate trailer, considering the DVD was released only two days prior to the theatrical release of Vol.2.There aren't any major inserts in the box; just a film synopsis and background to its creation.  However, the `Kill Bill' action figure and miscellaneous movie memorabilia insert definitely caught my eye.This film is many things.  I have often heard or read comments accusing Tarantino of making unintelligent work, but I cannot disagree more.  There is a reason why Tarantino has such a loyal following, and why many, including his staunchest critics, flock to the theatres to see his films (I will make a prediction that this film comes in at #1 for box office revenue this weekend and next weekend as well, if not the week after that too).  Tarantino's films are filled with real people, who act and speak like real people, and are put into situations that allow them to make decisions like you and I.  Sure, his scenes or locations may be a little grandiose, lofty, and high-flown, but they are bold, cleverly thought up, and are intended to entertain.`Kill Bill Vol.1' is colorful, bold, and brilliant.  This is NOT one of those movies you rent (I would tell you if it were... just check out my other postings coming soon).  I recommend that you see this film, and that you PURCHASE this DVD.  Who knows, maybe you might be home one Saturday night and have the urge to put something on that makes you reminisce to the things you enjoyed in your youth (Uhm...or is it still just me?)."	5.0	Colorful & Brilliant, 'KBv.1' is Tarantino through & through	2004-04-16	1	1	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A8F2AZWB20X1H	JLind555	"...slice 'em and dice 'em.  Well, it's fun to watch.  It isn't very deep, but it's fun.  It's a pretty simple-minded plot: The Bride (a/k/a Black Mamba), very well played by Uma Thurman, is hit by a death squad on her wedding day and left for dead in a coma.  Four years later, she screams herself awake, kills off a thug who is violating her in her comatose state, and the joyride begins.The way the movie rockets along, we wonder if we're watching a movie or reading a comic book.  The Bride is out for revenge on the death squad that killed all nine members of her wedding party (""They should have made it ten,"" she gloats, as she whacks her first victim, Vernita Greene, a/k/a Copperhead, played by Vivica Fox; all these assassins are named after snakes, for some reason) in front of her four year old daughter just off the school bus.  Then she's off to find her nemesis, a gorgeous Chinese-Japanese killing machine named O-Ren Ishii (Cottonmouth), played by the lovely Lucy Liu.  Their boss behind the hit, Bill, is mostly unseen and unheard, and evidently we have to wait for Part Two to see why he ordered the hit to begin with.In the meantime, there's gore galore all over the floor as The Bride mows down everyone who gets in her way.  Some of the action is so over the top that we wonder if we're supposed to take it seriously or say ""yeah, right"" and laugh out loud, as when O-Ren's posse of hired thugs take on The Bride all at once and all end up dead or mutilated.  Uh-huh.The film's cinematography is jaw-dropping, zipping from color to black/white to anime and back to live action; we're reminded of the mixed sequences that Oliver Stone used so effectively in ""Natural Born Killers"".  As for style vs. substance, ""Kill Bill"" is weighted so heavily in favor of the former that substance is almost an afterthought.  There's been a lot of comparison between this film and ""Pulp Fiction""; there's blood and gore liberally splashing the screen in both movies, but ""Pulp Fiction"" was a masterpiece of great plot (convoluted though it was), great acting and great dialogue.""Kill Bill"" ultimately boils down to great style, a lot of noise, and one fight after the next.  On a rating scale, I'd have to give it  five stars for style and two for substance which averages out to 3.5 stars, but it's great fun to watch so I'll round it off to four.  Let's just hope the story gains in substance in Part Two.Judy Lind"	4.0	Slam-bang-chop-chop...	2004-04-24	7	5	2

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2B0DPQK20LYYJ	J. Michael	"I remember hearing two ex-coworkers raving about this movie when it came out. One of them was a backwards-baseball-hat-wearing Neanderthal with a ""tribal"" tattoo around his steroidal bicep, and the other was a keg-bellied 30 year old boy who still played video games. The endorsement of such people was all I really needed to know about this movie, but I guess ultimately I'm too much of a fair-minded rationalist to hold unsupported opinions, so I gave this movie its day in court. After seeing it, I have to say that I think there may be something to be said for the validity of prejudice. This movie reeked.""Kill Bill-Volume 1"" is a shallow, boring and interminable cat fight. Since everyone knows the protagonist is in no real danger (after all, Uma Thurman is on the cover of the DVD for Volume 2), there's no real drama or excitement here, and since Tarantino couldn't be bothered providing us with even the most basic character background or development, I couldn't care less why Uma's erstwhile comrades tried to assassinate her or how she will get her inevitable revenge in the sequel.The movie amounts to nothing more than hot chicks fighting. For your average American fathead, I suppose that's all that's necessary. Everyone thinks that Tarantino's homage to cheesy 70s blacksploitation and martial arts flicks is cleverly ironic but I think those genres are actually the man's true artistic cynosure. He's not being brilliant when he references low budget cinematic ephemera- he's just showing that he's an arrested adolescent with no taste."	2.0	I think I'll be skipping Volume 2	2008-04-20	17	2	15

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	A film by Quentin TarantinoKill Bill is Tarantino's fourth film, and it is his first film in at least 5 years.  He is known for his stylistic dialogue and pop culture references built into an interesting story.  Kill Bill is a variation on that.  Tarantino is paying homage to the B-Grade Kung-Fu movies of the past.  This means that Kill Bill is extremely violent (as opposed to the usual Tarantino perception of violence), but it is an exaggerated, over-the-top style of violence.  Originally slated to be a single, long, three and a half hour movie, Kill Bill has been cut down into two parts.  Volume 1 sets the stage for what is (thus far) an extremely simple story.Kill Bill is a story of revenge.  That's it.  That's the entire plot.  A woman is at her wedding, is beat up, shot, and left for dead.  Four years later she wakes up from a coma with revenge on her mind.  We don't know her name, because her name is not important.  She is known as The Bride (Uma Thurman).  She has a list of people to kill.  There are five names on this list.  The last name is Bill (David Carradine), the man who shot her.  Bill was the leader of a group of assassins, of which The Bride was once a member.  The other assassins were the ones who attacked her at the wedding.  The film opens with The Bride going after the second name on the list, Vernita Green (Vivica A Fox).  Kill Bill plays with chronology a little bit as the first name on the list, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) is the second person we see The Bride attack, but comes later in the film.  This is a typical Tarantino storytelling technique.We have an amazingly simple plot for Kill Bill, so what is there to recommend in this movie?  Tarantino's movies are usually love/hate with no middle ground, but I've loved them.  Honestly, what you'll get with Kill Bill is a stylish, over-the-top, action movie laced with Tarantino's dialogue.  For all the hype that The Burly Brawl got for The Matrix Reloaded got, I felt let down by both that fight sequence as well as the entire movie.  Kill Bill has a fight sequence that eclipses both the potential of the Brawl as well as the execution of the fight.  Kill Bill is almost all action, and it works incredibly well.  There is quite a lot of blood, but I wouldn't say this is a gory movie at all.  There is not a lot of realism in the blood, yet it doesn't take you out of the movie because of how well done everything is.I loved the movie and eagerly await Volume 2, but I can only give a qualified recommendation because I know that Tarantino's work is not for everyone.  If you are already a fan of Quentin Tarantino, then by all means, this movie is for you.  If you are not, nothing in this movie will make you like him more.  If you have never seen a Tarantino movie, and you like action, give this one a shot.	5.0	a simple plot, but it was a blast to watch	2003-10-21	3	2	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3RQB2W820QCZA	Joey F. Kolber	With Kill Bill, you have a line drawn, those who love it and those who hate it. Either you like it for it's cool action, sharp and witty dialogue, creative and fun characters, and well choreographed style and well shot cinematography. Or, you hated it for it's over the top violence, simple story, and interesting casting. Either way, this is one well done film. Now, there is no doubt that Tarantino is one of modern times best filmmakers. He is a noncomforist filmmaker of sorts, who still sides on a more independent note than trying to put out the Next Big Thing. And Kill Bill is his message of this: rather than trying to create a pop culture flick that will make tons of bucks, he's created something he can enjoy. In other words, this is Tarantino's fanboy film.The film itself is qute simple. A former assassin goes on a rampage of revenge to kill the man who took away the life she wanted to have. But in retrospect, the film is more about it's characters than what they do. Uma Thurmans 'Bride' is not just a one dimensional killing machine. She's a woman who lost her baby. An ex-assassin who just may be the world's deadliest woman. She's someone who you could be good friends with, as long as you don't get on her bad side. While most of the other characters aren't nearly as well developed, they do at least have interesting enough backstories to them. And, at the very least they are interesting.One other thing you know you can get from a Tarantino film is great writing, and thats no less true here. The film sparkles with great dialogue. Whether it's Uma's narration (which are very well voiced) or the exchanges and banter between friend's and foe (Sonny Chiba's scene being one of my favorites), there is a bounty of great lines here. Yes, some of it seems a bit out of place, but the style is just so darn cool, you can't help but go along with it.As for the action, it's some of the bloodiest to have graced the screen in a while, but it's also quite stylish. The choreography is well done and the fights are creative, ranging from teenage girl with a chained and spiked ball (resembling something out of an anime) to a fight in a homemmakers suburban house, the battles are entertaining and spark the imagination.Now, I will say, this movie isn't for everyone. Yes, it is overly violent. Yes, it does have an unusual style that is mostly in service of Tarantino's own fandom. But, the film is cool, stylish, and one great time. And, if you like Quentin's previous works, you're in for a treat, because this is one of his best to date. Now stop reading this, and go get this movie....now!	5.0	Don't let poor reviews fool you, this is a great movie!	2005-09-28	2	2	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3CL82UITQJLWS	John Doe	Kill Bill is one of the most entertaining action movies I've seen in years, though it's very graphic &amp; violent... so definitely not for kids. I'd include it in a list of my top 10 favorites. Uma is amazing here, wow, she kicks major a**. This movie has a very beautiful style to it. The music was enjoyable and fits the movie perfectly. I'll probably buy the soundtrack as well. I rented this movie then returned it, only to buy it the same day, it's that good. I didnt really care for a few things: the switching to black &amp; white then color again- because the color in this movie is fantasic, the occasional subtitles- I always have to pause the movie to read what they say cuz it's so fast, however I can understand and respect the director's reasoning for it to keep Kill Bill's authentic japanese feel, and also the japanese anime- I didn't come to watch cartoons. Visually this movie is amazing though!! It blew me away. I really liked the plot and I thought all the actors did a great job. The stunts and sword fights are top notch. (Uma's steel is sweet huh?) The DVD features both Dolby Digital &amp; DTS 5.1  The &quot;special features&quot; are really lacking here unfortunately. Bonus performances by the &quot;5,6,7,8's&quot;? You're joking right? I really wish they would've made this a 2 disc collector's edition (like Pulp Fiction), but I imagine they probably will a few months down the road. Special note to the genius director...Please keep making movies Mr.Tarantino!! Your fans want a Kill Bill volume 3,4,5,6,7,8 too. Anyways, this movie rocks. Highly Recommended!	5.0	Thank you Mr. Tarantino !!	2004-04-17	2	1	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1G7F9ZDJ07EMA	John	I knew from the beginning how dumb it was going to be.  Uma Thurman knocks on the door and her and Vivica Fox start fighting.  Then there's some cussing.  Then more fighting.  Then we go on to more scenes.  More fighting.  More cussing. Enter Lucy Liu (who sucks by the way).  More fighting. More cussing.  Get the gist yet?  That pretty much about sums up the movie.  Fighting and cussing. And not to mention overdone graphic blood scenes to hide an otherwise inept plotline.  Oh and by the way, who was Bill?  Oh yeah that's right, we have to see volume 2.  So in other words, Tarantino is cashing in for two movies because you would have to see whatever the hell is going to go on in the second one.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3A48XEYWLWH7T	John IV	Sunday, April 18, 2004 / 4 of 5 / Cinematically impressive homage piece.  Incredibly, Kill Bill v.1 goes beyond suspension of belief to allow us to consider Uma Thurman an anti-hero, death dealing instrument of carnage.  This hodgepodge homage to manga, anime, spaghetti westerns, and kung fu films works well and was great fun to watch on DVD and a bigscreen.  The action is framed marvelously, particularly the showdown with Oren.  Lucy Liu once again steals the show with her mouse that roars techniques, particularly her quick dash across a board table for some `face time' with a dissenter.  While not as supple and attractive as her appearance in Dangerous Liaisons, Uma comes off a lot better than the more recent Hysterical Blindness where we're asked to believe she's a barfly having trouble getting some action.  Uma plays the pregnant `Bride' who is shot and left for dead on her wedding alter by her ex-boss/lover and assassin squad co-workers.  After four years in a coma she awakes and seeks revenge against all five.  The violence is abundant and stylized, especially the arterial spurts from samurai sword cuts.  The tributes to old-school kung fu and noir films abound and it all looks marvelous if a bit staged.  Fans of the Lone Wolf and Cub manga will appreciate the final showdown with Lucy in a gently snowing park, the combatants run at each other as is the custom to make their final slices.  One must fall.  Pretty well all action and little exposition, this film sets the table for its more cerebral second part, hitting the theatres now.  Slick and deadly, with great production values, Kill Bill will enter the upper pantheon of action thrillers just as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction did before it.  Recommended.	4.0	Cinematically impressive homage piece.	2004-04-18	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1COW0UIB5HA9J	"John Lindsey ""John"""	"A woman named ""The Bride"" ( Uma Thurman)has been shot by her former boss ""Bill"" ( David Carradine) and his squad of professional assassins during her wedding with a bullet in her brain that puts her in a coma for 4 years.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3DTN37OQKBHBH	"""johnmarshall64"""	I have to confess to being a little dismayed by reading all the reviews here.  No question, KILL BILL, VOLUME ONE is flashy as it can be, but it is an extraordinarily superficial film.  One of the reviewers below indicated it was all style and no substance, and I think that is a dead-on assessment.The reason the reviews depress me is that it shows how easily people can be duped by presenting a brilliant surface despite nothing existing beneath it.  Compare this with John Woo's Hong Kong films, in which there is also brilliant surface with significant content underneath.The truth is that this is a solid, fun to look at, gorgeous film, but it isn't anywhere near the level that PULP FICTION, RESERVOIR DOGS, or perhaps even TRUE ROMANCE (which was scripted by Tarantino).Look folks, if we keep accepting films like this as masterpieces, Hollywood will think we have no standards, and that they can fork anything over to us and we will accept it for what it isn't.Let's get pickier!  If we don't, Hollywood isn't going to give us better films.	3.0	Baffled by the unstinting 5 star reviews	2003-12-04	9	6	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	APVLZ8UE9MX9	Johnny Dentino	Excellent Fall movie entry by Tarantino.  A great mix of 70s kung-fu and low budget violent gems pay homage to these movie genres.  There is even an anime bit spliced in.  I say spliced, but everything in this film is melded together very nicely.  I do not think many could get away with such a combination, but Mr. Tarantino does a great job; seamlessly putting everything together into one film.  And this comes from someone who was not a big (gasp) Pulp Fiction fan.  All and all, an intelligently violent romp which should appeal to fans and new comers alike.  I look forward to Vol. 2.Also thank you Mr. Tarantino for bringing Iron Monkey to the USA, as well as helping to convince a certain director into making Once Upon A Time In Mexico; two other great movies in their own right.	5.0	Kill Bill Is Kill-er	2003-11-11	8	6	2

It is a film that shall be remembered for a long time. Uma Thurman plays the bride who is out for blood and revenge on her former partners in crime after they beat her senseless and leave her for dead on her wedding day.Luckly the bride survives and wakes from a coma four years later and will not rest until her former partners are dead. The movie has awsome dialogue and Uma's performance is spectacular. The action sequences are brilliant and just plain cool. The film has a very martial arts syle feel to it. If you are a fan of the action genre than this is a must have DVD.	5.0	GREAT ACTION	2004-10-17	3	3	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AYUFQY3XG4ZBR	"Johnny Sideburns ""21st Century Renaissance Man"""	"From Clarence Worley's first attempt to pick up a floozie in a cocktail bar for a tempting date of ""THREE kung fu movies"" (all starring Sonny Chiba) in ""True Romance"", it was obvious that the screenwriter -a then-unknown Quentin Tarantino- was a huge fan of Asian martial arts cinema.Eventually he turned up wearing a Chinese shirt in an introduction to the Miramax US re-release of the Hong Kong classic ""Iron Monkey""...and we all knew it was just a matter of time before he made his own martial arts movie.Watching a ""Hong Kong"" action film made by an American is like listening to rap music performed by Europeans.  It can be technically proficient and even highly enjoyable, but at its core you recognize that there is something just fundamentally artificial and wrong with it...which is why this movie is so hit-and-miss.On the plus side, the action sequences are absolutely stunning; even the blood geyser FX during the swordfighting, classically over-the-top and more reminiscent of anime' than martial arts films, does not seem as absurd as it would in any other film.  The editing is as edgy as you would expect, and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful.  The action scenes are an adrenaline junky's dream, no argument there.  The film techniques from live action in living color to stark grainy black-&-white to animation are inspired and properly put Tarantino back in the ""cool"" zone of directors.But the story itself...revenge plot on steroids...just feels incredibly contrived.  The charm, if you can call it that, of Asian martial arts flicks is their hopelessly over-the-top nature.  Impossible acts laced with impossible dialogue exacerbated by eve more impossibly bad English dub tracks.  Add to the fact that Uma Thurmann, not the most gifted of actresses on her best day, makes an effort at overacting that would embarrass William Shatner and you start to get the impression that she is Mrs. Mia Wallace re-living her role as Raven McCoy (""the deadliest woman in the world with a knife"") from her ""Fox Force Five"" pilot as recalled in ""Pulp Fiction"".Overall it's a good film, well-worth seeing...far better than I thought it was going to be (the Bruce Lee tracksuit from ""Game Of Death"" was really too much, though...pay all the tribute you want, Q, but even Bruce Lee's WORST effort is beyond the reach of mortals)...and the cliffhanger ending was completely satisfying and definitely an appetite enricher; the bases are loaded for a drive home of Sadaharu Oh proportions."	3.0	Heartfelt homage or bald-faced rip-off?

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A25LNKK0X36T11	John T hinman	"According to Tarantino, Uma is his ""muse"". Whether or not that's true, I've come to the conclusion that the two make a remarkably resourceful team. Anyone who was entranced by Therman's unstoppable performance in the gritty Pulp Fiction will be equally amazed at the job she does in Kill Bill.Once again, Tarantino pulls out all the stops and makes a film that hasn't one iota of modesty. Therman (The Bride) is beaten, shot in the head and left for dead while pregnant, and later becomes the target of two rednecks looking for action anywhere they can--even from unconscious hospital patients. But that is not to say that The Bride takes her misfortune lying down. The movie itself is a wonderful chronicle of her bloody, no-holds-barred revenge, a revenge which extends to anyone and everyone who gets in her way.Her revenge is played to the tune of the good old days of film-making, with definite references to shoot-em-up westerns and sword-slinging asian kung-fu films. Those references being what they are, you have to take the unbelievable amount of blood and violence in this movie with a grain of salt. There's a reason that when a character's head is cut off, his neck becomes an almost laughable fountain of blood. Every bloody sequence is well-orchestrated and obviously planned piece by piece. If this movie had had ultra-realistic violence and an atmosphere that did not feel like an redone classic, this film would be worthless.The film itself is a testament to how wonderful a director Tarantino is. No one could have pulled off a revenge movie this straight forward and received the box office acclaim that Quentin did. When I had first seen ads for this film, I was disheartened. I assumed it would be a bad flick that was just playing the name card with Tarantino, without living up to the prestige and magnificance of Pulp Fiction and Resevoir Dogs. I couldn't have been more wrong. Everything comes together in this film. The soundtrack plays like something from a Spaghetti Western with modern flare and a sexy edge, and it fits the story nicely. I absolutely loved the music transgression in the opening sequence of pulp fiction and this film definitely rivals it.Along with the soundtrack, there is a wonderful amount of Tarantino flare. My only complaint here is that with that flare, the movie follows the same path that pulp fiction did: all the scenes are mixed up, and there are chapters. It's been done. However, it's been done very well once again. In addition, Tarantino finds various hooks from a seemingly endless bag of tricks that he apparently can still work from. An enormous fight scene involving the bride versus a veritable army is excellently choreographed and fun to watch. Also, there is a long anime segment halfway through the movie. I really don't care much for anime, as I know most people don't, but it fit fairly well into the story. I do have a complaint about that segment and that is that it was very very long and fairly overdone. You get the feeling that it was an excuse to show an exorbitant amount of blood and that they held onto that for too long. However, you must once again take the violence with a grain of salt.In any case, Kill Bill should not be missed if you understand what Tarantino was trying to do here and you appreciate a good, well-written movie that doesn't care about being pretty. If you don't like blood and rediculously vile sex references, don't think about seeing this movie. if you're open minded and want to be taken on a good ride, you should check it out"	5.0	Once again, Quentin and Uma do a fantastic job	2004-07-02	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ADYTOXX6V8Q8I	Jonathan Clark	"Amazon only allows me to give whole number reviews, but this movie is a three and a half stars out of five. To begin, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE A WEAK STOMACH, blood, guts, gore, and violence is not a lack in the forth film by Oscar winner Quentin Tarantino. This is not ""Pulp Fiction"", nor is it ""Jackie Brown"", the story is not that complex, it is simply a story of revenge, but unlike other movies dealing with revenge this one was done alittle bit better. Thurman does an outstanding job, which could quite possibly get her an Oscar nomination, or at least a Golden Globe nom. Blood was defiantly not a shortage of on the set, the opening scene alone a couple of people got up and exited the theater after Uma gets shot in the head, apart from that at most there might be three minutes of non-violence between the begining and the end, but even with all of the violence the movie is not that bad. Tarantino, as in all of his movies still has that 1970s in mind when it has to do with the music and basically the entire atmosphere of the film. The downfall of the film came when the more minor characters were given such great character development, when some of the main characters seemed alittle flat. Overall the film is a good example of an action, drama, comedy, Tarantinoesc film that is good fun for anyone who likes action to see."	3.0	Kill Bill	2003-10-23	5	1	4

The movie is just as dark and disturbing as any other he has made, if not more so. the one thing that i am still getting over is some of the cinematography techniques used in the film, the use of animation and b/w film is unique to say the least, i do think that some of the scenes in the film are unneededly lengthly, but as i said, it does set a new standard for sword fights in a movie, totally, utterly, and completely. the special effects used in one scene alone is amazing, and movie goers will be using this as a standard for a long time to come, if they have strong stomachs. if you think that the grittiness of pulp fiction was as far as a movie could go, i think that kill bill meets or beats that standard, in fact i said needlessly long scenes? that is one of the many tricks up tarantinos sleeve, (...)	4.0	defenitely a new standard, of somthing...	2003-11-10	3	0	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A25CQTB313XDWO	"JON STRICKLAND ""Jon Strickland"""	Quentin Tarantino has done it, again! Kill Bill, Volume 1 is a trademark masterpiece that has the morbid blend of excessive violence and wicked humor a la only Mr. Tarantino.Well displayed are the acts of revenge executed by a woman whose mission it is to nurse her scorn against all enemies that have dared to stand in her way and ruin her future hopes. Graphic and bloody scenes, action-packed anime, and the preoccupation with daydreams full of vengeance are all elements that create the psychological interplay among the characters.Never before have I known for there to be such a combination of vengeance, sadism, megalomania, and narcissism, all rolled up in one package. At the beginning, Uma Thurman's Black Mamba sets the stage for how the tone of the movie is going to be set. She makes it clear that though she is rational when it comes to dealing with her enemies, her rationality is not the kind that includes mercy, compassion, or forgiveness. And this overture gives the viewer only a taste of what is to come.Without giving the details away, this movie is so violent that it is, without question, not for children to view.Central to the developing storyline in Kill Bill, Volume I is world-renowned, Japanese martial artist and actor, Sonny Chiba, whom Quentin Tarantino has regarded as one of the main inspirations for his particular brand of motion picture outputs.Kill Bill, Volume I, all in all, is a great movie. If there is any down side or sour note, it is that the movie was filmed roughly half a decade after the death of the leading Japanese actor, Toshir Mifune, who, in America, is perhaps most famous for his role as Toranaga in the 1980 miniseries, Shogun.Potentially, there might have otherwise been an opportunity for Tarantino to provide another actor the chance to earn the level of recognition that was highly deserved, just as he had done with John Travolta in Pulp Fiction. It is reported that though Mifune could speak English, his lines were always dubbed in the American films in which he appeared, a major disappointment that would plague him until his death in 1997.	5.0	TRIX ARE FOR KIDS, BUT NOT THIS MOVIE!!!	2004-04-30	3	2	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1YTCTY24AOKMF	Josh Andrews	Though I've never seen any other film by Tarantino, including Pulp Fiction, I'm very interested after watching this amazing movie starring Uma Thurman, called Kill Bill, Volume 1.This movie's basically about a bride-to-be who finds herself waking up from a coma she's been in for 4 years, only to realize that the ones who she onced worked with, the ones who had orchestrated the plan to eliminate her, had stolen the one thing precious to her...her baby. Amazingly surviving a brutal beating and a shot to the head, Uma's character, codename &quot;Black Mamba&quot;, quickly sets out to seek revenge...her ultimate goal being to kill the one (who was the father of the baby), Bill.This film is filled with comedy (thankfully, not to where it has so much that it ruins the movie), suspense, action, gross-out/outrageous scenes, and surprise after surprise! This movie will ultimately leave you wanting for more...and now that Volume 2's hit theatres, those wanting more will be satisfied. Volume 2 won't disappoint.For all the bad things that have been said about her, Darryl Hannah (through both volumes) does an amazing job playing an one-eyed assassin whose goal's to ultimately defeat the &quot;greatest warrior she had ever encountered.&quot; Her character, Elle, is a slightly mysterious, yet creepy character who wants nothing more than to put an end to The Bride. But, nothing major will happen between Elle and Black Mamba until the second volume.The action scenes in Kill Bill, Volume 1 are amazing! The fighting is something else...like...how could I describe it... &quot;perfected-fighting&quot; --- by this I mean, fighting that's interesting, stylish, and overall amazingly breathtaking. The action scenes are that outrageous and they'll leave you wanting for more. Uma has some pretty interesting battles, including a major one between Lucy Lui's character and the &quot;Crazy 8&quot; group, as well as the back-up group, the &quot;Crazy 88&quot; .... The Crazy 8 really is crazy....the creepiest member being a young girl named Gogo wielding a spiked steel mace that also has razor blades sticking out of it....'What she lacks of in years is made up for in madness'... something to that effect, anyway.Kill Bill, Volume 1 is basically an outstanding movie that movie lovers have been longing for... a movie about revenge, filled with lots of action, some comedy, and a plot which anyone could relate to...seeking revenge on those who take the most treasured thing away from you.A definite two thumbs-up! 5 Stars for the first volume of Kill Bill!	5.0	Perfect!	2004-04-16	1	1	0

Taratino is a master storyteller, just like M. Night Shalahlie -something. Kill Bill closely resembles Pulp, in its crypted storyline, and you won't really get most of it, after watching the first volume. So do yourself and favour and rent or buy the second volume along with the first. This ain't for kiddies and chances are some of the bloody scenes might get you shocked or grossed out.

There is a beat and it is inevitably followed by the caption ""Old Kligon Proverb.""Thank you Quentin Tarantino (and Ricardo Mantalban) for that!  As soon as we see it, we know that Kill Bill is going to be a fun movie, made for geeks who love fun movies.  It carries directly in the tradition of Asian martial arts movies, but it takes more from Japan than it does from Hong Kong.  Tarantino obviously has seen the Lone Wolf and Cub and Zatoichi films.  There is a lot of swordplay with katanas.  Just like in the Japanese films, the plot is ""an unstoppable swordfighter who has this adventure...""  Uma kicks butt, taking on dozens of opponents at a time.  As in the Japanese films, every time she slashes someone, she hits an artery and the blood GUSHES out.This is a very gory film, so be warned.  It is also a heck of a lot of fun.  There isn't that much story and there certainly is no closure (for that we have to wait for Kill Bill Volume 2).  However, QT once again demonstrates what a natural born filmmaker he is.

I won't bore anyone by recounting the plot, as many others have done that ad nauseum. What I will tell you is that I think the movie is extremely entertaining, and that ""Q and U"" have created a highly memorable movie character. QT certainly borrows loads of cimematic and stylistic techniques from previous eras and multiple genres... but so what?!?! He is confident enough to create films that will not be confused with any other directors, and much of his borrowing is tongue-in-cheek. IN the end, perhaps the most important question about any moviw where you KNOW there's a second installment is whether or not you'll go see it.

As big of a geek as he is, you gotta appreciate his ability to pay attention to detail but not be overly anal retentive on any one scene. I'm a big geek too. I screamed when I heard there was an anime sequence in the film.I'll first talk about the movie. Its not the movie I'm giving 3 stars. Its the DVD. However, this is NOT Quentin's best film. I love the asian theme's and motifs. Just brilliant. The characters aren't really all that developed but I'm sure they will develop more through dialogue in Volume 2. Which I am looking forward to (I already have my tickets).I'd give the movie 4 stars (out of five). Why not five?The movie is very stylish. Thats its main appeal. But its all style over substance. I didn't like that. A reason I love Pulp Fiction so much is for its characters, which I dont feel close to in this film. Now, I'm not marking this as a bad movie just because its not all what Pulp Fiction is. I know its an entirely different movie, I think Quentin just works better developing story and leaving the style a little to the side. He didn't do that here though, and it was a change. Something that is always good: experimentation. The style is not really always a negative though. Its eyecandy. And that's good. Especially Oren's childhood introduction being told through Japanese Anime. LOVED that idea, and it held the most emotional part of the movie.I just find Volume 1 to be a little underdeveloped. I doubt this is Tarrantino's fault though. Miramax having him cut the movie in half, i'm sure he had to do some really tough editing, and lets hope that volume 2 will make me write a very positive review. Im hoping for big things.The DVD now.It isn't much to brag about. It has a few extras. A 21 minute documentary on the making of the film, some music video's and trailers. Thats it. I highly suggest you wait until Vol 2 is released with it in a bundle. I'm sure it'll be cramed full of goodies. I know there is plenty to talk about, seeing as how this movie had been planned since 1993, during the making of Pulp Fiction.Overall. A great film with a different twist. Too bad it had to be slashed by Miramax. I hope I don't have to Kill them.	3.0	Kill Bill Volume One	2004-04-15	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A14SSWB3ZU6BQR	J.T	"Quentin Tarantino returns to the director's chair with KILL BILL after a six-year hiatus. The movie proves once again that he is a hyperactive visionary and the master of cinematic coolness. Split into two volumes by Miramax in order to ensure that Tarantino's vision would not be compromised (and presumably to sell more tickets), KILL BILL: VOL. 1 tells the first half of the sprawling story, which is quite simple at first glance. A female assassin, referred to as ""The Bride"" (Uma Thurman), is attacked on her wedding day. Dead are her soon-to-be husband and unborn child. However, she doesn't die. Four years later, she wakes up from a coma looking for revenge. Although her ultimate target is her former boss, Bill (David Carradine), it's quite clear that The Bride is saving the best for last. And before she can track him down, she must methodically take out the minions who ruined her life. VOLUME 1's targets include Vernita Green/Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox), Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus), and the heartless O-Ren Ishii/Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu). Using a blessed sword handmade by Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba), The Bride begins her relentless assault. Turning up the style and energy levels that he kept under a threshold with 1997's JACKIE BROWN, Tarantino's obvious glee and reverence for the underground kung fu action pictures of the '70s, and Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns, makes for a stunning visual spectacle. Employing split screens, slow-motion, an anime sequence, and his trademark ultra-hip musical selections, Tarantino's film dares viewers to be unimpressed."	4.0	Kill Bill: Vol. 1	2004-01-19	2	1	1

His other 3 movies of course are all priceless, but this truely a work of art. Volume II's reputaion proceeds it, but if your a true fan of Tarantino's work, then you wouldn't have cared watching the whole film in its 4 hour intirety.And the great thing is, you actually see everything that would be cut in other movies, you see the violence...You see Lucy Liu cut off a guys head, you see Uma Thurman cut off arms,legs,feet,hands and heads. She also cuts a guy down the middle (through his head) which is very spectacular. If you've seen the trailer but not the first volume yet, then the guy jumping on the sword and 36o kicking Uma in the face isn't until Volume II, but hey, it'll be worth the wait.I attended the Premier in London and it was truley amazing, so i saw it again at a cinema nearer home, and it was amazing again. Definitly worth seeing, htis film is a legend, and should be awarded oscars (although it properly won't because the american film associastion is really annoying and will probably give it to something rubbish like ""Chicago II"" which hasn't be made but is a good example)The gore is vabulous, Lucy's death is brilliant, (i won't tell you how...) and so is her life, which is potrayed in anime (the japenese cartoon) and is truley great.have fun...Tarantino, your a genius, your best work yet."	5.0	Kill-Bill: Possibly Tarantino's finest yet??	2003-10-24	3	1	2

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AIFXFHO2N9WJB	"Justice0309 ""Justice"""	"In 2004, Hollywood was full of controversy, from the Bush-bashing film ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", directed by the gelatinous Michael Moore; to Mel Gibson's Biblically accurate epic ""The Passion of the Christ""; to the ultra-violent ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" and ""Kill Bill Volume 2"" from cult favorite director Quentin Tarentino.  Even though all of these films were controversial in the public and media's eyes, though who really cares about anything Michael Moore does, and personally Mel Gibson's movie was not controversial for any reason, that is unless you don't believe in God.  The only film(s) that was controversial to me was Quentin Tarentino's ultra-violent, `Kill Bill' 2-part series.  Initially the movies were intended to be just one long film, except after test audiences felt the movie was too long after clocking in at around 4 1/2 hours, director Quentin Tarentino felt it best to break them apart into 2 films.  This decision was probably wise for two reasons, one is that audiences wouldn't grow tired of sitting, and second, it allowed for more money to be made off of this new franchise.""Kill Bill Volume 1"" begins the story of vengeful character known as, `The Bride' (Uma Thurman).  During her wedding rehearsal `The Bride' and her husband-to-be are going through the motions of the wedding when a team of assassins enters the small church and slaughters everyone in sight.  The slaughter, was ordered by the leader of the assassins, a man named Bill (David Carradine), who just so happens to be the former lover and mentor to `The Bride'.  After surviving the slaughter and awaking from a long coma, `The Bride' begins her quest for vengeance, by killing every member of the assassin squad, until she reaches their leader and gets the opportunity to `Kill Bill'.As I said, out of the big three movies of 2004, the `Kill Bill' series were the only controversial ones, and that was only because of how unapologetically violent and depraved they were.  Truthfully, all the people who were upset over the violence in ""The Passion of the Christ"", but were ok with the violence of ""Kill Bill Volume 1"", need to have their heads examined.  In ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" the violence is the only thing propelling the story forward, truthfully there isn't much of anything compelling in the basic plot of the film to drive this movie at all.  Whereas, in ""The Passion of the Christ"" the violence, though realistic compared to `Kill Bill's' over-the-top bloodshed, is not the main focus of the movie.  The main focus is Christ's final 12 hours on Earth, and what He went through to redeem humanity from itself and the love He had for all of us, instead of the mindless, quest for vengeance with elaborate death scenes that was featured in the popular phenomenon that I will never understand, that is ""Kill Bill Volume 1"".As a whole, the movie ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" was ok, it wasn't terrific, and truthfully I don't see what all of the fuss over it being one of the greatest movies of all time is all about.  But even with my gripes aside, I have to admit the acting was great, the story was somewhat weak, but the actors all made it work for them, which helped tremendously.  The action was energetic and entertaining to watch, but was over-the-top and somewhat redundant in places.  I must qualify these statements though, I am not a real big fan of Quentin Tarentino's work, I thought ""Reservoir Dogs"" was good, but I wasn't impressed with ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Jackie Brown"".  If you are a fan of Tarentino then you will probably enjoy ""Kill Bill Volume 1"", and more than likely will be among the many that felt it was one of the best movies ever made.Overall, ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" isn't the greatest movie, but it's not the worst either.  It's at least worth seeing both ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" and ""Kill Bill Volume 2"" one time.""Kill Bill Volume 1"" is rated R for violence, language, and sensuality."	3.0	Hell Hath No Fury Like a Woman Scorned...	2005-10-11	6	0	6

The Bride (Uma Thurman) was a part of a gang of international assassins called the DiVAS (the Deadly Vipers Assassination Squad), whose teammates were Vernita Green, O-Ren Ishii, Elle Driver, and Budd (played by Vivica A. Fox, Lucy Liu, Daryl Hannah, and Michael Madsen, respectively.) They are led by Bill (David Carradine, never seen, only heard).The writing is excellent (as always), the dialogue exchange between The Bride and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox is wonderful in the brief screen time she has) is razor-sharp. The choice of opening credits music is absolutely perfect; it fits the mood of the film thus far very, very well. I love a good action movie, but they are usually brainless fluff pieces with buff men blowing things up left and right. But I got a serious kick out of an intelligent film where the hero was a heroine. Uma Thurman is pitch perfect in creating The Bride to be as real a person as possible. She is running away from a violent past, but it caught up to her. Now, they all have hell to pay. The scene in the hospital after she realizes what's been taken from her consists mostly of silence, then screaming sobs. Its pretty heart-wrenching stuff. The soundtrack to the whole movie fits like a glove. Pieces from spaghetti Westerns, old disco music, cues from classic film scores, all of it works perfectly in the film (""Twisted Nerve"" works especially well in showing a possible demise of our heroine).The whole movie bounces back and forth through time. For those who don't like this type of storytelling, abandon this page and look for something more linear. It shows the past, then the future, then the past, then the present. She has all her victims on a list and checks them off one by one (only two are picked off in this half) as she treks across the globe to get to them. Lucy Liu is absolutely poisonous as O-Ren Ishii. And Elle...well, let's leave evaluating Elle for a review of Volume 2. In-jokes abound, as many references as Tarantino could fit into the film, incredibly choreographed fight scenes (the House of Blue Leave sequence will leave you breathless), and just the fact that they made samurai swords cool again all add up to one of the best films ever made. And its all, essentially, from very small pieces of other cheesy films. Taking the best of the worst can create the best of the best. The Bride takes out the worst of the worst and eventually rampages on to become a pop culture icon for the new millennium. Admit it, girls....even guys, you know you wanted to be The Bride for just 10 minutes."	5.0	One of Tarantino's Best (of the few that he's made)	2004-11-11	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2EERM752BMSQD	just some guy	Strange how Quentin's superb film-play style has improved, but the substance and dialogue he's known for has degraded. This is a classic case of style over substance, and I truly think even the biggest fans of this movie will first talk about how great the scenes looked and how the camera work was dashing. No one can doubt this movie has pinache! But when it comes to interesting plot and well-written dialogue, this movie comes up short. Seems there's a big &quot;hate it or love it&quot; thing going on with this film. But I didn't hate it, but I surely didn't love it. I'm giving it 3 stars because at first I was genuinely interested in what was happening, and I really DID love the style and variations in visuals. But when the movie was about half over, I realized we weren't going to get any more depth, and the movie turned into just one big mess of fights after fights. And I thought the &quot;Matrix: Reloaded&quot; fights were boring! Once Uma confronted another enemy, I groaned: &quot;Not again!&quot; Fight, punch, kick, slice, move and swirl, exaggerated blood gushing, and...repeat! Well, glad I watched it, and I'll watch the 2nd Volume (I hear it's better), but it's not good enough to watch again.	3.0	punch, kick, slice, swirl...sigh...	2004-04-24	4	4	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1MF8M8OY3XLKT	"Karate Girl ""Lexi"""	"I guess I love this movie 'cause I love the martial arts and sword fighting. But really, the storyline is very entertaining also. It is the story of a woman assasin who, basically, gets revenge. She was beaten and put in a coma for four years on her wedding day in El Paso, Texas and had everyone in the wedding close to her (family and husband) killed by a group she was once a part of called the Deadly Viper Assasination Squad.She awakes once again four years later from the coma and seeks revenge on the DVAS. The opening scene is very graphic in black and white and shows her getting shot in the head by a man in which we do not see the face of named Bill until the second movie. (Bill is kind of the leader of the assasins and the one she mostly wants to kill). To shorten this up a little more, we first see her battle an old assasin code named Vernita Green; she kills her in front of her daughter without knowing it. We then see that she then awakes from the coma and gets back to her car after killing a guy named Buck who was a friend of Bill's at a hospital. She then gets back to her car and as she tries to move all her toes to make her legs stable again.We then learn about Oren Ishii, a half Japanese half American woman code named Cottonmouth from the squad, and how she became an assasin, and also one of the best. Oren's my favorite :). She then flies to Okinawa and meets Hattori Hanzo in a cafe, saying she has vermin to kill and needs Japanese steel. A month later, Hanzo creates his best sword he has ever made and gives it to her. Then we meet Oren's own clan in Japan, with frightening, intimidating characters such as Gogo, a seventeen year old crazy girl, Johnny Mo, leader of Oren's army the Crazy 88, and Sophie Fatale, who really is not intimidating or frightening but took part in the cruel beatings of the Bride (who's real name is revealed in the second movie).Then, the best part of the movie comes. The Bride arrives at a really cool restuarant/club place called the House of Blue Leaves where Oren and her top members are partying. She then, after a very dramatic part in which Sophie's arm is cut off, battles and de-limbs and kills all 88 of the Crazy 88 and more. ""But leave the limbs you lost...they belong to me now""-a great line from the movie.Then she battles Oren in the pretty scenery out in the back of the House of Blue Leaves, a very, very serious and dramtatic and great part. But of course I'm not giving away the ending! All I can say is this is one of my fave movies and it is sooooooooo cool.If you cannot handle very graphic blood in almost every scene and I MEAN THIS IS REALLY REALLY BLOODY I AM WARNING YOU, then do not see this. If you do not like seeing women or young girls in pain do not see this. There is a very graphic anime scene, so if you cannot take that stuff it won't appeal to you. There is some language, too, that shouldn't be heard by nine year olds, lol. Other than that, if you can handle all that, you can watch this and you'll like it.For all the people complaining about the blood, did you not see the box in which it depicted a woman with a sword? THE BLOOD IS SUPPOSED TO ADD DRAMA AND MORE REALITY. If someone gets their limbs cut off, there's going to be a whole lot of blood.And to the people who are complaining about how ""it's so unrealistic that she can possibly kill 88 and more people without dying"" although I do agree it's not likely IT IS A MOVIE and some are realistic and some are not, but this one mostly is.Overall, five stars. I'm actually thirteen but I was allowed to see this movie 'cause I'm pretty mature. When I first saw this, I wasn't sure if I really liked it either. I had never seen a movie with so much blood and gore before, but after I watched it again, I realized it was a very clever movie and behind the blood was an amazing story.This IS a good movie if you can handle it.You have to see it!"	5.0	This Movie is So Awesome!	2005-12-06	5	3	2

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3V9NF4B3CAM3P	Karl Becker	The movie is a joyride of pure action-packed wonderment, with blood on-screen measured in gallons per second.  Uma Thurman has never looked better, as does most of the rest of the cast.  Beautifully shot and lit.This DVD kind of falls through, however; the quality of sound and video is just fine, but there's essentially nil for extras.  Trailers for other Tarantino films, and some very throwaway videos for the musical group playing at the beginning of the hotel scene.With all the extras on Reservoir Dogs, I expect more of Tarantino.  Wait for a special edition of the film, hopefully containing both volumes packaged together.  If you liked the first one, you'll probably dig the second... though a three-hour long cut with the two movies together would be ideal.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AIIR8E34EDKCQ	- Kasia S.	After the first thirty minutes, of shock and gore, I found myself sinking in to the story! I have been waititng for it for months (Quentin started writing  this story in 1994 after Pulp Fiction) since i found about it on the internet.Uma Thurman plays Black Mamba who has a score to settle with her old friends who turned on her. She is great in it, in her yellow biker suit ( worn by Bruce Lee in one of his older movies) literally flyig in the air and doing some of the most unbelievable figting sequences possible. I have never though of Uma as tha t kind of actress, but she does it so well here, I couldnt help but root for her.I think my mouth was open through out the whole movie, it was that good, and with the crazy 70's inspired soundtrack and some great  music fetaured in the trailers by Tomoyasu Hotei, this is a must see, cant wait for the DVD.If u like whacky characters dressed in awesome costumes, beautiful scenery (Uma's duel with Lucy Liu takes plae in a serene japanese Garden with snow falling is amazing!) and most important blood spilling everywhere, severed limbs and head flying, assasins spiralling through air, this is a major gem in the movie world, one of my favorite movies ever, for sure.	5.0	Wicked fun!!!!!!!!	2003-10-10	2	0	2

Kill Bill is Quentin's 4th movie and it really is a piece of work. I can kind of understand why he cut it into 2 movies. Both volumes as one movie would not work too well for people who don't have any patience and since it is the majority of the population, it's totally understandable. This movie is so violent and the violence in mostly onscreen unlike Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Bottom line is that if you are expecting a Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction or Jackie Brown, you won't like this movie. This is something totally different for Tarantino.

My only dissapontment is that there wasn't a lot of Michael Madsen ( Mr. Blonde from Reservoir) but thats what the next movie is for hehe.No regrets mango check out this flick	5.0	Quentin in all his glory	2003-10-25	1	0	1

The use of anime was a great bonus and made the movie have such a different feel from anything else out there.  You'll recognize so many genres on this DVD, your head will spin, especially if you were a teenager in the 70's. Uma is at her best--looking all angles and curves as she goes for her prey. The supporting cast is a blast and the sound track, groovy as usual. I didn't even find the gore a problem at all. Somehow it's over-the-top 'pop' gave everything such a surreal quality that my eyes stayed open. I waited for this to come on DVD but really should have seen it on the big screen.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A30YM3J14K78RW	"Keith ""Keith"""	Quentin Tarantino's ode to martial arts films is for true martial arts fans. He kept it very close to the movies of the 70s, those that came out after the untimely death of Bruce Lee. At least that's as far back as I can remember. He even had the music and coming attractions themes of that era.The one problem I had with the film was the spraying blood scenes. While it was probably done in keeping with the traditional martial arts films he was portraying, I think he should have left that relic out.I thoroughly enjoyed all the characters, even those with minor roles like the master sword maker, played by the legendary Sonny Chiba. It would have been nice to see him wield a sword instead only making them.Uma Thurman was okay as a martial artist, but I have to wonder if they took the proper amount of time training her for the action. Or perhaps it was the fight scene choreographer. I don't know but it could have been better. It could have been and should have been spectacular as a matter of fact, but sadly it wasn't.To get a better idea of what I mean, view the 2nd Matrix picture and watch Keanu Reeves' work as a martial artist. Upon viewing his fluidity, his timing, and his flexibility, one can only imagine the work he put in to be so authentic on screen. Much of the credit goes to the fight choreographer who came up with the sequences in the first place.To be fair to women, take a look at Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and see how well the women perform the art in that picture. My point is this: If Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang were able to do it well, there's no reason why Uma couldn't have done equally as well. Perhaps they had a very tight shooting schedule. I don't know, but to me, why bother with the fight sequences if it wasn't going to look great on screen?Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the film. But, I love Tarantino's films so I may be a bit biased in this review.	4.0	Action Packed!	2005-02-25	3	0	3
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AQNUJV6QY4X3I	Keith W. Jones	As a hard-line, right-wing, ultra-conservative, gun-toting klansman, I expected that I would find this film to my liking. However, upon viewing this film, my thoughts regarding the perverse liberal mores of today were merely confirmed. It becomes evident, quite clearly, that Quentin Tarantino is a Democrat, something which I find quite unacceptable. I was highly disgusted by the utter lack of violence in this film, but was somewhat pleased by it. His political stances are evident, if not elucidated to a great extent, in this film. Take for example the particular scene in which the woman decides to attack the other woman; only a tree-hugging liberal would contrive such a lascivious scene. In summation, however, I would recommend this film, as it is highly entertaining and a delight for the entire family. By the way, I haven't taken a shower today.	1.0	An Abhorrent Film Indicative of Current Moral Decay	2004-05-21	7	0	7
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1XXBVRRNGBG5Y	kendall lopere	I've always felt a certain degree of ambivalence toward Tarantino and his films (can you separate the man from his art?). In interviews he comes across poorly, and his films, while superficially entertaining, seem to be designed to appeal to one specific viewer, himself.  However I'd heard such good things about Kill Bill that i felt obliged to see it, and I have to say I'm still somewhat underwhelmed.Bits of the movie and fantastic, hilarious and beautiful - the final scenes in the snowy garden are just breathtaking, the kid bursting in on the mother's knife fight - genius.  But too much of the movie is, well, boring beyond belief.  I enjoy a gore-filled romp as much as the next person, but I also believe in suspense and antici...pation.  This movie eschews these pleasures to indulge a fantastically outrageous bloodlust, but really, as pretty as Thurman might be, to watch her spank all those henchmen to get to Lucy Liu is tedious and, after a while, merely predictable.The genre changes were also interesting (&quot;Everyone steals from everyone else&quot;- Swingers), but I don't really feel they added anything, merely indulged tarantino's already inflated sense of his own brilliance.  It's not that ground breaking - James Joyce did the same thing in Ulysses almost a century ago - and it merely gives the movie a disjointed, incoherent feel that, combined with the already fractured narrative, disassociates the viewer from the on-screen action.My final complaint is also somewhat structural - namely the selective application of the laws of physics. Great movie have been made in alternate realities where the laws of physics don't apply and people can fly and run up walls (Crouching Tiger, Bulletproof Monk, The Matrix), but i've never seen one before where the laws work occasionally.  They apply merrily here until the final big rumble-in-the-restaurant scene, where all of a sudden people start leaping huge distances. &quot;It's a pastiche, It's an homage&quot;...no, it's lazy and it's boring.Tarantino needs to get less involves with himself and his ability and the things that he liked as a kid and get back to making genuinely artistic, ground breaking, challenging movies again.  Then perhaps he'll be worth the plaudits afforded to him...	3.0	Entertaining but unsatisfying	2004-06-25	2	1	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2PXHFGJZBNLXB	Kenji Fujishima	"Though I basically disagree with a previous online reviewer calling the movie ""sickness as art,"" he does have a point about one important thing: this movie---at least, this installment of the two-part KILL BILL epic---is trash. Pure trash. There is absolutely no depth to any of the characters in this movie, and certainly there is no psychological depth to the plot whatsoever, which is basically a one-dimensional revenge melodrama with a lot of violence and (admittedly gratuitous) gore. Indeed, Mr. Feuless is absolutely right when he says this movie isn't art. I admit it readily: it isn't.But then, it never really aspires to be, and it is on its rather lowbrow terms that this movie really should be evaluated. KILL BILL VOL. 1 is basically a superior action revenge flick written and executed with exhilarating high style by the trash-movie connoisseur Quentin Tarantino. It takes a predictable revenge plot---vengeful former assassin is gunned down by four members of her old squad, and after awaking from a long coma she musters up enough energy to go after those who wrong her---and proceeds to imbue the shallow, near-nonexistent plot with all the flourishes Tarantino can dream up, as he indulges in fancy camera shots, witty dialogue, stylized ultra-violence, and even an anime flashback sequence that hardly seems out of place in this particular movie. Sure, it mostly borrows and playfully quotes a lot of old kungfu movies from the '70s (it even uses the theme of the old ""Green Hornet"" TV show at one point)...but, of course, that is Tarantino's creative calling card. (It also isn't the usual Quentin Tarantino PULP FICTION-style dialogue-driven movie, but those who expect the same kind of self-conscious talky movie from him every time he makes one should really try to be a little more openminded about the director's attempts to do new films in different styles---it's probably why JACKIE BROWN seemed to get the bum's rush from a lot of people when it was released in 1997.) His sheer unbridled enthusiasm for the history of cinema is just plain infectious, and that energy carries you through KILL BILL VOL. 1. It is purely and unabashedly what it is---a trashy but brilliantly stylish revenge flick---and since Tarantino, at least in this first offering, clearly never aspires it to be anything more than that, one can confidently say that KILL BILL VOL. 1 succeeds magnificently on its own terms---arguably a modern genre classic. Nothing more, nothing less. And apparently not for all tastes, if you have a weak stomach for graphic (but highly exaggerated and surreal) violence and have strong moral values when it comes to the cinema. For the rest of us (and I'm sure Mr. Feuless would probably apply adjectives like ""barbarian"" and ""philistine"" for the rest of us), this movie is recommended."	5.0	Pure trash, but brilliantly executed	2004-08-17	5	3	2

Secondly, don't expect this to be anything other than a ""grindhouse"" movie (read all of the reviews here that don't like the ""cheap"" aspect,etc).  If you go into this film with those expectations (a hard thing for the American film-going public to do these days) then you are in for a treat.  This is a modern masterpiece by anyone's standards.  The film is essentially a film about women, or one woman to be exact, and her revenge on one man and his cronies.  My wife, who happened to not like the gore a lot, thought it was the best role written for a woman since ""Gone With the Wind"".  That is saying a lot, but Quentin and Uma (""Q and U"" in the credits) have done just that.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2MYGSWZ9UG1Y0	Kestrel	I, personally, very much enjoyed this movie. However, there were times where I wondered whether I was watching a movie, or simply watching violence erupt on screen. This movie was definately filled with action, high paced, as well as slower paced suspence. The unfortunate thing is that is seems that for all the action, there is very little of the story.Overall, it was a high-quality movie, but if you're looking for something with a good, strong storyline, you may want to look elsewhere.	3.0	Lovely, but a bit too violent for many palates.	2004-06-02	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3V54XSSZUMDCK	K. Evans	After reading the other reviews, good and bad, I just decided to chime in with my two cents.To be quite honest, I love this movie. Tarantino must have had an amazing time making it, and that shows up in the final product. It's just fun to watch. It introduces those of us who aren't very familiar with the kung-fu genre to it and makes us want to go watch a bunch of them. Volume 2 does the same with spaghetti westerns. These movies are like a crash course in Grindhouse-type cinema. I noticed one reviewer who negatively critiqued the film commented on the black and white photography during the fight scene-Quentin had to do that to get it past the MPAA; the Japanese version is all color. Anyway, the movie was a blast, and if you can stop being a snooty cinephile for about 2 hours, you should have a blast too.	5.0	Love it or Hate it - I just happen to love it!	2007-06-07	4	3	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1PILMASEE483C	"kevh015 ""Kevin"""	Tarantino.  He is probably one of the best directors in my opinion.  I really enjoy his movies and was very dissapointed after seeing Kill Bill.  I did not enjoy anything about this movie.  I hate to give Tarantino a bad review cause I enjoy other movies by him so much but man this was a dissapointment.  I can not be entertained by a girl (whose acting i did not think was very good at all) trying to kill a terrible chinese actor.  I liked the weapons but the fight scenes were terrible.  Its ok to have blood squirting out of arms back in the day when Monty Python was making movies but it really made the movie decrease at least two stars.  I thought the plot was a bit childish and the fact that she killed all the men was just stupid.  I did this with my GI Joes and MicroMachines back when i was 5 years old.  I would have to say that this movie is Tarantinos worst.  Sorry to all Tarantino fans for rating this movie bad but i think the only way any one over the age 12 would enjoy this movie is only because they like the director.  Tarantino you are amazing but i can't say anything good about this movie accept that i liked the weapons and the director.  Thats it, sorry to all you Tarantion fans.	2.0	I wouldn't watch again	2005-03-14	14	3	11

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A37JKM7EFD0DIQ	K.H.	Quetin Taratino's much anticipated movie, &quot;&quot;Kill Bill&quot; is a camp, yet serious retro look at the martial arts flicks, particularly of the Japanese origins, with some Hong Kong Shaw Brothers and spaghetti western themes intertwined, to mesh a highly entertaining movie, even though it is, like its predecessors, a little over the top.That is what makes this movie, though violent, even more entertaining, that the violence, with the blood splurting at outrages heights, is not gross nor gratuitous, revealing a smart sense of proportion. Uma (not one of my favorite actresses) is actually very good as the movies heroine.Actually, in Vol. 1, Taratino has been able to take many of the actors I have not thought were very good at their craft and draw out solid performances. Further, he has held wire-tricks to a minimum, which is a great relief. Although unrealistic, these fight scenes are tough yet beautiful, another balance.So with such high praise, why not five stars? Well, Taratino does what he normally does - uses similar patterns he has used in his previous movies, while mainstream critics seem to be enamored, I think it reflects more like a Thomas Kincade painting - sure it is nice- but I can only take so much of the same thing.  Furthermore, while his use of violence is balanced, his use of dialogue is prone to too much vulgarity which lacks memorable phrases or proper emotional climaxes.With the minor negatives aside, it would be five stars instead of four if it had not been halted in mid-stream.  This is not Taratino's fault, for his vision was to release vol 1 and 2 as one movie, but the studio's and producers, wanting more of a commercial success, divided it into two flicks. Even though it is not Taratino's fault, this movie should not have ended when it did and lacks punch because of it. After all, it represents many genres that very seldom split one movie into two seprate films.Lastly, while I love this movie, I wish there would have been more &quot;extras&quot; that are now so common with DVDs. I suspect, and probably ofr a reason, that when Vol. 2 comes out, there will be more featurettes that we the viewer can enjoy.  I liked this movie even more the second.	4.0	Great Movie Now on DVD	2004-04-14	3	2	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1H5KNQ61FFCX2	"khuddle ""khuddle"""	Kind of a letdown from the guy who brought us Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds. The violencein this movie is the most graphic in a Tarantino movie yet, and for the most part totally gratuitous --as violent a movie as Pulp Fiction was, you always felt there was some reason or justifcation behind it.Not in this flick. At times, it almost seems a celebration of violence, and in that sense it is quite off-putting.The films has a few bright spots -- there are the usual Tarantino twists and surprises that keepyou intrigued; Uma Thurman gives a really strong performance in the lead; but it is Lucy Liu who reallyimpresses, stealing the show as a ruthless assassin who becomes the head of a Yakuza gang in Japan.I would recommend at least a single viewing of this movie to see Thurman and especially Liu's strong performances.But only the most rabid of Tarantino fans will want to watch it more than once.	3.0	Worth a rental	2011-08-26	2	0	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	The pregnant Bride aka Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) was brutalized and shot in the head by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad lead by Bill during her wedding ceremony.  Everyone in the wedding party was callously murdered with professional precision.  Four years later the Bride awakens from her nightmarish comatose sleep with a revengeful mind-set.  Disturbed and vengeful the Bride sets out to find the members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad in order to end their lives as she attempts to find closure to her tragic loss.Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is a well-written and spectacular cinematic event with a kaleidoscope of martial arts and other cinematic film nostalgia.  The cinematic nostalgia of spaghetti westerns, exploitation cinema, and martial art movies are deliberately inserted as homage by Tarantino.  These scenes are meticulously organized and cared for as Tarantino wants the audience to have a superb experience while viewing the film.  An example is the sampling of the music from the Gypsy Kings set to samurai sword fights in a Japanese garden, which works like magic.  The excellent cast performs extremely well under both physically strenuous scenes and daily dialogues.  An interesting side note to the casting of Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is Tarantino's use of the character Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba), which is a distant relative several generations from the same character in a Japanese TV-series.  Throughout the film the cinematography is breathtaking as the camera flows and pans with the characters with effortless brilliance.  It is apparent when viewing Kill Bill: Vol. 1 that this film is made by a film lover who wants to share his love and interest for movies and smoothly enlighten the audience in the magical properties of cinema.	5.0	Tarantino's Kill Bill: A Film Lovers Masterpiece	2004-04-22	6	4	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A356TJCTCLDN89	Kimberley Wilson	Sometimes you just have ignore the reivewers and watch a movie for yourself. When Kill Bill came out some critics were hysterical in their denunciation of it. I walked into the theater expecting to see something that would send me fleeing back down the aisle, instead I saw a pretty good action flick.Should you let your children see Kill Bill? No. I'm not even going to elaborate on why. Should you see it if you are phobic about male nurses? Probably not. Is it shocking? Only if you have never seen a Japanese or Hong Kong grindhouse movie before. Is Quentin Tarantino the most evil man in movies today? Oh please! Not by a long shot.You already know the plot so I'll talk about what I really loved in this movie. Uma Thurman's character of The Bride is implacable. Her baby is gone, the young man she was to marry is dead and she will have revenge or die trying. I was reminded of the movie Hannie Caulder (from the 70s) or The Bride Wore Black(from the 50s? and The Bride With White Hair (80s). Female revenge movies are not new. This movie just raises the theme to glory.The first fight with Vernita was fantastic and it also raised questions that hopefully will be answered in Kill Bill part II. Vernita is living in  a suburb, teaches Little League and has a nice, unaware husband.In other words, she appears to be retired and living a normal life so why was The Bride punished so harshly for apparantly wanted to do the same thing? I'm looking forward to finding out.The Oren Ishi back story is done in classic anime and is darn clever. The gorgeous--yes goregous final show down between her and The Bride is filmed in a snowy courtyard. Why it's snowing when it certainly wasn't even winter when the Bride arrives on the scene doesn't matter. The music and the way the scene is arranged is a direct homage to Sergio Leone and Once Upon a Time in the West.A lot of people get killed in Kill Bill. Blood flows like water, limbs are lost and in the middle of all this there are extremely funny jokes and sight gags.  If you hesistated to see this movie before don't worry and see it for yourself. It's no worse than any other grindhouse movie and is a good deal wittier than most of the movies of 2003. Have fun.	4.0	watch it yourself	2004-01-11	3	1	2

Be that as it may, this movie was a hoot to watch and David Carridine looks terrific for his age, he must be pushing 70.  I never thought Uma was anything close to pretty, but she does have a certain vunerable toughness about her, so she was good in this role.  Who really blew me away was Daryl Hannah, I thought the fake nurse looked familiar but I couldn't place her until I read the credits and saw her name, she was excellent and unexpected.  She never had a part like this one, she should do more roles like this because she certainly shined in this movie.  I thought she deserved more attention.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2VUP5US1F5HG5	K. Jump	"Quentin Tarantino's latest peek into his deranged imagination is a triumph of style over substance that is every bit as frustrating as it is entertaining.  The plot--evidently based on the classic ""The Bride Wore Black""--is a simple revenge story hopped up on killer steroids.  Uma Thurman is an avenging angel on a mission to get even with the assassins who killed her husband and unborn child on her wedding day.  Highlighted by innumerable flights of cartoonish fancy, including thematic chapter cards, a near-camp 70's look and sound, one tongue-in-cheek line after the other, a wild anime segment, comic-book style live-action fights (you can almost see the WHAM! ZOWIE! and POW!'s), and an unending stream of surreal dismemberments and decapitations, ""Kill Bill"" is delightfully fun hokum. Unfortunately, the ending simply isn't there.  Sure, this is ""Volume 1"" but even series films have their own beginnings, middles, and endings.  But what are literary rules of drama to Tarantino?  Less than nothing, apparently.  This would have been a high-camp masterpiece if only it had a conclusion of SOME kind.  But nooo, instead it's a wild and crazy ride to ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE!"	3.0	THE MOTHER OF THE ANTI-CLIMAX	2003-10-12	4	1	3

I wanted to appreciate, heck, love this movie as much as most of the reviewers out there, but it just didn't happen.  This is the single emptiest, unsatisfying, pretentious, unredeeming pile of poser loaf in the history of cinema.Now I AM a fan of Tarantino.  The first movie I put in when I finally got the big screen TV and surround sound was ""Reservoir Dogs"".  I dragged friends to see ""Pulp Fiction"".  For a while he was pretty impressive. He's lost it in this one.I know, I know.  Everybody will point out  all the ""homages"" that Tarantino pays to the ""great"" martial arts action movies, and to the speghetti westerns, etc.  But when you blantantly steal a vibe or a scene, or even an outfit: pee on it, and make it meaningless, its not an homage, it's more like a desecration.  It's not creative and new, it's derivative and dead.  From the empty delivery of the intentionally hokey dialogue, to the cartoony wire-fu combat, to the puppety-looking sets and airline sequences, it plays more like a 60's batman episode.  For a few minutes I was almost ready to credit him with making a great action movie farce.  But it's too unmovingly violent, and too full of itself to even succeed as a satire.Tarantino does use some editing techniques that in a better movie, might've made a positive difference.  Here they have just the opposite effect; using the directors mastery of technical detail to mock his inability to construct a story.  Flash-backs, flash-forwards, flash-animations all stroll through the plot, not because they need to to tell the story, but because, hey, he's Quentin T, and if he want to clown-punch his way through a cinematic sequence then that's what he's gonna do.I guess the lesson here is that if you really want to, you can spend dozens of millions of dollars to make a crappy retread action movie when most production teams can do it for less than 8.Gaudy, empty, emotionally uninvolving, repetitive, derivative, schlocky, masturbatorily violent, and ultimately ineffective.If you buy the hype, then buy the movie.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1YNV00RDNWCZ7	Koza Roger Alan	The fourth Tarantino's movie is a pleasure to watch and a banality to think; Tarantino as a filmmaker has become a kind of a little genius, but think twice before you claim that he is a master of the medium. It's true that the five chapter of this first volume is almost a masterpiece for its own right. But again, a formal brilliance without any direction, it does not make Kill Bill a consistent movie. Formally prodigious and intellectually immature as its best, Kill Bill is a hollow exposition of vengeance as an interesting feeling which is cool enough to follow and portray in order to practice filmmaking. A nonlinear narrative in which we get to know how Uma the bride Thurman got angry is so irrelevant that nothing can't be said about it. Yes, we know that Tarantino is the father of the intertextuality, but he fails as usual to point out that textualitiy towards any social or human subject. A master, perhaps, at least if cinema is just a formal medium; nevertheless, a master without any originality (though honest) because Kill Bill is a juxtaposition of films that Tarantino love. Five chapter pays the price of your ticket, but I think it is a better choice to look for the films Tarantino love. If you watch, for instance, Seijun Suzuki'Pistol Opera. Takeshi Kitano' Sonatine, Kinji Fukasaku'Battle Royale, and Kin Hu' Come drink with me, you will learn that they master their medium, but they also have something to say. Tarantino shows, he is a show; an artist whose main subject is himself doesn't have anything to say.	3.0	A teenager master in his forties	2003-12-05	4	4	0

Alas, one commentary and some trailers. Sigh...This film is still an awesome tale of revenge, with Uma Thurman as the Bride, who awakens from a coma and begins visciously and methodically taking out her former co-DiVAS. The anime sequence, telling us of the childhood suffering of O-ren Ishii is even more spectacular than in the theater! The special effects are top-notch, even the sounds of the swords, and are more cartoonish than gory. It is truly the little things that make this a unique film, including a soundtrack produced by the RZA.I can't wait to see the second installment, hopefully it gets a better DVD treatment when the time comes.	5.0	Lacking in bonus features, but still stellar!!	2004-04-18	1	1	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A136MAOWGCU2C2	K.T. May	I actually preferred Volume One because there was a lot more action in it. My favorite scene was when she fights the Crazy 88's, which is weird for me, because I don't usually like fight scenes. Plus the music in Volume 1 was far superior with the Tomoyasu Hotel and Nancy Sinatra and all that. The second one was pretty damn good, though, (although I still can't watch the beginning when she gets shot...eek...too real for me). The fight with Elle definitely kicked some serious arse and when she meets B.B. is heart-wrenching, but there was a lot of Quentin's trademark dialogue in it, which, IMO, was a little overdone, i.e. the wedding rehearsal. It all depends on which you prefer, I guess. But both movies were excellent and I can't wait for the DVD of extras to come out.	5.0	Excellent movie...	2004-10-08	4	3	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A16X61RLY1YJL7	"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid"""	Having watched &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; several years ago and not liking it too much, Quentin Tarantino's films weren't too prominent on my radar screen until this film came along.  I would have to say that &quot;Kill Bill Volume 1&quot; has raised my opinion of his film making talents quite significantly.  This film is one that defies all the norms in an action film for me in that normally, for me to consider an action/revenge film to be a very good one there has to still be a fairly decent plot behind it.  Don't get me wrong here, this film has a &quot;decent&quot; plot behind it, it's just not one of great depth in so much that it is merely, &quot;they tried to kill me, I lived, now it's time to hunt them down and kill them.&quot;  It is that unorthodox script that leans heavily on corny and campy dialogue that makes it that much more entertaining.  Fair warning to those weak in the stomach though as the film also relies on a heavy amount of unrealistic gore that might turn even the strongest of stomachs.Performance wise, Uma Thurman is perfect for this role, simply put, the tall and exceedingly beautiful blonde kicks some serious rear end in this film.  Other Tarantino favorites show up in this film such Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah and David Carradine, all performing extremely well in their respective roles.Also worth mentioning is the score/music for the film, primarily produced by &quot;The RZA.&quot;  Between the score and some of the music provided by a band of three Japanese women known as The 5, 6, 7, 8's, all combine to further enhance the experience of this film.The Premise:As stated above, the premise for this film is pretty straight forward; Uma Thurman plays &quot;The Bride or Black Mamba,&quot; a former member of the Viper hit squad that wanted out but they didn't want her to go so they attempted to kill her but she only ended up in a coma.  Four years later, she's out of the coma and she wants her revenge...  What follows from there is a great action flick that touches on several genres besides the revenge film that leans heavily on Japanese sword happy action flick.I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of films of this type and would also suggest it to those who, like me, might've passed on Tarantino films in the past; this film experience is well worth it.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-The Making of &quot;Kill Bill Vol. 1&quot;-Bonus Musical Performances by &quot;The 5, 6, 7, 8's&quot;-Quentin Tarantino Movie Trailers	5.0	Kill Bill Volume 1 - A film that defies the norms...	2004-05-10	1	0	1

With all the movies filled with martial arts violence already in existence I expected the usual, but Tarantino's synism and brutal wit threw the ordinary out the window.I was on the edge of my seat with a big grin watching Kill Bill. I loved how Uma's yellow outfit was the same as Bruce Lee's in 'Game of Death'. The plot was all it needed to be, revenge, it speaks for itself. I left the theater with the tingle. Lately that has only happened after the matrix movies.this is probably one of the funniest and most fun movies I've seen in a long time	5.0	A gift for Tarantino  fans.	2003-12-24	1	0	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ	Larry Scantlebury	"So, you're right. Is it art? I guess it must be. A lot of people think it's brilliant. Simply brilliant. Regrettably, I must be a moron because it seems to me like a lot of garbage.Two things cross my mind. Actually three. First, it's a chunky Alec Baldwin (come on man, YOU ARE brilliant. Red October; The Getaway(s). Lose the role, get the role) in Pearl Harbor saying to Ben Afleck regarding some story he told  . . . ""It's b*******, but it's extremely good b*******."" That's my first thought about Kill Bill.My second thought is that if you sculpted the Mona Lisa in Guda Cheese, some one somewhere (I gotta tell you I think it would be LA) will tell you 'it's fantastic. Fantabulous. Brilliant. Splendid. Really.' It's bad enough going to weddings in Ann Arbor where the poor parents have spent $15,000 on an ice sculpture of the Infant of Prague. But at least no one is saying it's art.The third thought I had is a comment made on TV about Janet Jackson and the ill fated wardrobe malfunction. And this person was saying that it was only a (insert gender specific body part here) and at least it wasn't decapitation and amputation.Wow. Obviously that person hadn't seen Kill Bill. Could there be a movie that would trivialize the first 25 minutes of Private Ryan? If there is one, it's Kill Bill. This movie gave new meaning to the 1940 'angry boss' movies when they would quip, 'heads will roll!'So, I apologize. There must be art here because it gets such rave reviews. Come on. It's junk. Makes Stallone sound like Olivier. 2 stars in lower case because Uma worked her (another body part) off and looked good doing it. Larry Scantlebury"	2.0	Quentin is one strange man!	2005-07-20	5	1	4

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	I missed &quot;Kill Bill, Volume 1&quot; when it was in the theaters (you have to move quickly up here in the Northland because we have only two movie theaters with a limited number of screens and films can disappear before you know it), but this turned out to be to my advantage.  Quentin Tarantino did not plan on &quot;Kill Bill&quot; being told in two &quot;volumes&quot; but Miramax decided that a four hour revenge film would be a bit much and consequently we end up with &quot;Volume 1&quot; coming out on DVD the same week &quot;Volume 2&quot; opens up in the theaters.  So having seen the Bride (Uma Thurman) take care of the first two names on her &quot;to do&quot; list I can treat tonight as an intermission and go see &quot;Volume 2&quot; tomorrow.  This is good because if I had to wait four months to see the second half of the film I would be pretty ticked off.Once upon a time in El Paso, Texas a wedding party is slaughtered execution style.  However, it turns out that the Bride, who is pregnant, is not dead but in a coma.  Four years later she wakes up in time to save herself from insult being added to her ingury.  After dealing with a few annoying details, such as somebody trying to rape her comatose body and being unable to get her legs to move, the Bride puts together her list of people to kill: (1) Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), (2) O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), (3) Budd (Michael Madsen), (4) Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and (5) Bill (David Carradine).  There is more that happens in this film than eliminating the first two list (and since there is a Volume 2 telling you that the Bride survives Volume 1 does not constitute a spoiler), such as an anime telling us how O-Ren Ishii became the Queen of the Tokyo underworld.  But Tarrantino is all about how the Bride takes out her first two victims and the triumph of style as substance, especially when style means fountains of blood gushing from human beings that would make Akira Kurosawa proud.You have to keep in mind that Tarantino has seen and committed to memory more movies than any other human being on the face of the planet.  The following is a list of movies and television series that are supposedly referenced in &quot;Kill Bill, Volume 1&quot;:&quot;The Lodger,&quot; &quot;Scaramouche,&quot; &quot;The Wings of Eagles,&quot; &quot;The Magnificent Seven,&quot; &quot;Yojimbo,&quot; &quot;Tsubaki Sanjr,&quot; &quot;The Manchurian Candidate,&quot; &quot;Marnie,&quot; &quot;Honey West,&quot; &quot;Tky nagaremono,&quot; &quot;I Lunghi giorni della vendetta,&quot; &quot;Da zui xia,&quot; &quot;Modesty Blaise,&quot; &quot;The Green Hornet,&quot; &quot;I Giorni dell'ira,&quot; &quot;Le Scandale,&quot; &quot;Ironside,&quot; &quot;Kyuketsuki Gokemidoro,&quot; &quot;Kurotokage,&quot; &quot;Da uomo a uom,&quot; &quot;La Mari&eacute;e &eacute;tait en noir,&quot; &quot;Twisted Nerve,&quot; &quot;C'era una volta il West,&quot; &quot;The Wild Bunch,&quot; &quot;Siu kuen wong,&quot; &quot;A Clockwork Orange,&quot; &quot;Hannie Caulder,&quot; &quot;Black Mama, White Mama,&quot; &quot;The Last House on the Left,&quot; &quot;La Novia ensangrentada,&quot; &quot;Il Grande duello,&quot; &quot;Joshuu sasori: Dai-41 zakkyo-b, &quot;Shurayukihime,&quot; &quot;The Doll Squad,&quot; &quot;Tian xia di yi quan,&quot; &quot;High Plains Drifter,&quot; &quot;White Lightning,&quot; &quot;Shura-yuki-hime: Urami Renga,&quot; &quot;Truck Turner,&quot; &quot;Uomini duri,&quot;  &quot;Crash che botte!,&quot; &quot;Onna hissatsu ken,&quot; &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds,&quot; &quot;Thriller - en grym film,&quot; &quot;Du bi quan wang da po xue di zi,&quot; &quot;Profondo rosso,&quot; &quot;Switchblade Sisters,&quot; &quot;Black Sunday,&quot; &quot;Eaten Alive,&quot; &quot;7 note in nero,&quot; &quot;Hao xia,&quot; &quot;Yagy ichizoku no inb,&quot; &quot;Game of Death ,&quot; &quot;Grease,&quot; &quot;Wu du,&quot; &quot;Patrick,&quot; &quot;Day of the Woman,&quot; &quot;Hattori Hanz: Kage no Gundan.&quot; &quot;Paura nella citt&agrave; dei morti viventi,&quot; &quot;Resurrection,&quot;  &quot;Shogun Assassin,&quot; &quot;Si wang ta,&quot; &quot;Makai tensh,&quot; &quot;Escape from New York,&quot; &quot;Xian si jue,&quot; &quot;Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan,&quot; &quot;Tenebre,&quot; &quot;The Professional: Golgo 13,&quot; &quot;Scarface,&quot; &quot;Gai shi ji hua,&quot; &quot;Year of the Dragon,&quot; &quot;Wong ga jin si,&quot; &quot;Hard to Kill,&quot; &quot;3-4x jugatsu,&quot; &quot;Miller's Crossing,&quot; &quot;Hong fen zhi zun,&quot; &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; &quot;Reservoir Dogs,&quot; &quot;Fong Shi Yu II: Wan fu mo di,&quot; &quot;Tai ji zhang san feng,&quot; &quot;True Romance,&quot; &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; &quot;Jbei ninpch,&quot; &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn,&quot; &quot;Full Tilt Boogie,&quot; &quot;Kite,&quot; &quot;Wei&szlig;kreuz,&quot; &quot;SF:Episode One,&quot; &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money,&quot; &quot;Proboscis,&quot; &quot;Wo hu cang long,&quot; &quot;Batoru rowaiaru,&quot; and &quot;Koroshiya 1.&quot;I was happy I recognized over two dozen of the films on that list, and that is not even close to a passing score percentage-wise.  For all I know every single scene and shot in the film is lifted from something else, but the onslaught of references is apparently so relentless that everything old becomes new again, especially without a commentary track when QT can tell us the origin of each and every homage.  At this point what is most memorable to me is watching O-Ren Ishii and her posse walk glide into the House of Blue Leaves with the soundtrack giving them energy and the final showdown in an exquisite garden at night with gently falling snow where O-Ren in her white kimono and the Bride in her yellow biker suit do their dance of death with Japanese steel.With &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; Tarantino made his impression upon our ears with scene after scene of great dialogue.  No wonder the soundtrack for that film had clips of some of what came rolling off the tongues of the actors (usually Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a corpse in this film).  But with &quot;Kill Bill, Volume 1&quot; Tarantino's blood feast is mostly for the eyes.  Imagine what he can do if he every puts those two together in a single film.  Until then, we can see how the Bride deals with the rest of the people on her list.  This film is not for everybody, but then what Quentin Tarantino film ever was?	5.0	Bang, Bang, Bill shot down the Bride...now she wants revenge	2004-04-19	7	5	2

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2IVASW9RVYNGQ	Lealing	Uma Thurman plays the unnamed heroine who is out to get revenge four years after being shot down and falling into a coma. Four years ago her fiance and friends were shot down in a chapel in Texas by the Deadly Viper Assasination Squad of which she used to belong. After remaining in a coma due to a shot in the head, she wakes up four years later and has a list of five names of people belonging to the Squad who she has decided to hunt down and kill. The list includes O Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Bud (Bill Madsen), Bill (David Carradine) and another which I have forgotten.A few months after her release from hospital she goes to the house of the fifth member of the Viper Squad and has wonderfully choreographed fight scene with her ending in a blade thrown at the viper member.Next the action goes to Japan where we learn the story of O Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) who lost her parents at a young age and got revenge for both their deaths even before she was a teen. She is now the head of the Yakuza, Japanese mafia. This part of the story was recounted in Japanese anime and worked really well. Next we see the powerful O Ren Ishii with her gang including a crazy Japanese schoolgirl who is her official bodyguard and a half French/half Japanese assistant played by the gorgeous Julie Dreyfuss together with a whole bunch of men dressed in black suits. The action moves to a Japanese restaurant where our heroine has tracked down O Ren Ishii but must fight like a 100 Yakuzas. Lots of limb chopping here and blood spurting verging on the ridiculous and which I found rather comical. After killing or maiming most of the 100 men in black suits our heroine finally gets to fight O Ren Ishii which I found to be rather disppointing. More staring each other out rather than real fighting. Of course, we can guess who wins the fight. You'll have to watch Volume 2 to see Uma hunt down the remaining three on her list.I enjoyed the film even though it is a rehash of many Hong Kong Kung Fu movies. There was a lot of attention to detail which even included an opening title with the Shaw Brothers. The switch from black and white and then to colour was most effective and the fights scenes although not as good as the original HK KUng Fu movies manage to hold their own. But beware of the amount of blood this film shows if you are on the sensitive side but I personally found the blood squirting scenes more funny rather than gory as they were definitely overdone (deliberately).Lealing	4.0	Bloody revenge film	2004-06-17	3	1	2

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3MLO4GAD2O9DL	"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy"""	"Asian cinema is the primary influence in ""The Fourth Film by Quentin Tarantino"".  Samurai swords, martial arts, and anime figure prominently and even when they don't, Mr. T. is feeling his Asian oats in both the handling of the main theme and the hyper-stylized bloodiness that spews all over the place a whole bunch of the time.  Japanese culture--honor, revenge, and all that good stuff--and Hong Kong action fuse in Kill Bill, along with the pop-savvy auteur's encyclopedic command of pulpy cinema, spanning the globe from Japan to Italy to the U.S. and back again.Character development?  Not really.  Plot drives this baby, and Mr. T. knows that cinema this character-thin has to pile on the plot-driven glitz to keep the viewer's attention.  Uma Thurman, the Bride, is violently assaulted on her wedding day and left for dead, but isn't.  She vows revenge on all those who've done her wrong and makes good on her promise.  That's the plot.Along the way, we're treated to a finger-snapping mix of 60s and 70s film soundtrack and pop music, and an equally ever-kinetic brew of the multiple forms that video takes to evoke instantaneous reactions.  These include Japanese anime, way over the top chop-socky battles, and intense-to-the-point-of-complete-wackiness ""emotion"".  If somebody has to die, they do it as violently as possible. If somebody feels something, they feel it so it hurts like nothing else in the entire world.This is how cartoons operate and while this is an exceedingly entertaining cartoon, it is, nevertheless, a cartoon.  A cartoon exists to elicit one simple, basic response at a time, with no requirement for depth of understanding.  It's interesting to contrast this with Mystic River, Clint Eastwood's breathtaking work of violence and family.  Both films have revenge as a core theme.  The difference is remarkable.What's also interesting is to compare this film with Reservoir Dogs in which characters evolved from the plot gradually, credibly, and powerfully.  In Kill Bill, whatever characters there are exist only to make the writer-director's cartoon vision come to life.  Characters don't really change as the film progresses.  They can't--each one exists to address a specific function and once that function is fulfilled, the character either dies or keeps doing the same thing he or she was doing before, whether it's kill people, make swords, or just be a general pain in the butt.  And that, Mr. T. says, is the whole point.Tarantino is the master of pop fusion; he does it better than anyone else.  In Kill Bill, he's upped his own pop fusion ante to a level at which glitz reigns supreme."	3.0	Redefining the cartoon.  And other audio/video bytes...	2003-11-06	4	1	3
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3BG1VYB8STWP2	"Life Enthusiast ""Joseph"""	"This was one of my favorite films of 2003.  Tarantino is a genious writer/director and his fourth film is by no means a let down.Kill Bill Vol. 1 opens in a wedding chapel with a bloody dialouge between a  brutally beaten pregnant woman known only as ""the Bride"" and her associate, the notorious Bill.  He puts a bullet in her head and leaves her to die, but of coarse, she lives.  Comatose for four years, she awakes with receding memories of what happened.  Uma Thurman gives a wonderful performance when conveying both the Bride's sadness and ultimate fury upon learning of the loss of her baby.  She escapes the hospital and heads for Japan.  There, master sword craftsman Hattori Hanzo makes for her the ultimate weapon of death.And so, sword in tow, she makes a list that she calls ""The Death List Five"" - including the names of her 5 former coworkers, all of them part of the assassin coup known as The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS).  These are the same people who showed up unexpetedly on her wedding day, the ones responsibe for the bloody carnage and the murder of her unborn baby - and now, it's time for her to exact revenge.  She numbers them in order of her anger, saving the top cats for last:1) O-Ren Ishii (aka Cottonmouth) - Queen of the Japanese underworld of crime.  (Portrayed in a show-stealing performance by Lucy Lui)2) Vernita Green (aka Copperhead) - A vicious woman, once one of Bill's most ruthless assassins, she is now a stay-at-home mother, married to a doctor in Pasadena, CA.3) Budd (aka Sidewinder) - Budd is the enigma in this film.  Not much of his identity is revealed.4) Elle Driver (aka California Mountain Snake) - A one-eyed sociopathic killer, she is Bill's deadliest assassin and, second to Bill, the person the Bride wants a piece of the most.  In the wake of the Bride's four year slumber, she is currently Bill's lover.5) Bill - In this film, Bill is the man without of face.  Never shown, we know only that he the Bride's former boss and is responsibe for her attempted murder.Now, mind you, many people argue that this film doesn't have a plot.  But in a way, that's the beauty of it.  This films proposes many questions (thus Volume 1), and trust me, Volume 2 answers them all and then some.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3FUCO313YVBHV	Lightcash	"Say there is a question, how much blood is too much blood. The answer is ""when you feel sick"". That's what happened to me to certain degree when I was watching this movie. Actually, I like action, crime, violence movies (some movie databases recommend me this movie with my past reviews). I have watched many violent movies with brutal murders and all. But this one was above all of them.First, gist of the movie, Uma Thurman, who is pregnant, is beaten brutally and shot in the head by a group of people, somehow she survives. She recovers in the hospital to some degree, escapes from there. Now she is on rampage to take revenge. She gets Samurai training from a veteran of Japan as well. She kills few people and as Bill is the main villain, I guess he will be killed in part 2.Every fighting sequence is very bloody and sickening. Blood, slaughter,  body parts, deaths are ample. The fountain of the blood used several times (once in animation as well).The things I liked, cinematography, presentation, story pace, costumes, grip over audience and interesting chronological events jumble.To summarize, if you like action and ready for high dose of violence, you will enjoy this movie.The things I didn't like about the movie are, acute violence, mismatch of the action scenes with the characters and story (that's what I felt when I compared them, you can try that too, provided your mind allows you to think about the movie), very generic story, un-human stunts, scenes."	3.0	Watch only if you like gory violence	2005-07-09	5	0	5

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A17FLA8HQOFVIG	Linda Linguvic	Violent and brilliant, this is a Quentin Tarantino masterpiece.  It stars Uma Thurman as an assassin whose entire wedding party was murdered on her wedding day.  She's in a coma for four years but when she wakes up she's after revenge and so she begins to wreck havoc on everyone who was involved in the crime.  Basically, that's the plot line but this film is more than just a story.  It is a brilliant interpretation of the action-martial arts genre.  And it's so fast-paced and outrageous that I just sat there and admired the intricately choreographed sequences of violence.Blood flows, limbs fly and heads are chopped off.  This sounds gruesome but there is a comic book quality to it all.  In fact, there is one sequence where Tarantino makes good use of animation, which fits in perfectly with the story.I must admit though that after a while I did get a little bored.  There is one scene where Uma Thurman wipes out about fifty assassins and there was a bit of sameness to it all.  Also, I never identified or had any real sympathy for the characters.  But this film was never conceived to be about subtle emotions.  And so I must judge it for what it is.  And in spite of (or maybe because of) the blood and violence, it is definitely entertaining.There are some good features on the DVD also.  It added to the experience of watching this film.Recommended.  And I can't wait to see Vol. 2.	5.0	Violent and brilliant -- a Quentin Tarantino masterpiece	2004-08-01	2	1	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A30VYO4BWRSLLW	linnell_99@yahoo.com	"I am a very big QT fan and an avid kung fu film fanatic. When QT announced Kill Bill as his next film I was absolutely thrilled. The decision to split the movie into two 90 minute parts was not a way to make more money for Miramax (although that is a perk), but rather it allows QT to create a much more involved story than one film would have, also it is a homage to the fact that the old school kung fu films were usually a maximum of 90 minutes. Anyway to the film, the plot stays faithful to the typical ""seeking revenge"" motif in most kung fu movies. Some people may have disagreed with the extreme violence inherited in the movie, but this comes from the classic Shogun Assassin films in which blood sprays about fifteen feet away the victim if decapitated or even scratched. In a way Kill Bill isn't as violent as Shogun Assassin in this sense because a simple cut does not exhibit spraying blood in Kill Bill, only the decapitations or dismemberment.However, the violence is very tongue-in-cheek and really inspires laughter. I am not a very big anime fan, but the chapter in Kill Bill that was anime set the mood for the violence to follow and it was a funny send up about how ridiculously violent some anime can get. The camera work was very impressive, as the camera angle did not change every five seconds that ruined the fight scenes in the Matrix and Matrix Reloaded. Switching the camera angle quickly is not artistic, its just a way to cover up how crappy the fight scene really is and how the fighters have no talent.Everything about this film is perfect from the fighting, the violence, the plot, and the music, which has to be the best I've heard in a movie since Gladiator. Kill Bill is hands down the best film of the year, and maybe even QT's career."	5.0	Best Ode to Old School Kung Fu Ever Created	2003-10-12	9	3	6

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3SKGQSU29ZV80	Lleu Christopher	Kill Bill is an ultra-violent rollercoaster ride of revenge, sword fights and B-movie martial arts trademarks. Quentin Tarantino has the unique ability to take old, hackneyed material and remold it into something original and exciting. He also has the knack for creating scenes that are filled with suspense, pathos and humor all at once without any of these qualities negating the others. There is a deadpan humor throughout this film, from the very first scene, when The Bride (Uma Thurman, whose character's name is not revealed) and an old enemy (Vivica A. Fox) fight to the death in the middle of a suburban house while the other woman's little girl arrives home in a school bus. The humor works because the characters themselves are unaware of it. Everything that happens is absurd, exaggerated and bizarre, yet the actors play it completely straight rather than winking at the audience as in some would-be clever films. Uma Thurman's performance is, of course, a crucial element that makes Kill Bill so effective. Her character is somewhat reminiscent of La Femme Nikita, who is also a beautiful and somber killing machine. The plot is simple and senseless. The Bride has been left for dead on her wedding day, her groom and the entire wedding party massacred by members of the Deadly Viper Assasination Squad, which is led by the never-seen Bill (David Carradine). The Bride is apparently a former member of this group, but the details are never elaborated. Exposition is deemed besides the point in this straight-ahead revenge saga. The Bride awakens from a coma four years later fixated on killing every member of this gang (which includes Daryl Hannah and Lucy Liu), Bill being the last; we'll have to wait for Volume ll to find out if she completes her mission. Kill Bill is highly stylized, with black and white and even animation used to accentuate the mayhem. The cinematography is exquisite throughout, from scenes of Tokyo to a Japanese garden with snow falling upon dueling swordswomen. There is an undercurrent of parody and an inherent silliness to the whole thing. In once scene, The Bride openly carries a deadly samurai sword on board a commercial airplane; I once had a tiny pocket knife confiscated by security (and this was before 9-11).  In many kung fu movies the hero takes on many opponents at once, but The Bride takes this to new extremes when she fights every member of a group called the Crazy 88 all at once. We have to put aside any thoughts than in modern Tokyo at least some gangsters probably carry guns. Kill Bill is filled with references to other films and styles; I'm afraid many of the specific references went over my head and I had to read about them later.  Despite the humor, exaggeration and self consciousness, this is not a cold film devoid of feeling. Alongside the absurdity is a sense of the tragic. Just as the humor is deadpan, emotion is kept just beneath the surface, but it's there all the same. The Bride's sense of loss is palpable throughout the film. In the already mentioned first scene you can see something verging on remorse on her face as she explains to the young girl why her mother has been killed. When The Bride asks a master swordmaker in Japan (Sonny Chiba, another of the film's great assets)  to give her a sword to fulfill her mission, he at first refuses because he has vowed not to make any more instruments of killing. Now this is a very familiar movie cliche, but it is played perfectly straight-faced and, once again, a genuine sense of conflict comes across. I'm not sure how I feel about the movie being split into two parts; this was probably a marketing decision. Kill Bill, Volume l, true to form, ends on the kind of cliffhanger that verges on self-parody. This somewhat compensates for the inherently frustrating fact of having it end in the middle. Although I would have preferred to have it all in one piece, Volume l, regardless of how the sequel turns out, can stand alone as an extremely entertaining and accomplished film.	5.0	Vintage Tarantino	2003-10-13	2	1	1

You have to have an open mind before you go see this. When I first went my wife was disgusted beyond words, right after the comment made by buck and the vasoline scene we found our way in through the parking lot to the car. The blood is plentiful and the action is as well. I was Highly impressed. This is my favorite Tarintino film to date.The Soundtrack was great as well.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3NZVCL9N8CLHB	"Logical Paradox ""Irrational, but True"""	Kill Bill is what is hailed as the much anticipated &quot;4th film by quinton tarintino&quot;. If you don't know who quinton tarintino is, then I feel sorry for you. For the rest of us I need only mention the titles &quot;Resevoir Dogs&quot;, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, And &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; and then you will understand the anticipation this new film has for us big time QT fans.So as the long-awaited 4th film, we find Tarintino taking a new dirtection... firslty, this is Kill Bill vol 1, with Vol 2 having just been released in theaters as of this writing. Seeing the first volume immediatley shows us that what QT had blanned was large, stylish, and visionary! The fact that The lead star Umma Thurman actually particiapted in much of the conceptual work behind the film only serves to further display why this film came together so brilliantly.Kill Bill, as it's appropriatley called is a tale of revenge at it's most basic. Umma Thurman Plays an ex Assassin, who was betrayed at her wedding by her former boss. The plot throughout the movie leaves some gaps to be further explored in the next film, but plenty of detail and background is given to all the characters throughout the course of the movie (a trademark of tarintino is brilliant character depth). Once comming out of a comma, &quot;The Bride&quot; as she is called (we never get to hear her name in the movie - it is bleeped out!) goes on a path of vengence that will leave a thick trail of blood in it's wake.Harking back to old martial arts films of the 70's the mood is sometimes made to feel corny intentionally. Oddly enough not only didnt this bother me, it made the movie more fun and more enjoyable. What's amazing is QTs abillity to switch moods in the film from being epicly dramatic, and almost philisophical in nature (like many old sammuri movies); to being goofy, and corny and almost poking fun at itself. Also we are treated to scenes that have wild western feels, as well as refrences to other old genres. The film is filled with LOTS to dwell on and think about.Beyond that we have QT's typical directorial excellence. Vissually, Kill BIll is probably one of the finest works I've ever seen. The movie has more style, flair, and wit than almost any other I can think of. QT just has a way of always finding some new place to put the camera... some new trick to use that u werent expecting. An entire 10 -15 minute scene in the movie is fully animated in japanese style! The use of black and white and other little artistic ideas of QT make this movie an absolute pleasure to watch. If nothing else this has to be one of the most creative and unique films you'll ever see.Finally, this is QTs first attempt at making an action orientated film. The fight scenes are really well done, and in the climactic battle we see umma thurman single handedly fight 60 plus men (all with sammuri swords) - and slaughter them all! Even the first time through, I had to watch that scene twice! QT also has a way of bringing the action together with many moments that are (typical to his style) nothing more than witty diologue.IN the end, some people wont like this movie just because it's too &quot;wierd&quot; for them, or just not their kind of film. Those who dont like QTs style are likely to not be impressed. But for me, and many others, Kill Bill Vol one was an AMAZING movie, on many levels at once. The variety of themes, the amazing visual style, and the excellent audio (thanks to the RZA from Wu Tang Clan who produced the soundtrack)... this movie really surprised me by just HOW good it was.	5.0	This movie just blew my mind!	2004-05-03	5	2	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AO759ZMBXCAPF	"L. Patino ""cheeto999"""	"I was asked this question after my second viewing of the film by the same guy who laughed at everything in the film, I guess you don't have to understand something to think it's funny.  My reply:  There is no point to the story, but I love the way he tells it.  That's Kill Bill to me, and more over all of Tarantino's works.Hyper-Stylized, gory, ""lacking social value"" are all things that have been said in reviews of this movie.  Hyper-Stylized was also used to describe Moulin Rouge, I guess people tend to freak out when the filmmakers make it abundantly clear that this is a FILM, a story being told, not a look into a real persons life.  So once we all accept the fact that Tarantino is doing whatever the F he wants then it will be a lot easier to accept the rest of the movie, so let's take a moment, and realize that we are all in fact staring at a screen in a dark room pretending we aren't getting annoyed by the guy laughing next to me, I mean us...Gory, yeah it's pretty brutal, but I think we have seen the last of the spewing blood, It didn't start until we were put into the animated sequence, ""what the hell is this?"" another question by my astute cinematic colleague.  By taking us into the cartoon Tarantino is setting up the over the top, realistically animated violence that would play out in this ""Hyper-Stylized"" version of Japan.  I guess to really understand any of this you need to do what Tarantino has been doing his whole life and get into some films, animated or live action from overseas.  Not like I'm expert, but if you trully want to delve deeper into the influences of the movie check out some of the films by some of the actors who made cameos in the film, like Sonny Chiba.As for lackig social value, I guess it all has to do with what your definition of society is.  After my first viewing, I proclaimed a loud to all of the offended people around me ""wow that was really refreshing"", the looks recieved after the comment were priceless. But I meant it.  The Hollywood machine is dying, if you can't see it look at how many sequels there have been.  Kill Bill, while maybe not the most complicated or socially valuable movie in the world shows the audience, and film fans like me, that there are still film makers out there that take risks, do things that piss people off, direct with innovation, etc.  I guess when your in Tarantino you can do things like that.Bottom Line:  Go see this movie if you like seeing a story told in a different way, if you don't like that, I recommend Beauty and the Beast."	5.0	So, what was the point of it?	2003-10-19	16	12	4

While the movie has some very serious issues to deal with--the plot is so twisted, how can it not?!--there are many funny moments (some I don't think were supposed to be funny, but they definitely were!).Whoever doesn't mind seeing a shower of blood every five seconds (honestly) and really wants to be entertained, see this with a bunch of friends!  And buy the soundtrack, it's AMAZING!  I love the irony of the music during the movie, too.

The elbows-out thing is for teenage-mutant ninja turtle wannnabees who have more hormones than common sense or real technique. Also, the sword is not a power art like karate where a lot of strength and power is needed--in the sword arts you're supposed to be more relaxed and fluid since you're swinging a three-foot razor blade and as the phrase goes, ""You're supposed to let the sword do the work."" In that sense they're more Tai Chi-like than karate-like. The actors and actresses here were way too tense and rigid in the way they handled the sword.The other thing is that even completely severed limbs don't spray blood in amounts equivalent to the huge fountains at the palace of Versailles. I realize Tarantino is probably poking fun at the genre with this over-the-top special effect, but still, a little goes a long way here.And finally, although I realize this is Tarantino's tribute to the chop-socky movie genre, there's no way even the greatest swordsman in the world could win against 100 other (properly trained, that is) swordsman at the same time.Despite the above qualms, I give it three stars for effort and I do appreciate Tarantino's fine camera technique and his ability to set up tense personal situations and great action scenes, and he does know how to make a good movie when he sticks to what he does best."	3.0	Okay but not great	2004-08-13	11	3	8

The action is A+, although the story is nothing new he still redefines it to be unique and stylish. The over exaggerated blood is humerous yet it's needed. This movie reminds me a lot of the 70's Kung Fu movies like The Big Boss and Seven Samurai. The Shaw Brothers style zoom in close ups are so artistic. And fight secenes are apreciated for it's artistic vision. A simply loved Uma Thurman when she sported the yellow biker suit, like Bruce Lee did in GAME OF DEATH ( a favorite of mine). I a big fan of Martial Arts films and since the MATRIX's sequel sucked so bad KILL BILL helps give us Americans hope to make more Martial Arts films. Because everyone knows the Asian made ones are much better even with subtitle. KILL BILL is buy you should make I know I am.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3DBOR4DASH1VD	Malcolm Kates	Every few years, a film transcends the directorial boundaries set before it and asks audiences to disavow their universal cinematic expectations. If successful, these pictures become the new artistic standard and send the entire film industry scrambling back to the drawing board. Quentin Tarantino's 4th film, Kill Bill, is one of these, accomplishing more in each of its minutes than most films do in their entirety.There are millions of movies. Why is Kill Bill any more profound than Crouching Tiger, the Good the Bad and the Ugly, and the Matrix? The rivers of blood and remarkable fight scenes aren't the reasons, as cool as they are. No, it's the film's chameleon-like blend of genres; Tarantino takes pieces of Kung-Fu, Anime, the Spaghetti Westerns, and Pulp Fiction, adds a dash of 70's funk, and molds together a colorful and explosive patchwork. Though each borrowed style already exists, their mere combination represents the movie's originality. So as thievish as Tarantino's tactics may seem, the recipe tastes too good for anyone to care.This in mind, grab your kitana, hop on your motorcycle, and speed to the nearest mega-plex. Kill Bill is superbly entertaining and worth seeing twice, three times even.	4.0	Kill William	2003-11-04	3	0	3
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1IANEBSMVGHS9	"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny"""	"By the time ""Pulp Fiction"" came out we all knew that Tarantino was no ordinary director, after his break into stardom with the cult classic ""Reservoir Dogs"". After a nine-year hiatus, he came back with a movie that's a pastiche of styles and another successful attempt by the director/writer to share his cinematic vision.The movie borrows equally from westerns, kung-fu/samurai movies and anime flics, with the broken timeline that is so characteristic of Tarantino movies. Add to that an exquisite soundtrack (largely courtesy of RZA, with eclectic touches by a range of artists and genres, from Nancy Sinatra all the way to Zamfir's pan flute, and flamenco music) and you got another cult classic right out the gate.While not as great as Pulp Fiction, the movie elements that make Tarantino great are all here. There is a good share of  violent moments, though they are mostly toned ""down"" by the sheer exaggeration of some of them, which makes them surreal at best. There is a host of dialogue lines (most of them by Uma's character, The Bride) that are ready to become standard e-mail signatures. Finally, the art direction was impeccable: the incorporation of an anime to tell the story of the childhood of O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu's character) was simply brilliant!All in all, in spite of the violence (not a HUGE fan of blood, I admit it), I loved the movie and I have Volume 2 lined up to be watched next weekend..."	5.0	Brilliant moviemaking!	2004-08-29	4	0	4

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q	"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;"""	Kill BillQuentin Tarantino has a unique ability to create violent films that combine almost Haiku like moments of extreme mayhem with cutting humor and drama.  The inevitable result is a viewer who sits magnetized for the duration and then must puzzle through a variety of simultaneous reactions to the film.  In 'Kill Bill,' starring Uma Thurman as an assassin dead set on revenge when her wedding is turned into a bloodbath, Tarantino not only lives up to all expectations but develops a whole new grammar in the process.Both killers and 'The Bride' were once a deadly team (the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad) but broken apart by Thurman's desire to retire to a more normal life.  This is the first film in a series that will follow 'The Bride' as she takes on each of her tormentors, culminating in a final confrontation with Bill, their leader.  For this stanza her targets are Vivica Fox and Lucy Liu.What sets the film apart is that it is conscious of its art.  While very much a lampoon of several genres (samurai, lady assassin, Yakuza, spaghetti western, etc.), Tarantino uses black and white as well as animation to set aspects of the story apart.  Experiment shot angles and sudden changes of scene also build the nervous energy that marks the entire film.  We shift from church to hospital to kitchen and back again like jumping jacks.  One moment we are in a nightclub full of whirling killers, and the next we are in a Zen garden in mid-winter.The result is a visual extravaganza - sudden perfectly choreographed moments that whirl by almost to quickly to absorb.  The script is as terse as the visuals are complex.  This is physical acting, not narrative development.  Tarantino pays surprising attention to the musical work, both the scoring (flamenco samurai?) and the madcap gyrations of the 5, 6, 7, 8's who turn surfer music into a post-modern experience.The violence, of course, is way over the top, even for Tarantino.  Revenge pushes all other considerations out of the way, and I can't think of any scene that someone won't find offensive.  In a sense, this is a harrowing look at aspects of our psyches that contradict our preferred view of ourselves.  Tarantino allows no space to be sacred or safe.  Even though the film has so much that is artistically right, one can't enjoy it without the sense that there is something terrible wrong as well.	4.0	Through A Glass, Darkly	2004-05-19	3	2	1

The quality is much better; vibrant and rich colors ( a little grainy in places). You will notice more on screen than the standard DVD version. Disappointing that they left part of the sword fight with the Crazy 88 in black and white. The Japanese DVD has it in color. I thought they could have done that with the Blu version..but no.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3GOH75VU8ZF6B	Mark Correal	A vengeful bride, a murky assasination plot and lots of violence and gore are the key elements in this Quentin Tarantino movie. As ususal, he tells the story in a series of plots which relate to a larger theme. The problem is that at times the plots are not in sequence. This leads to some confusion on the part of the audience. Combine this with the undeveloped background of the characters and the audience is left with too many questions. There is a humorous element in the premise of a bride (unnamed) who is exacting revenge with a Katana sword, sort of like Bride Magazine meets Highlander, but overall it is a silly unbelievable plot with little redeeming value. Some good sword techniques if you are into the Martial Arts though. I understand Volume 2 will be out soon and will explain some of the things which were left out in this version of the story.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2DAHERP7HYJGO	Mark Turner	"I know that title may not mean much since this is only Tarantino's fourth full feature. But this is a movie that leaves you wanting more. Granted that will happen with the release of part two. But until that time, fans will have to salivate over this portion.The story: a lady know only here as ""the Bride"" (Uma Thurman) is nearly beaten to death at her wedding. She is then shot in the head at point blank range by Bill (an unseen David Carradine). She goes into a coma for four years and awakes to find a hospital attendant has been offering her ""services"" to anyone willing to pay. She takes out the current customer and the attendant and tries to leave.Flashbacks tell the tale here of how she was part of an assassination squad, the deadliest ever assembled. When she tried to leave, they took her out instead. On her wedding day. While she was pregnant.Now awake from her coma, she has plans for revenge. The film opens with her attack on what seems like a normal soccer mom (Vivica A. Fox). The two spar back and forth using what they come across as weapons, ending with knives. When Fox' little girl comes home, they pause to set up a time and date to finish. Then...well I won't blow that for you.Flashback again as we see the Bride heading to Okinawa. There, she has a sword crafted for her by the best maker alive (Sonny Chiba). He's stopped making them but when he learns of her intentions for this one, especially since Bill was his prot&eacute;g&eacute; at one time, he makes her the best sword possible.Sword in hand, she head to Tokyo and the first person on her list: O-Ren Ishi (Lucy Lui). We are treated to an anime tale of how she came to rise from a little girl who watched her parents murdered to an assassin to the head of the Japanese Yakuza. She will not be someone that the Bride will take out with ease.The confrontation takes place in a Japanese night spot. Not only does the Bride have to face off against Lui, she must first take on the gang she leads, her own group of sword wielding assassins. If she can get past them, she faces O-Ren's personal bodyguards. And finally, she will face off against O-Ren herself.What happens to this point, and I am sure you can guess the outcome, ends the picture. Almost. A special cliff hanger is dropped on the viewer just before the credits role and the anticipation of seeing part two explodes.This movie is Tarantino's tribute to the movies he learned to love visiting what he calls ""grindhouses"", those cheap low scale theaters that were full of unsavory characters in attendance and needed hosed down with bug spray almost nightly. Tarantino grew to love these movies in their environment and while working in a video store. His love of these movies, everything from spaghetti westerns to samurai films, is apparent in most of his movies, but never as much as it is here. This movie is an homage to those films.The action in this film fills the screen more than not. The blood in this film flows bright red and fluidly, so much so that even though it appears fake it still elicited oohs and aahs from the crowd I saw it with. Everything from splitting a man in two to decapitations to mutilations is on view here, reminding me of movies like SHOGUN ASSASSIN. And it should. That is the exact type of movie he is paying his respects to!More than anything this movie was made for fans of movies. Note, I did not say ""motion pictures"". I said movies. There's a difference. While members of an elitist film scholarly group will embrace this movie because of the name attached, it is the fans of movies that will love this one."	5.0	ONE OF TARANTNO'S BEST	2008-03-15	3	2	1

The time and effort that has gone into the film is amazing and it shows. Uma Thurman is fantastic and Daryll Hannah is extremely creepy. Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Liu round out the terrific cast.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2NY7C7O942258	Mars Burton	The time spent viewing the first half of Tarantino's latest film floats by without notice.Perfect timing, deft acting performances, and a visual style all to it's own are the highlights of the first half of Tarantino's latest film. Uma plays the perfect femme fatale as The Bride. Her low-key, yet intense, portrayal of a woman intent on revenge is believable and powerful.The greatest accomplishment in Kill Bill has to be the timing. Not for a second are you catching the time on your watch, thinking about the cute girl who you saw at lunch today, or wondering why monkeys don't grow beards. Every minute, every scene, is filled with important story pieces and action. If there were ever a perfect action flick, this may be it.But that isn't to say that the movie doesn't have any flaws. Guys may have a hard time trying to get their girlfriends to attend a movie as violent as Kill Bill; heads are decapitated, blood sprays liberally, and rape is a prominent theme in the film. The film may also pose a threat to those not accustomed to directing style of Tarantino. He quickly moves scene to scene, not often leaving the viewer to catch their breath- a style also seen in the work of Guy Ritchie.Overall, Kill Bill is a very entertaining, and very violent, action flick that'll leave you on the edge of your seat waiting for volume two.	4.0	Good action flick, but keep the kids away	2004-05-16	2	0	2

So when I get asked what my favorite Tarantino film is, I say Kill Bill, then specify part one. Stylistic, well-acted, and candy-coated in blood and violence, this story goes between real life and cartoon, back and forth through time, and opens up a long, winding plot that grows thicker with each question answered. I'm not an Uma fan, but she pulls off the calm, angry, badass chick with a katana in a way that is rarely done well in movies, and manages to get some convincing emotion out here and there.Great music, great dialogue, and a fantastic story with empathetic characters kinda leaves you wishing it was longer than the total story's four and a half hour runtime.	5.0	Stylistic Tarantino-ness at its best	2013-01-12	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	"As I understand it, ""Kill Bill"" was originally planned as one movie. When director Quentin Tarantino announced that the finished product would run nearly three hours, the distributor, Miramax Films, had an aneurysm - in today's short attention span society, an audience would never sit through a movie of that length. A compromise was agreed to: ""Kill Bill"" would be split into two parts. Thus, ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1"" is only half of a movie. Luckily, the ever resourceful Tarantino was able to engineer the split so that ""Vol. 1"" is itself a superlative treat. [The main problem in dividing the movie into two parts may be that it allows each part to go on a bit too long. The combined length of the two parts is now 3 hours and 41 minutes.]In the first volume, The Bride [Uma Thurman] wakes up from a coma. Her last memories are of being ambushed on her wedding day, when she was the only one in the wedding party to survive a group of assassins. She vividly remembers who they were and sets out to kill all of them. In this part of the movie, she dispatches two of five. In the next part, we assume she finds the other three.The trick to enjoying ""Kill Bill"" has to do with not taking it seriously. The movie turns comic book characters into live performances. There is violence galore and lots of blood, but it is not meant to be taken literally. It's a cult thing - either you get it or you don't. If you get it, it's a lot of fun. If you don't, it's gross and stupid."	4.0	Extravagant cult movie is a lot of fun	2004-04-25	2	1	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AKZ1Q9S0Z3G6V	"Matthew Perri ""Matthew Perri"""	Tarantino teams with Uma Thurman to invent one of the coolest characters I think I have ever seen in any movie to date. 2003's &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is one of the best films of this year if not of all-time and it's a damn shame that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences is too conservative to realize how great it is.Uma Thurman stars as &quot;The Bride&quot; (her real name is actually bleeped out whenever it's uttered) and she's pissed as hell. She is a former assassin apparently on the verge of getting married after running away to restart her life after discovering that she is carrying her boss's baby...only her boss, &quot;Bill&quot; (David Carridine) finds out and sends her former teammates to gun her down at the chapel...but wait, that's just the beginning of the story. And it's brilliantly retold, short and to the point, in a grainy black-and-white two-minute sequence at the film's introduction. Bill is yet to be revealed. All we hear is his voice; soothing, yet dark and foreboding...and all we can see is The Bride's pained face as she lies on the floor, sweating profusely and bleeding to death. She tries to tell Bill that she is pregnant with his child and it's cut off by a bullet to her head.If you are trying to make sense of anything I have told you thus far, don't. If you think I've given too much away, I haven't. You see, The Bride WILL kill everyone she has set out to kill because that's her motivation. Thurman's character is practically invincible with the skills of the greatest martial arts fighter in the world and the momentum of a Mac truck. It's HOW she kills that provides you with surprise and suspense. And if you're thinking that this is a self-indulgent gore-fest with no plot, you're very much incorrect.The Bride is smart and cunning and you identify with her cause. More so, I would imagine, if you were a woman watching this movie. In fact, you can't call Tarantino sexist or mysoginist because almost every female character he writes is intelligent (save for Bridget Fonda's character in Jackie Brown, but Tarantino adapted the character from the book, so that doesn't count) and has the ability to play on the same field as men. In fact, Bill's entire staff of killers, save for Budd, is a female so, technically, this is a chick flick but a chick flick lovingly dedicated to a group of women with their arms held aloft with pride and conviction and Uma leading the charge with a sharp sword and a bad attitude.Like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, this movie is presented in &quot;chapters&quot;, making it feel like you're watching a great epic novel come to life in front of your eyes. Each chapter introduces a character, or a backstory told in different types of media. A few examples of this: The Bride's death is recorded in black-and-white as if you are watching history unfold, O-Ren Ishii's twisted origin is Japanese hardcore hentai anime, and characters fight in silhouette against giant screens that, at once, turn red, then blue.These are truly epic moments told with truly epic style and fashion with giant doses of wit and flair added for good measure. An example is one of my favorite exchanges in the film is between The Bride and O-Ren after The Bride has mowed down O-Ren's gang of fighters (nicknamed &quot;The Crazy 88&quot;):O-Ren: &quot;Silly caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords. You didn't think it would be that easy did you?&quot;The Bride: &quot;Actually, for a second there...yeah...I kinda did.&quot;O-Ren: &quot;Silly Rabbit...&quot;The Bride and O-Ren (at the same time): &quot;Tricks are for kids...&quot;Or the soft-spoken and very solemn bragging coming from master swordmaker, Hatori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba of &quot;The Street Fighter&quot;, one of Tarantino's favorite martial-arts films):Hanzo: &quot;This is my finest sword. Should you encounter God in your travels, God will be cut.&quot;The humor injected into each scene makes the fights following them seem all the more deadly and enticing and dramatic. Swords ring and slice, knifes cut through the air, bullets boom, women spit venom into the word, &quot;b***h&quot; whenever they trash-talk, and the blood...oh, yes...I did forget to mention the gallons upon gallons of blood, didn't I? Violent? Well, I still defend this film against those who say that violence is only justified in films regarding religion, mainly because while this movie is violent, you're really not supposed to be taking it seriously. I find it hard to believe that when someone gets a belly-full of sword, then has that sword removed from their belly, that all the blood they carry flies forth as if the stab-victim has a pressurized water cannon readilly installed in their stomach. It's violent...but it's outrageously violent and in that way, that is where the movie gets its charm. Sure, it's pretty dark charm, but it's charm nonetheless.The great amount of detail that Quentin Tarantino has applied to this film is unbelievable. He borrows from old Sergio Leone westerns, 60's martial-arts movies, action films, anime, and great sweeping dramas. The only genre that Tarantino leaves untouched is the movie-musical and science-fiction although, one would suspect that if Tarantino had enough time, he would cover those, too. I could almost imagine Tarantino ressurecting the acting career of Mark Hammill and casting him as a hip alien who tries to kill The Bride for killing Bill, a friend of his.How good is it?Remember that part in &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; by Tarantino's good friend, Robert Rodriguez, when Johnny Depp tells Antonio Banderas that he is so crazy for the pork dish he is eating that when he is through, he is going to walk into the kitchen and shoot the cook?Oh yes, it's that good, but I'm not shooting the cook 'cuz I want more.**** out of ****--Matt	5.0	Butt-Kicking High Art	2004-07-30	6	5	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1E6ATXSST59UR	Max Requenes	I saw this movie when it came out and was unimpressed. Several friends have named it as one of their favorites, so I gave it another shot. Meh.It has no plot. Almost no character development. No suspense. And none of that classic Tarantino dialog.The plot, if you call it that, is of a revenge picture, wherein the heroine, who you've never met and who you know, or care, nothing about, goes through a list (literally) knocking off all the people that tried to kill her. That's it. Oh, and she spends 20 minutes of screen time buying a sword.The only character development whatsoever if of one of the assassins on the heroine's list, O-Ren Ishii. It comes via an animated sequence which is the best part of the movie. As a consequence, O-Ren is the only character we care about. And she's #2 on the list.There is no suspense at all. For one, the &#34;Volume I&#34; is in the title, so you know the heroine likely survives for the sequel. She is also so over-the-top tireless and skilled (and apparently, like Wolverine, she never bleeds) that you never doubt she will prevail, even when she's facing a hundred or so trained killers at once.The dialog is dull. And delivered in Uma's typical monotone, shopping mall, nail polish style.I asked my one of my friends why he likes this movie so much. &#34;Dude, it's so violent!&#34; OK. Now I know who not to go to for movie advice.I gave it two stars for choreography and a few bits of interesting camera work.

And like a forest it is easy to lose your way, to get lost, to forget where you came in"". This phrase, said by a secondary character, expresses quite well the essence of this film. Quite simply, ""Kill Bill"" is a revenge movie.The plot is not overly complicated, although it is somehow strange. A former assassin (played by Uma Thurman) is almost killed during a rehearsal of her wedding. It seems that her former lover and boss, Bill (David Carradine), and the members of his ""Deadly Viper Assassination Squad"" here holding a mean grudge. They attacked the wedding party, and viciously but cleanly shot everybody everybody dead. That is, except for ""The Bride"", who they hit repeatedly before Bill shot her in the head, despite the fact that she was pregnant. They left her for dead, but instead she fell in a profound comma.The bride woke up years later, remembering exactly what had happened, and all that she had lost. Of course, she knows exactly who is to blame for everything: Bill. And so she begins to wreck her vengeance on those who destroyed the future she wanted, with a husband and her baby. The bride will begin by killing everybody in Bill's death squad, and will ultimately reach Bill himself.What else is to be said about this movie?. Well, ""Kill Bill"" is a bit over the top sometimes, and it cannot be denied that it has lots of blood and violence. Strangely enough, that didn't make me dislike the movie, because the special effects that turned many scenes into blood-baths weren't overly realistic, and the dialogue in those scenes emphasized the fact that not everything should be taken seriously. The director, Quentin Tarantino, probably made this film as an homage to martial arts films, and added his eccentric touch to it. The excellent results are evident in ""Kill Bill"", for all to see.Lasty but not least, I would like the point out that the audio and the subtitles in this dvd are available in many languagues, including Chinese and Japanese, so if you are trying to learn them watching ""Kill Bill"" could be a good way of practicing  without having to make too much effort.On the whole, I can say that I really liked this movie. It was not the kind of film I usually watch, but I ended up enjoying it a lot. A word of advice, though... If you can, rent ""Kill Bill"" and ""Kill Bill 2"" at the same time, or you will end up running to your video store after watching the first movie, in order to watch the second one immediately :)Belen Alcat"	4.0	"""Revenge is never a straight line"""	2005-07-09	4	4	0

His movies ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" and his screenplay for ""Natural Born Killers"" are full of violence. Kill Bill is no different. For those not interested in violence this movie isn't worth watching.The aforementioned movies are very good for another reason; their excellent screenplays really make the movie that much better, the violence is usually just a part of the overall story. Now it's the other way; the violence is the main part, the story is flimsy at best.I have seen numerous Asian movies over the years and Kill Bill reminded me of them. ""Crouching Tiger"" for example is based on a trashnovel and Kill Bill could be the same. For some reason the Asians can still make movies like this a lot better.The fight scenes are good, but again not as good as can be.If this movie was made as an ode to Asian kung-fu movies he really pulled it off because they are very similar, but American this time.See ""Hero"" instead, a movie Tarantino helped to be made."	2.0	Worst Tarantino	2004-09-13	11	4	7

The start is pretty interesting, as well as the bleeps. The black and white and anime scene are clever. Also, the movie doesn't go in order exactly which is interesting.

Turn on the blender, with the lid off.  Whatever splatters on the wall is Kill Bill...and I do mean splatter.  This is the ultimate movie for film fanatics.On the surface this is a fantastically gory, bloody action film.

The vast number of tributes made to the films and styles that have inspired him will have a knowledgeable viewers' head will spinning from trying to catch all the references.  I know that I will see this movie again and again.This is not a movie for the faint hearted, rather a deserving R-rated flick for the gore lovers.

First off, you expected this to be so great and all since Pulp Fiction came out. You in your mind are just comparing it to Pulp Fiction, cause this movie was almost as good as Pulp Fiction to me. All of you are complaning about ""dynamic charcters"" are crap like that. Well guess what, If you were a bride at a wedding, your husband and baby got killed and you got shot in the head only to wake up four years later, you would want revenge right? You wouldn't change cause all you care about is revenge, and this to me was very realistic. And who cares if the gore was like a spray hose? I found it funny whenever someone died, and the gore with just awesome, and he wanted to make all these gorey fight scenes cause the movie gets more interesting.The anime was also great, i thought that tarantino decided to try something new and so what if you didnt like it? It was still a creative way to play out the story. I mean what 11 year old girl is gonna act and pretend to shoot 3 guys, impale someguy, and sit under a bed while some woman dies ontop. I was also completely shocked when she killed ""copperhead"" in the beggining telling the daughter ""you mother had it coming to her"" By far the best scene was at the meeting with Lucy Liu, and the japanese man calling her something bad so she goes to kill him.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2E9TRM8096BXU	"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson"""	At the risk of sinking my lofty Amazon.com reviewer ranking into the depths, I must warn you that I have come not to praise this film, but to bury it. Well, maybe not bury it, but certainly kick a little dirt on the glittering monument that is all these five-star reviews. Now wait....take that finger off the &quot;unhelpful&quot; button (yes, you!). Hear me out first. Then vote me down. It's the American way.First let me admit by saying I am not overly enamored of Quentin Tarantino. I thought &quot;Reservior Dogs&quot; was excellent, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; somewhat over-rated but still quite good, and &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; predictable, boring and forgettable. On the plus side I think &quot;QT&quot; is highly imaginative in a kind of Dr. Dre sense, meaning he has no original ideas himself but is a genius at cobbling together his manifold influences (film, TV, comic books, et al) and creating something new out of them; I think he is a film-buff's film-maker, who truly loves the 70s pop culture he grew up in and celebrates it at every turn,, I think he's extremely funny and has cojones of brass to make such offbeat films in a Hollywood where hundred-million dollar cookie-cutter projects are the order of the day.On the down side I think Tarantino's dialogue, while highly entertaining in small doses, grows a bit tedious and self-indulgent over time (the long, boring scene between Bruce Willis and his girlfriend in the hotel room in &quot;PF&quot; is a good example);doesn't have much of a sense of pace (his films often drag), and seems to have the kind of juvenile obsession with graphic blood-spilling and violence that is usually found in people who have seen neither firsthand.All these things are on display in &quot;Kill Bill&quot; a quirky, retro-style takeoff on, well, just about everything from Japanese chopsockey flicks to Italian westerns to the awful &quot;Batman&quot; series in the early 1960s (just with lots more blood and dismemberment). As usual, QT laces the film with homages and peppers it with appearances from familiar faces and pet actors(David Carradine of &quot;Kung Fu&quot; fame; Michael Madsen, Uma Thurman et al): you have to admire the highly personal way he makes a film, as if it were a class project and not a major motion picture release with millions in studio money riding on it. The story, like the characters, is so straightforward as to be non-existent: a retired assassin is put into a coma by her treacherous former comrades, and later wakes up looking to deliver some serious payback, which is accomplished with a custom-made Japanese kitana and a lot of droll one-liners. The actors are good, the dialogue ain't bad (the scene with the Japanese swordmaker and his angry assistant is hilarious, until it drags on too long) and the visuals are sumptuous. Unfortunately, the film has too many self-indulgencies and boring spots: even the scene where she slaughters the Crazy 88 goes on too long, and all the flying limbs and fire-hydrant jets of blood get tedious after awhile. That, and the ever-present martial-arts movie question of why one of them didn't just shoot her a la Indiana Jones in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark.&quot;Of course, &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is not meant to be taken seriously. The movie takes place in a stylized quasi-reality and the blood and beheadings are done in such an over-the-top way that even people easily grossed out or offended would have to laugh (and if they don't, they probably should know better than to watch). The problem is, QT doesn't quite stick to the formula: the scene where the Bride kills the black assassin in front of her own child is valid as far as the story goes, but it is not in the best of taste.I am aware that this film was originally one big three or four hour production, later cut into two separate movies, and that this may have effected the story and pacing, etc., but I can only judge the movie on what I saw, and I wasn't all that impressed. It wasn't great. It was, however, interesting enough to see, &quot;Volume II.&quot;Now....go ahead and hit that &quot;unhelpful&quot; key. Thanks for waiting!	2.0	Ho-hum.	2004-07-20	6	3	3

Kill Bill Vol. 1 is perhaps Tarantino's most entertaining and fast paced film to date.  It is extremely creative and inventive. It's like a madcap combo of shaw brothers style chop socky kung fu, brian de palma's suspense, blacksploitation's sound and edge and the spaghetti western/samurai film sense of purpose and storyline.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2GZTI0EIOCQNZ	"M. Hind ""daria_m"""	"From its television spots and trailers, one might have guessed Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" would be a stylish Samurai ""Crouching Tiger"" type of film.  Well, that assumption is correct, but the movie indeed turns out to be so much more as the critically-acclaimed director applies his own originality and wit.Uma Thurman returns to Tarantinoland as the Bride, a revenge-obsessed woman who was the only survivor of her slain wedding party.  She sets out to track down the group of assassins responsible, including title character Bill (David Carradine) who put the near-fatal bullet into her head.  Tarantino uses the same ""out-of-order"" technique he's used in the past to tell the story, which might give away certain details in the film, but doesn't necessarily take away from the suspense.  The plot follows the Bride as she tracks down each assassin one-by-one to kill them.Tarantino dances between B&W; and color, and live action and anime to really capture the pace and mayhem of this twisted fantasy world (or maybe just to capture the Japanese spirit of the film).  He also divides the story into chapters, setting up some of the biggest scenes.  And while some violence is past Tarantino efforts has been unsettling to watch, it is blantantly over-the-top and almost cartoonish in this film.  But don't think you can get away from a QT movie and not squirm in your seat.  There are moments, like the one with the ""paying visitor"" to the hospital, that are quite disturbing.All in all, this is a bloodbath with a bite.  As you sit back and realize this is one of the most violent movies you have ever seen, you will also find yourself laughing at times at the clever dialogue and a few gags.  So as you go through every emotion while watching ""Kill Bill,"" you will most certainly appreciate Tarantino's mission to offer something different and provocative to movie-going audiences.  Everything's here: great performances, great cinematography, great music, and that little something extra.  And the best part is, it's not over!  We still have another volume to venture through which will undoubtedly offer much-needed backstory explaination and set up the Bride's final vicious showdown with Bill.  I'm glad the film was split into two parts because I believe the exact moment this first segment cut off was enough to wet the audience's appetite for Volume Two.Now that I've reviewed the film, I feel I must now offer a note in post-script.  While I, a 23-year-old, thoroughly enjoyed this film, I had an inkling of distraction in the back of my mind because there were two children under seven sitting on my same row.

It has the usual Taraenteno trade-marks, violence, mayhem, and a nod to pop-culture.  There are unexpected surprises and if you thought Tarenteno's style  from his last movies was wierd, this one is even wierder. I first thought the assassin for revenge plot would be pretty lame but it turned out quite entertaining in the QT sort of way. Uma Thurman is excellent as ""The Bride.""

""Kill Bill, Volume One,"" his fourth feature length film shows that commitment. From the very beginning, QT lets you know that this movie has it's roots in '60s chop-socky cinema. When you hear the themes from ""Ironside"" and ""The Green Hornet,"" you know this is going to be very different. When he starts quoting ""Ancient Klingon Proverbs,"" you know it's not to be taken seriously.Uma Thurman is ""The Bride."" A woman left for dead on her wedding day, along with the rest of the wedding party. When she awakens from a coma four years later, revenge for the day in question is her goal.While this is filled with primarily cartoon violence, it is a bloodbath of cartoon violence. It never really stoops to gory. However, it is relentless in it's pursuit of another limb to vanquish. If you're squeemish about such things stay home. Otherwise, enjoy the twisted genius that is Quentin Tarrantino."	4.0	I still haven't decided if I liked it.	2003-10-12	4	2	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1TJPMB7N776WS	MICHAEL ACUNA	"The big hubbub about the violence and blood in Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" is pretty silly in that all of the scenes featuring blood and violence, which come to think of it is most of them, are played for whacked out, cartoony fun: not to be taken seriously at all.Still, at the core of this film is the ultra serious quest of The Bride/Black Mamba (her code name...actually Uma Thurman), who looks fantastic and who plays the role straight ahead for real and without much irony, which in this context works. And if you think about it, the core role/character and her plight to avenge her attempted murder and the murder of her child and 8 others, had better be played seriously because the entire movie would fall flat without it. Even Tarantino movies need a strong central hero(ine) to act as a repository of our desires, wishes and hopes to make the world a better place. He realizes that we all need heroes: even a left for dead, steel plate in the head, revenge wracked, blond, leggy one like Thurman.Tarantino has never been one to be bashful about letting his influences show: 70's films and music, Karate movies, etc, and once again here he lets these out, style and mise en scene wise.But Tarantino has the talent and filmmaking know how to limit how much to foist upon us and here, as in all of his films, he doesn't merely recreate, he uses this stuff to create something new, something fresh, something dynamic and interesting.I could quibble about the fight scenes going on too long and that we must wait until February until Vol 2 is released but these are minor things. The major thing is that Tarantino has once again slapped the butt of contemporary movie making and shown us what movies should look and feel like, he's made a film that is fun to watch and actually participate in, he's given us a heroine to root for and a reason to look forward to 2004. And if you've noticed what has been released lately to your local theaters, this is a big, big deal."	5.0	The Bride Wore Yellow	2003-10-20	1	0	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1CDNTB7377YH2	Michael A. Newman	If you liked a movie like Pulp Fiction (I believe it was from Tarantino too) you will definately like this film.  It is sliced into chapters that are each individual stories which do not happen in sequential order.  Each chapter is excellent in itself (one chapter is done in animation) and the only reason I didn't rate the movie higher is the time sequencing sometimes gets confusing and by the end of the movie you still don't understand what happened to have Uma Thurman's wedding party attacked.The fight scenes are very unique and extremely gory, though a lot of the blood looks like colored water from a sprinkler.  Tarantino has a lot of tributes to Bruce Lee such as using the Flight of the Bumblebee song (theme of the Green Hornet), having several of the villians wear Green Hornet masks, and having Uma wear a Bruce Lee type body suit (a la Game of Death) in the grand finale fight sequences.	4.0	A different type of action flick!	2005-01-20	0	0	0

I don't understand why ...people go to see a violent movie and then afterwards, complain that the film was too violent! In the preview you see that their is sword fighting and the title of the movie is KILL BILL, but for some reason people don't think that there will be violence! TO ALL YOU ... PEOPLE OUT THERE, DON'T SEE IT!!! GO SEE A CHICK FLICK OR SOMETHING! ... To all of you Tarantino fans, The movie is awsome! Yeah there's violence in it but the blood squirts are so over the top that it doesn't make you cringe because it's so unrealistic! The violence is so cartoony that I don't know how anyone in their right mind could take it seriously! I even heard people laughing at it! The biggest battle scene in the movie is even shot in Black & White so the blood almost just looks like water! I thought that the story was great and Uma and Lucy Lui definetely steal the show! This movie is totally original and shouldn't be compared to The Matrix or Crouch Tiger, ETC.! There is an awsome anime sequence which developes Lucy Lui's character! The movie is not action packed from beginning to end! There actually is a story which to me, is more important than action! If anyone reads this review and goes to see the movie, just remember that this was originally going to be ONE MOVIE! So look at the movie as the first half of ONE movie! And for a first half....It is totally awsome!! Volume 2 will be even better because all volume 1 is doing is setting up everything for Volume 2! And beleive me, Volume 1 leaves you hanging  at the end! Anyway, I'm not going to go on and on, so to all the people out there who think the movie is called ""LOVE BILL"", just to let you know, It's called ""KILL BILL"". And if you're expecting puppy dogs and ice cream, then think again! And to all of you Tarantino fans, don't miss this awsome movie that consists of great actors, a great story, awsome cinematography, over the top violence, great music, and perfect direction!

And don't tell me that was the point because I have seen ""the storie of ricky (laugh out load terrifying)"" and day of the dead gore.  I have seen dumb gore done right and this film just does it on the cheap.  The only gore effect is the above mentioned manequin and the old ""put your arm behind your back while I chop a fake one off"" routine.Quintine snuck into your DVD/CD collection, pulled out the samuria trilogy, the five deadly venoms, duel to the death, ghost dog, the fatal flying guilitine, the profesional a few of your favorite songs, etc. (...) added some ""boss fights"" ala mega man/sonic the hedgehog/mario and made a compilation disk. But the problem is you have already seen all of these movies and heard all these songs so why do you need a demo disk?  why do you need a demo disk of a game you already own?At the end of the day the movie fails completly because Quintine DID NOT make the movie he wanted to make.  he made the movie he thought I wanted to see, and that is the oldest of all the traps the devil has set for artists.Peace"	1.0	lame Lame LAME	2004-04-03	36	4	32

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2ZLROGIL2V7GV	Michael Crane	"Quentin Tarantino is back in full form with ""Kill Bill: Volume 1.""  Just when you think he cannot surprise you any more--he does.  Even though he acknowledges the fact that the film is inspired by various genres of film that he loves, such as Spaghetti Westerns, Kung-Fu flicks and Samurai pictures, you can tell that this movie has his name written all over it.  Action packed and often times very funny, this is a movie that delivers again and again.""The Bride"" (we do not know her real name until the second volume) has been left for dead by the very people she has worked for when it is apparent that she wanted to settle down and have a family.  They made a big mistake, as she survived and is looking for payback with absolute determination.  She has made a list of the people who are responsible for her supposed death, and she plans to take them head on without any fear.  Armed with a sword and an undeniable craving for vengeance, she will not stop until they are all dead... including Bill.  The first volume's main focus is on what has brought her to the beginning of the movie and the events that have fueled her thirst for blood.The main thing I always enjoy about Tarantino is that you never know what to expect from his movies.  He has never recycled his act and is always looking for fresh and unique ideas.  True is the fact that the movie is inspired by certain genres of film that has made him the avid film lover that he is today, but he is able to add his own and personal touch to it all.  Very much like ""Pulp Fiction,"" he plays around with time to tell a very simple story, which really helps us to believe that there is more to it all.  The writing is smart and terrific, and his direction is absolutely flawless.  Uma Thurman really shows that she can be an action hero, but she also is able to add a human quality to her character.  Lucy Liu is also great in her role and gives a very chilling performance.The movie is very violent, so it's not for the squeamish.  The levels of violence differs from time to time.  There are times when it is very goofy and purposely over the top, and resembles something you'd see in a low budget horror flick.  Then there are times when the violence is very real and will make you cringe a little.  However, if you are a long time fan of Tarantino's films, then you should have no problems with the film.  The DVD has a few goodies to offer, but not a whole lot.  It's sad, because I know they will re-release these two movies with more extras and special features.  I don't blame Tarantino for this, though.  This reeks of Miramax's doing.  Still, it is a good DVD.  The picture and sound quality is more than excellent.  Extras that are included are a making of feature, musical performances and trailers.  The making of feature is definitely a recommended feature to check out.""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" shows us that Quentin Tarantino has not lost his touch.  Even though this is only the first part, it is still a standout film.  The last few minutes leave us begging for more, but we are still very satisfied in the end.  Filled with lots of dazzling action sequences, a great cast and a smart script, this is one enjoyable flick that you won't want to miss out on.  Think you've seen it all from Tarantino?  Think again. -Michael Crane"	5.0	Revenge is never a straight line...	2004-08-09	8	5	3
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A76GWMMHDDFID	Michael D. Deforbes	Was it as marvelously constructed and zany as Pulp Fiction? No. Was it as tight a story as Resevoir Dogs? No. Did it at least have better fight choreography than The Matrix Reloaded? Maybe. But for all that, I can say that it was one of the most satisfying action films I've seen in a long time. Why? The plot isn't anything new, a revenge story. The reason I liked it so much because it is great to see a film by someone who loves the medium and knows how to make a movie.Again, the plot isn't anything new, and there aren't any well-drawn characters, but it's the way it is told and the choices made. Clearly he is grabs from several genres: 70's action movies, kung fu films, and anime. But he is also showing a deep reverence and understanding of them as well. He knows that deep characterization in these types of films aren't necessary, what is necessary is good pacing (settting up the action sequences) and a witty sense of style.This Tarantino has in spades. From the opening scene showing an all out brawl between two women in a suburban living room, to an extended anime sequence that covers the life of an assasin (a sequence that is ingeniously inserted between the lead character trying to wiggle her big toe), it is clear that Tarantino loves to make the kind of movies he is known for and shows it.  This is Tarantino's first crack at a good old fashioned revenge action movie and he shows his mastery of the medium. The edits were crisp and the pacing of each action scene had wonderful satisfying arcs of tension and release.The action scenes show a sense of style and coolness, but doesn't resort to Charlie's Angels-type silliness. There have been complaints about the gore, but when you watch the film, it is actually is darkly funny because it is so over the top. Take for  instance the scene in which a yakuza boss has his head cut off, the blood spurts unrealistically as if from a sprinkler and continues to spurt a few more times before Taratino cuts the shot. He knows what choices will work in the tone and language of the film and it is great to watch.Before the movie was over, I saw some people walking out of the theater. I guess they weren't pulled into the world of the film. For a film-lover like me, this was a real treat. Tarantino doesn't make deep character driven films with epic overtones and realistic action scenes. To me he is the film lover video clerk who happens to also be a great filmmaker. I was even happy that the movie was cut into two volumes. For a movie of this kind, it ended exactly when I had finished taking it in.	4.0	A Satisfying Action Movie for Film Lovers	2003-10-12	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A386HL3FK1AQKO	"Michael D. Murphy ""Murfdawg"""	I actually saw this movie while I was underway since the Navy gets advance copies to watch before it hits stores and have to say that the type of action in this particular flick comes in short supply these days and apparently on the first release of the DVD, so do the extras.  For those wondering, this knocks it down a star.  I was really expecting a two-disk, boatload-of-extras extravaganza and all I got was a making-of featurette (a relatively short one at that) and a couple of music videos from the band featured in the film.  I take comfort in knowing that this is just a regular box office marketing ploy and there'll be special editions lining the shelves during Christmas time.  Enough said about that though!  In the meantime, you have a rock solid movie that entrances and entertains and well as makes you laugh and cringe (LOL....the end fight scene makes me do both).  Wonderful, colorful characters with a meandering (meaning this in a GOOD way) plotline.  Tarantino has struck gold again and will be very much looking forward to seeing Vol. 2 on the silver screen when I get the chance.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3QZCA4LTTVGAD	Michael J. Mazza	&quot;Kill Bill, Volume 1,&quot; is an intriguing addition to director Quentin Tarantino's quirky body of work.  The film stars Uma Thurman as the survivor of a vicious, bloody massacre.  The story follows her gory campaign of revenge against those responsible for the bloodbath.&quot;Kill Bill&quot; is a visually exciting film that features an animated sequence within the mainly live-action story.  The film is ultra-violent, full of swordplay and shooting.  But curiously the extreme gore and death never struck me as gratuitous, but rather as integral to the story and to Tarantino's artistic vision for the film.  One might think of the film's violence as a twisted form of visual poetry, in the tradition of such films as Dario Argento's &quot;Suspiria.&quot;Thurman leads an exciting multiethnic cast that includes Lucy Liu, Daryl Hannah, and Vivica A. Fox.  &quot;Bill&quot; is especially rich in its powerful roles for female actors.  The whole cast is superb, but it's Thurman who really shines with her gutsy, smart performance.&quot;Bill&quot; is spiced with some great elements of humor and absurdism.  The film is structured like a book, and uses an interesting nonchronological technique to tell the story.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A5AUQ5R754O6E	"Michael Kavanagh ""HighburyGoon"""	In keeping with Tarantino tradition, the body count is high, the profanity flies, and the soundtrack kicks. &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is a tour de force, with the familiar Tarantino storytelling devices, such as chapters and a non-linear storyline. I found the amount of blood in this film surprising, even with having had full knowledge as to the nature of the film prior to heading to the theater. Where other movies would have pulled away after the slash of a sword, Tarantino delights in showing the audience the aftermath of each hack and slice. The result is a mixture of elicited emotions - from revulsion to slack-jawed amazement.It's obvious that Mr. Tarantino has a certain degree of reverence for Asian cinema, and an affinity for all things Samurai. The fight scenes are a marvel; both horrific and beautiful at the same time.The cinematography was exciting and inventive, and the acting sufficiently overdone - which meant that it was just right for the type of movie &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is trying to be.I suppose what it all boils down to is this: Kill Bill Vol 1 is a movie I will watch again, and again, and again.	5.0	What a bloody great movie this is!	2004-06-19	4	3	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ	Michael K. Smith	I have to admit, Quentin Tarantino is something of an acquired taste. I loved this film, as I have nearly all his stuff. My wife hated it -- as she has nearly all his stuff. Tarantino grew up on Hong Kong kung fu flicks and _Kill Bill_ is filled with homages, from the name of Sonny Chiba's character (&quot;Hattori Hanzo,&quot; taken directly from the old &quot;Shadow Warriors&quot; television series), to Uma Thurman's Bruce-Lee-style yellow jumpsuit, to the Kato-style masks the Crazy-88 gang wears, to the galloping theme music that accompanies nearly every fight scene. The plot is simplicity itself: The Bride (Uma Thurman) was left for dead when all the rest of her wedding party was killed by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and now the Bride -- a top assassin herself -- is taking revenge, one enemy at a time. And it's taking her four hours to do it, hence the two parts of the film. Lucy Liu is terrific as O'Ren Ishii, head of the Tokyo yakuza, and Vivica Fox does a good job as the first bad guy to die. I'm not sure I care for Julie Dreyfus as Sofie Fatale (or what's left of her) and Darryl Hannah apparently hasn't aged well at all. But Chiaki Kuriyama is (you should pardon the expressioin) a kick as the killer in a schoolgirl uniform -- a direct reference to Japanese manga tastes. Even if this crazed film isn't entirely to *your* taste, you'll have to admit -- Tarantino's movies may not always make good coherent sense, but he does *great* scenes!	5.0	Tarantino strikes again!	2004-07-15	2	0	2

Tell me?All I could see, was a kung-fu movie, but instead of it beeing a plot about ancheint ninjas in Japan who have an enemy who disgraced the secret dojo, they have a woman who's seeking revenge for all the people who hurt her.For starters, what the heck is with the Mask Of Zorro henchmen? There about as threatning to look at as Lucy Lu's 10 minute long motionless stares into outerspace. Then there's the blood shed, it's not gross, it's just plain bad, everytime someone looses a limb, there blood comes praying out like jet streams from a shower...which is most likly the way the effect was done. And poorly I might ad.The plot dragged on and on and on, and did not thrill me or get me interested in the plot at all. Uma Thurman's best role? I dont think so. She's done better then this over hyped garbage. It's an old 70's style kung-fu movie with a budget. But at least those old Kung Fu movies where watchable. This Kill Bill however went no where. So the vengfull Uma Thurmans charactor wakes up from a coma, magicly recovers her walking ability in a few hours after beeing in a coma for a few years, and seeks the people who put her in the coma. Travels accros the world, kills a couple of hundred henchmen, and then we wait for the next movie. Well, I wont be bothering with the next one.If the movie had cut out the long boring staredown constests that went for too long, they probably couldve shortend the movie enough to fit whatever they have filmed for Kill Bill 2 into this movie. But instead, everytime they go for a sword, they take a stare at it, then stare at each other, useless dialog, a quick combat , then splatter..... all through the movie. How ever did such brillinace get thought of? Lucy Lu's charactor was annoying, it played like an old video game where you have to kill a thousand bad guys before you get to the boss.I'm all for woman becoming action stars. And I hope more woman become just as big a name as any previous mega hit action star. But this movie is not the step to follow. It's riduclues martial arts antics of jumping around and making those stupid &quot;whoosh&quot; sounds when the flip or move there weapen did not fit well into this movie. It could have been alot better, yet, probably 30 minutes of the movie is a staring contest which is the most annoying thing of the film. Lucy Lu was the worst of them. For someone who was supposed to be such a great leader of the &quot;Mask Of Zorro In Suits Gang&quot; she sure didnt act threatning in any way. I wouldnt say its the worst of the martial arts movies around, but it's by far anywhere near as great as all this hype has been about it.So the &quot;people to kill&quot; list continues in Part 2. You wont find me veiwing it.	1.0	Charlie Romio Alpha Papio	2004-06-07	22	8	14
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	"""Revenge is a dish best served cold.""Quentin Tarantino's fourth film and the first one since 1997's Jackie Brown takes the theme of revenge like Hamlet on steroids. It has not been an easy road for this generation's ""It"" director. Tarantino once worked at a video rental store before writing the script for Reservoir Dogs that he later directed. It was his directorial effort in 1994's Pulp Fiction that catapulted Tarantino, as well as the independent film company Miramax, into the Hollywood mainstream. Unfortunately his next film, Jackie Brown, which, by the way, was not written by him, was not widely accepted and then Quentin Tarantino dropped off the scene for nearly six years. In that time period he took time off to act in some films but, for the most part, the idea for Kill Bill had been bouncing around in his skull. Now that idea has burst out of that skull in all its blood spewing, gut splattering glory reuniting Pulp Fiction star, Uma Thurman, with the acclaimed cult director in a film series that pays homage to the 70's karate films that many us grew up with.The story centers on a former member of a group of assassins who seeks revenge for the actions done on to her by her former colleagues. A woman known only as The Bride has waken up from a four year comma after her former boss Bill left her for dead on the day of her wedding killing her fianc&eacute;, the wedding party and her unborn child. Unfortunately for the skilled assassin, he made one big mistake: he failed to kill her. Now that she has awakened from her living slumber, The Bride will travel the world picking off her attempted killers one by one including the mysterious Bill. First up on her list is O-Ren Ishi, aka Cottonmouth, and her group of Japanese underground assassins. They better watch out because here comes the bride! The story for Kill Bill (Volume I) is probably one of the best scripts of the year despite being only half of the true plot. In a wonderful bit of technique, Tarantino starts the film off in the middle of story then backtracks to the events that start the chain reaction of revenge. He then flashes backwards and forwards in several instances that offer the best insight into the characters the audience is about to encounter. This gives better meaning to most of the fight sequences that take place in the course of the two hour feature.A relative bunch of low-profile actors and actresses make up one of the better casts of the year for this film. Uma Thurman, who starred in Quentin Tarantino's breakout film, Pulp Fiction, once again works her magic for the talented director in probably her best film performance. Thurman gives a witty and exhilarating go around with her role as The Bride seeking revenge against her former colleagues. She presents a style to the character that makes you clamor for her all the way to the shocking break point. Lucy Liu has another kick-ass character performance as O-Ren Ishi, the leader of a group of Japanese assassins. The only problem with this role is that it makes Liu feel type-casted into this sort of character. Not that she bad at it, she's extremely effective in her performance, but you get the feeling that eventually she may get bored with these roles but if it works for her then ignore this comment. Vivica A. Fox doesn't really get to show much acting ability as her character is killed off in the first fifteen minutes of the film but what she does show is her amazing fighting moves, which is the only evidence needed to prove her worth in the film. This is only a small portion of the full cast, the rest of which will appear in Kill Bill (Volume II) coming February 20th.Overall, Kill Bill (Volume I) is a wonderful kick-off point for Quentin Tarantino's best work since Pulp Fiction, despite only being half of the entire feature. Though that being said, there are a couple of things to pick at including the well-choreographed action sequences. It wasn't exactly the sequences themselves but the rather large amount of blood and gut spilling that occurred during them that had more then one person squirming in their seats. Granted having your arm or leg cut off results in a large amount of blood loss but does that blood spew out like a fountain? The campy style of violence that occurs in Kill Bill (Volume I) may seem disturbing as the feature starts off but by the end, it doesn't seem so unnatural, which says something our culture's customization to violence and bloodshed in films. The pacing of the feature seemed well balanced but definitely dragged near the end as the film wrapped in a spin-chilling conclusion for the time being. But other then those small squabbles, Quentin Tarantino gives an eerie insight into what the concept of revenge does to the human psyche and what it could potential lead people to do if not controlled. It is said in the film, revenge is like a forest. Men (and women) can easily be lost in it and lose track of where they started or where they were going, so caution must be taken when start off on this path. The famous cult director starts off with accelerating beginning; let's hope he can deliver on what the chilling twist promises."	4.0	The Moose Hole - Tarantino's Fourth 'Kill'	2004-01-03	17	15	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1EML1UO6Z03WJ	Mig	The Bride wakes up after a long coma. The baby that she carried before entering the coma is gone. The only thing on her mind is to have revenge on the assassination team that betrayed her - a team she was once part of. (IMDB) The lead character, called 'The Bride,' was a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, lead by her lover 'Bill.' Upon realizing she was pregnant with Bill's child, 'The Bride' decided to escape her life as a killer. She fled to Texas, met a young man, and on the day of their wedding rehearsal was gunned down by an angry and jealous Bill (with the assistance of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad). Four years later, 'The Bride' wakes from a coma, and discovers her baby is gone. She, then, decides to seek revenge upon the five people who destroyed her life and killed her baby. The saga of Kill Bill Volume I begins. (JD) Great action movie that will leave you wanting to see the sequel.	4.0	Revolution in what it means to be an assassin in an action movie	2012-12-07	1	0	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1D1MIFRSG50Y3	Mike S.	"Kill Bill is a story of revenge.  You have to know what you are getting into with a Tarantino movie.  Lots of over-the-top violence and gore, off-color humor and bad language.  If any of those are immediate turn offs for you when choosing a movie, don't even think about this one.  You will hate it.  If you can accept those things, and you like his other films, you will very likely love this one.As the title reveals the story is split into two parts.  You only get bits and pieces of it in volume 1.  Uma Thurman's character (just called ""The Bride"") is beaten and shot during her wedding rehearsal by members of the assassin squad she used to be a member of, lead by the titular Bill.  She awakens from a coma 4 years after and goes after them.  In this volume you are introduced to all the characters (somewhat) although Bill is never shown.  You just hear his voice.  The story kind of jumps around a little (somewhat to the way it did in Pulp Fiction) but it is really not that hard to follow if you pay attention.Volume 1 is actually the more violent and gory of the two films, although there is a lot in both.  The gore however is so extreme it is more tongue in cheek than it is real.  Like chopping off arms and gallons of blood spewing out like a geyser.  It is meant to be more humorous than scary, and is far less believable than what you would get in a horror movie.  Like the title of the review says it is kind of a combination of a western, with the 1970s martial arts films.  Right down to The Bride having to go through tons of subordinates to get to her main target in the climactic fight scene.Whether you like this or not is totally subjective.  If you are a fan of Tarantino's other movies, this is very much in a similar vein. It definitely deserves its R rating, and will not appeal to everyone.  For everyone else though, it is a great story, well acted, funny in parts (although very dark humor) and had lots of action.  If those are the kinds of things that appeal to you, it is definitely worth adding to your collection."	5.0	Part spaghetti western, part 1970s martial arts movie, all awesome	2013-07-28	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1H5KCR76NTSZT	"Milo ""gjm"""	It's basically a comic book for teens. Overblown dialogue and  fight sequences in the tradition of those ridiculous choreographed Hong Kong Kung Fu Flicks of the 70's. Sometimes stylish in a trashy way and with occasional flashes of great music (loved the Japanese girl rock band.) But overall it gets boring after a while and your eyes drift to the clock. Worth a watch just to see what all the fuss was about, but ultimately a dud.	1.0	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Matrix	2004-04-15	19	7	12
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	The Bride (Uma Thurman) awakes after 4 years in a coma to the realization that her entire wedding party was massacred and her unborn child lost, when she chose marriage over her  career as a professional assassin. Bent on revenge, she sets out to track down her former employer, Bill (David Carradine), and her former comrades in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), who were responsible for the bloodbath that put her in a coma.&quot;Kill Bill&quot; is ceremoniously billed as &quot;The Fourth Film by Quentin Tarantino&quot;, and this time the irrepressible director has set out to prove his talent by directing an action movie, which he considers to be the toughest genre. If it weren't tough enough, Tarantino has drawn on just about every action genre that ever existed to create this high energy protracted battle of a film: Hong Kong martial arts film, 1970s grindhouse cinema, spaghetti westerns, blaxploitation, gangster movies, japanimation, and film noir. And I'm thoroughly impressed. &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is possibly more an exercise in style than any film I've seen. What's more, the genres that it emulates tend toward the absurd. &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is self-consciously stylish and preposterous. Yet it is entirely captivating and exciting. It's gory. It's funny. It's in black-and-white, split screen, animated, color...No style is spared, and yet none is out of place. There's hardly a plot, but &quot;Kill Bill&quot; keeps the audience interested in the story -mostly by telling it out of sequence. I'm a huge fan of film noir. Quentin Tarantino's fantastically creative facility with neo-noir has endeared him to me in the past. &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is noir, among many other things. And if Tarantino can make this completely preposterous film work, I have to concede that he's a genius. He has even succeeded in convincing a large American audience to watch a movie that has subtitles. &quot;Kill Bill, Volume 1&quot; is thoroughly enjoyable, action-packed, and not for the squeamish.The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary and 2 performances by the Japanese musical group &quot;5, 6, 7, 8's&quot;. &quot;The Making of Kill Bill&quot; is a 20 minute documentary that features interviews with writer/director Quentin Tarantino, Uma Thurman, producer Lawrence Bender, Lucy Liu, and Viveca A. Fox. It starts out talking about the genesis of the film and its concepts, then moves on to discussion of filming. The performances by the &quot;5, 6, 7, 8's&quot; are two songs from the film, but the camera focuses on the musicians instead of placing them in the background, as they are in the film.	5.0	Creative, Energetic, Ultra-Violent Genre-Bender.	2004-04-29	1	1	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1KAR9G699RM56	M. Miller	Kill Bill, Volume 1 started was filled with a lot of energy, and Quentin Tarantino, seeing how it was his movie, definitely left his 'better' marks on it.  However, I could not fully get into the movie.  I know that Kill Bill is a homage to old Asian fighting movies, and spaghetti westerns, and in that light the movie flows, but from an average viewer standpoint who probably has not seen too many of those, it just is a lot of fighting with a lot, and a lot, of fake overdone bloody scenes.  Now, if you like Quentin then you will probably like this movie, because it is done in a very creative, yet still Quentin style.  I guess, the movie overall is okay, especially since they had the time to put in a creative anime sequence, but I still did not think too highly of the movie overall.	3.0	A lot of oomph and a lot of Quentin	2004-04-17	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1E15WYG9C47X1	"""mobby_uk"""	Although I feel that Quentin Tarantino's reputation as of the the best directors of his generation might be overblown, I still can not deny the fact that his films have offered me great enjoyment in their unique and original style and very smart writing. I found Pulp Fiction to be his best, while I thought Reservoir Dogs was certainly ambitious but not the masterpiece that it was made up to be, being too gratuitously violent for my own personal taste, while Jackie Brown was certainly a disappointment. So it is with some interest that I watched Kill Bill, not knowing what to expect and what surprises were in store, typical of Tarantino's writing.And yes I did enjoy the film very much, yet I had some reservations too.The film is a delight to watch, and is crammed with homages, from Kung Fu films,David Carradine, Westerns, Japanese Yakuza movies to Japanese animation, and it really looked like Tarantino,similar to a child running loose in a toy store, was enjoying himself immensely with all the ideas and tributes that drives him as a director and as a first rate movie buff.The success of the film is in telling a very simple story of revenge and dressing it with various styles to animate and liven it far beyond its basic premise.The film was too violent and gory but in a totally different way: it was hilarious..Not unlike Sam Raimi's Army Of Darkness, the violence was too overblown as to render it comical rather than disturbing, especially the main fight scene towards the end, when Thurman manages to kill dozens of swarming gang members..My reservations about the film is the slightly pretentious air that hovers over the movie..The credits informs us in bold letters that it is the 4th film by Tarantino..and the idea of the main character was by QT (!!)..Moreover, stretching as I mentioned a very simple story into two films was a bit over indulgent.This is why when I left the theater, and despite enjoying all the hidden goodies of the film, I just did not feel any lasting connection to it.Uma Thurman was as good as you expect her to be under the direction of a very sympathetic director like Tarantino, and Lucy Liu was particularly suited for the tough Yakuza boss role.Kill Bill is still a very good film that you will enjoy very much, more so if you do not dwell a lot on the 'genius and masterpiece' behind it all..Just a well directed and scripted film from a talented director who loves cinema's geniuses and masterpieces.	4.0	Tarantino is Back with a Vengeance	2004-04-16	6	5	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2QWEFSPX33C5L	Modrnknght	"I have seen Kill Bill Volume 1 several times now, and each time it it grips me from start to finish.  There is just no walking away from this picture.  Describing the plot is simple: ""woman looks for revenge against former members of the gang who tried to kill her.""  That's the easy part...discussing it in detail is hard.  It just doesn't lend itself to a ""She did this and he did that.""  Tarentino has incorporated so many styles here, from Japanese action films to Anime to American small town duster to almost graphic horror picture.  Its a tribute film...and it is a trendsetter.  And I don't think in hands other than Quentin Tarantino could it have been done as well.A revenge pic can always be a downer, but Tarantino keeps it engaging from one battle moment to the next, while even introducing some humor into it, and EVERY - SINGLE - ONE of the incidents where ""The Bride"" confronts those who have done her wrong is an action masterpiece of its own.  Whether it is the tightly-enclosed livingroom and kitchen battle with Jessica Fox, or the pastoral setting of Lucy Liu's Japanese winter garden, Tarantino is in complete control.  No small feat.  And the actors are wonderful, especially Uma Thurman.  Even the tinier moments are nicely-casted.  Sonny Chiba is mesmerizing as a former swordmaker.The video quality of the Blu-ray is exceptional and colorful.  But Tarentino certainly makes it hard to describe.  One moment, you are watching a black and white film, then an animated film in blood-dripping red, then ...oh, I give up.  Anyway, the great news is that it all look superb.Audio is a knockout!  Clarity is incredible and you will likely have to bring down the volume lest someone think people are being killed in your home and furniture being smashed.  Bravo!  All the musical themes overwhelm the senses (as well as all of your speakers).The extras are good but in standard definition.  A too-short making of documentary, plus a 5-minute section of two songs by the all-female band 5,6,7,8's.

One Word can only be used to describe this movie: WOW! I had high hopes and this surely surpassed them. I can't wait for Volume: 2 this Friday, which is already getting rave reviews and being called better than the first Volume which is hard to believe but most likely true. Uma Thurman rocks in this movie! I had no idea she could pull off a physical role like this and I can't picture anyone else in the role of The Bride now. Lucy Liu is also shockingly good in this ruthless role where she cuts off the head of anyone not in agreement with her. I love the fight scenes of course, with the over the top and unrealistic gore, but its the soundtrack that really molds the movie together and fits perfectly with each scene. This is easily my favorite Tarantino film (or at least until Volume: 2 comes out!) because it is less talky than his other three movies and it showcases the action and style we all love him for. Loved the cliffhanger ending and can't wait to actually see Daryl Hannah (Elle), Michael Madsen (Budd), and especially the man himself, David Carradine, in action as BILL on April 16th!	5.0	Wish I Would Have Caught This In Theaters!	2004-04-13	0	0	0

They were great movies... but this movie is an imitation of Sergio Leone\Ennio Morricone work. There is no vision here... In fact what tarantino has done is work backwards. Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns were inspired by Japanese films amongst many things. Here, Tarantino turns a spaghetti Western back into a Samurai tale. There are scene for scene shots from 'Good, Bad and the Ugly' and that makes me angry.Its an entertaining film but Tarantino is just ripping Sergio a new one... Kill Bill Vol II and Inglorious Basterds aswell.Then there is the homage to B-grade movies ahem ahemand the manga derived animation... as if we've been hiding under a rockHas he devoted his life to resurrecting other people's work.He gets the big bucks for this?

Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a great movie filled with action, intense fight scenes, and yet humorous in some parts of the film. The action scenes in this movies were incredible. Although I don't think this is Tarantino's best film it's still up there. Uma Thurman's character gets beat up by a squad while she was pregnant on her wedding day and then seeks revenge on them. If you have not seen this film I recommend that you do. This is probably the best movie I have seen for a while. And I am bumped for Vol. 2!

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	APIW11UEPKIC2	"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ..."	"Now obviously this movie is basically a homage to old school kung fu movies.  But he also puts that great tarantino touch on it by making it an actual movie, as unbelievable as it is, and putting in his great dialogue, and I would have to say that this is the best movie he has directed to date next to pulp fiction.The first fight of the movie is spectacular and always gets ripped on by huge martial arts fans.  Let me fill you people in on something, this is Vivica A. Fox and Uma Thurman going at it, not exactly Michelle Yeoh vs. Ziyi Zhang or Moon Lee vs, Yukari Oshima, but they both perform exactly what that scene needed. In fact  everyone produces in every screen.  With how tall Uma is I thought she was definitely the best performer in the movie.  I like part 1 more than 2 but Pai Mei almost put that one over this.But the way tarantino manages to pay homage is magnificent.  Like the scene where Hanzo says to Uma ""cut down Buddha if he stands in your way"".  That is a great line but the significance is so much greater if you are a fan of tehse movies.  Tarantino does a good job of no COMPLETELY stealing a scene from an old school flick.  Like when he stole the ear scene from one of my favs ""Ninja In the Dragon's Den"", he didn't rip it all the way off, he could have made Michael Madsen even funnier and cooler if that is believable.  But the ""Buddha"" line comes form ""Shogun's Samurai"" where the prince's fencing instructor tells him a way better line that you will have to see to find out what it is, but I love it how tarantino could have stolen the whole line to make a better, but he has that respect.  Also Sonny Chiba is in that movie and he ALSO played a character name Hattori Hanzo in a show called Hattori Hanzo which unfortunaly will never get released in America:(  Or he comes up with something original all on his own where Uma has chopped up everybody at Lucy Lui's  house and  this little like 15 year old is holding a sword to Uma and is shaking like crazy and Uma asks him ""why aren't you in school""?  That is a great point, it does always seem like in all these movies everybody just trains in martial arts and nobody works or goes to school to actually get an education.  It may take a little while to sink in, but you will extra appreciate that scene because of the way he is actually making fun of old school kung fu.  So by the end of this one we get a sin city type of feeling and you know that you can't wait to pop in volume 2 after seeing this.Extras are pretty much nothing but like 15-20 minutes of good insight on the movie.  But I really cannot recommend this DVD only because a special edition HAS to be coming out soon with tons of extras and at least one commentary I would think.  Anyone know any news of these?"	4.0	tarantino finally got to make the movie he always wanted to	2006-06-11	3	1	2

After being introduced to the main character &quot;the Bride&quot;, I felt very connected to her, and each character that was introduced after that.  I found myself laughing out loud a lot more than I thought I would, it possessed a somewhat dark sense of humor which added greatly to the already great list of things I loved about the movie so far.  Yes, there is a lot of blood, but it's meant more in a comical way than in a realistic way, used to prove just how strong and powerful a person the Bride is.Although the plot is basically a revenge story, it feels like so much more.  You get to meet and understand the characters she's planning to kill before she kills them.  I felt almost sad after she killed them, because they really earned my respect as characters by the time of their death.Lastly, why I loved this movie so much was because it looks so beautiful on the screen.  The cinematography is just gorgeous.  Despite all of this, I still feel that my understanding of this movie isn't as deep as I'd like, I'm sure there are many points that I'm missing.  See this movie.	5.0	Excellent on many levels	2004-06-27	2	1	1

After mysteriously being awakened by a mosquito, she vows revenge on the people that took her down and ended the life of her unborn baby.Yes, sweet bloody revenge is what this movie is all about, yet at the same time behind all the slashings, beatings, shootings etc there is a very powerful story. Quentin Tarantino was deeply influenced by samurai films and the exploitation movies that were coming out around his early years.This movie delivers the goods including a virtually endless body count, music that fits perfectly with each shot, and classic references to other media and merchandise.This is a film that is NOT to be missed.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AO4J90YPX5RU6	Moviebuffer101	"Quentan Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" is hard to put in any particular genre of film. It's of the Tarantino genre of film I guess. It's a masterpiece in any case. Everything done in this film is done intentionally. Mr. Tarantino has created an artistic violent film that most of his real fans will appreaciate. The violence is approached with a percentage of humor. What I mean is when a head is chopped off or a limb, it isn't done in a realistic style like Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" or Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" for instance. It's done in a Mortal Kombat video game buckets of blood like way. Which adds humor to the macabre. As soon as I saw one of the very first shots of the film I knew I was going to have a great time with this movie, ..The scene involved Uma Thurman & Vivica A. Fox in the best girlfight of the decade. Well the best until the next girlfight scene short after that one, it comes much later with the 17 year old bodyguard of Lucy Liu's character. Notice the name of the cereal that Vivica A. Fox fixes for her daughter, it's comes with a surprise. Look for ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" in APRIL '04."	5.0	To get revenge on 5 people Uma hacks her way through 200	2003-10-25	0	0	0

I loved the way that he used music instead of words to describe a character's every feeling. Partial credit to the RZA for the music. It is simply amazing.The story is very simple. It's about a female assassin who betrayed her boss who inpregnated her. She is getting married. And, her former boss, Bill and his ruthless gang massacred her entire wedding party, leaving her as the only survivor. Then, Bill almost completely did her off. He shot her in her head. That leaves her in a coma for four years, six months and 12 days. After that time is over, there is only one thing on her mind - Cold, bloody revenge.And that's exactly what she gets, at least in this installment. Then, she makes a ""to-do"" list of people she must get vengance on. There is O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and, Bill, himself (David Carradine). Her quest for revenge is an extremely fun thrill ride!!!The DVD includes a Making-Of Featurette, Musical Performances from the 5,6,7,8's, and trailers to all of Quentin Tarantino's films. But, even though this film is fantastic, is pretty violent. But, it's so cartoonishly over-the-top that it's not real enough to be actually disturbing.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2POLE292AMBU3	"""mozzzzilla"""	My opinion of the movie has somewhat mellowed since the last few days after seeing Kill Bill. Still, after mellowing, I find the movie distasteful. The only thing that keeps me from rating this movie even lower is the excellent cinematography and the extremely well done fight scenes (alright, alright, the whole spurting blood thing was funny), and the insanely cool character GoGo. I understand that its a parody of many movies and has got lots of influences, blah blah blah, but all in all, it was a huge corny ball of weirdness. This movie is SO overdramatized, and sometimes the script and the dialogue makes me want to hurle. During most of the movie, it felt like Tarantino was trying REALLY REALLY hard to make a live action movie based on an anime or something. Makes my head hurt just thinking about this movie. But hey, don't let this review stop you from watching this trippy film. If you like watching skinny blond girls who speak bad japanese wave swords around, go ahead.	2.0	Yuck	2004-04-10	22	3	19
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2ZVERVFM25MJT	"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283"""	Kill Bill Volume 1 has the hallmarks of a moviemaker falling in love with making movies all over again, and with his cast and crew doing the same.  The plot's a basic revenge scenario, with The Bride(Uma Thurman) seeking vengeance on the Deadly Viper assassin gang, headed by the Bill of the title, who created a bloodbath of her wedding and left her childless.For anyone well versed in Tarantino movies, this is very recognisable as one of his movies.  The film references are perhaps a little more obvious here than in Pulp Fiction, with Kill Bill using the kung-fu action movie as its mould and then working from there.  The narrative style is also very Tarantino-esque, jumping around in a non-chronological order and playing with the audience's expectations.  And of course no Tarantino film would be complete without a killer soundtrack full of obscure tracks from obscure bands.  It's all here, and with a panache that must surprise even the most cynical viewer.Uma Thurman gives the performance of her career, adding a carefully judged humanity to her character that could easily have been two-dimensional - check out her reaction when she realises she's lost her baby.  Not only can she pull off the stunts, but she's also got a real personality behind her that few actresses can pull off (perhaps Geena Davis and Fairuza Balk spring to mind).  Here she's even better than she was in Pulp Fiction.  And that's saying something.  Crucially, she's backed up by some great supporting players.  Lucy Liu really proves that she's a big star in the making, building on her Charlie's Angels role so well that you wonder whether she could be the best breakout TV star since George Clooney.  Also definitely worth a mention are some incredibly brief but tantalising roles for Bill Carradine, Daryl Hannah and Michael Marsden, all of whom appear in Volume 2.What's great about Kill Bill is that it really lives up to the promise that Pulp Fiction gave us.  Whilst Jackie Brown fleshed out Tarantino's characters, and his script for True Romance was one of the most fun road movies in ages, there were also the relatively successful but mostly disappointing scripts he produced for Dusk Til Dawn and Natural Born Killers (significantly the latter was disowned by Tarantino himself).  Whilst Kill Bill could never be as influential as Pulp Fiction in terms of how it structures its story, or as shocking as Reservoir Dogs was at the time, it's still one of the most exciting, enthralling cinematic treats of last year.  The way it's filmed screams of a master - impressive, since this is only Tarantino's fourth film in the director's chair - and the anime sequence is particularly impressive.  Whilst it's true to say that if violence isn't your thing, steer clear, and that it's filmed in a way that makes you perhaps worryingly unaware of how violent it really is, Kill Bill Volume 1 is a rollercoaster of a movie experience and makes you long for part two.  This is brilliant, brilliant stuff, that blows the remakes and tired adaptations that seem to have flooded our screens recently, out of the water.	5.0	A tour de force in every respect	2004-04-14	3	2	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A179GX8E3M4G52	"Mr D. ""Artist/Designer/Kibitzer"""	"Improbable? Not really. Impossible is more like it and that's probably what writer/director/producer etc, Quentin Tarantino, had in mind. Now I happen to like some Improbable/Impossible type movies. I mean let's face it, something like ninety percent of what comes out of Hollywood runs the gamut from improbable to impossible. Actually I probably prefer impossible to improbable because then I know the writer/producer/director are not trying to put one over on me. And Kill Bill Volume 1, a tongue in cheek wild action movie gives new meaning to the concept 'impossible'.So what's Kill Bill about? Well, it's about bloody vengeance. It's a bloody action-packed thriller about a brutal bloody betrayal and a bloody epic vendetta! Four years after taking a bullet in the head at her own bloody wedding, The Bride (Uma Thurman) awakens from a coma and after remembering what happened to her, lusts for bloody revenge ... with a bloody vengeance! Having been gunned down by her former boss (David Carradine) and his deadly squad of international assassins, the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, of which ""The Bride"" had been a star member herself, she adopts the assassin's Golden Rule - do onto others, what they would do onto you, only get them bloody first! So, ""The Bride"" is off to Okinawa to get, what I would call, a magic sword before beginning her quest to exact her bloody revenge upon the six who had betrayed her and murdered her whole wedding party.Now, if you're thinking, gee, thats not much of a story, then you're smarter than I thought. Of course with a flick like this, it isn't so much the story as the clever presentation, the overboard action, nifty special effects and subtle repartees.CONCLUSIONSOne thing about Kill Bill, there are no innocent bystanders! Everyone in this movie is a brutal killer (at least those killing and being killed) of course Uma is doing most of the killing. There has never been a superhero that is more deadly than our lovely heroine ""The Bride"", in fact in one lengthly scene in Tokyo, she single handedly dispatches the gang of Eighty Eight, a bevy of O-Ren Ishii's personal bodyguards and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu)herself. Amazing!So what do we have? Well if you want reality I'd suggest you watch Hulk Hogan battle The Rock. If you want something akin to fantasy then Kill Bill will warm your tummy for it's a cheesy movie loaded with over the top action, subtle humor and an unbelievable story. How was the acting? Are you kidding, it's a tongue in cheek action movie! For action junkies, ignore the acting, because it's a must-see motion picture event anyway, that has some critics raving and others ranting! However, if you are a grandmother or a nun or a child under sixteen, I'd pass on this bloody flick."	4.0	Kill Bill and a Few Others	2004-11-16	3	2	1

I have enjoyed some of Tarantino's other films like &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot; and &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;. However, this movie was a let down. I understand what he was trying to do with the violence and the blood splurting out or every wond. It seemed he was trying to make a real life movie resemeling Japanese animation. It may do that is some slight ways, but the plot and the writing are terrible. I do not have any desire to see &quot;Kill Bill 2&quot;. I also find it funny that people think that this movie was originally made with the idea of making two movies and that a sequil was required due to the success of the first Kill Bill. The truth is that this series of movies was only suppose to be one complete movie. I am not sure if it was mere greed of the belief that people would not sit through the entire length of both movies combined, but Tarantino decide to cut the movie in half and try and make twice the money.	2.0	Disappointing Effort	2004-07-10	6	1	5

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ABUVAU1WDZU8T	Musashi	"Coming off the back of Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown - Tarantino returns to the screen with a film that is an ode to every Japanese samurai and Chinese martial arts film.  Vol 1 focuses more on the Japanese film tradition, with the Bride (Uma Thurman) chasing down and dishing out revenge in ways only she knows how.  In this part of the film, Vernita Green, ""Copperhead"" (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) fall victim to the Bride's well considered and stunningly executed plans for payback.My favourite scene has to be the climatic fight with Vernita Green.  Other scenes, such as the arrival of the Crazy 88 at the 'House of Blue Leaves' (silhouettes on rice paper screens as the gang members run down the halls to enter the main room) just made the film an absolute viewing pleasure for me.  Everytime I see the film, I keep looking for some of the references to other notorious Asian films.Its shocking (the first time I saw the opening sequence in the cinemas, I was surprised), the arterial bleeding (a la the samurai films), the fight scenes, the movie references and the mere existence of Go Go Yubari make the journey towards the ultimate 'end' well worth the time to get through."	5.0	Tarantino proves yet again why he has such a film following...	2006-03-23	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A23OQ3DFCKFP6J	Myles Q. Davis	I have never been a fan of Uma Thurman's work.  Often times her demure, stone-like prescence in films pushes, not gravitates, me towards her.  Likewise, Quentin Tarantino does not have my regards as being one of the best directors in the last decade or so.  But what Uma and Tarantino do in Kill Bill could have finally changed my mind.  Blending gratuitous violence, stilted-one liner dialogue, and highly stylized cinematography and fighting sequences, Kill Bill is an odd homage to stereotypical Kung Fu era films and spaghetti westerns.A little plot goes a long way for Tarantino in Kill Bill Vol.1.  The Bride (Uma Thurman) is left for dead on her wedding day.  She fell victim to a vicious crew of assassins, and ultimately received a bullet to the head after begging for her own life and that of her unborn child.  Four years later, after awakening from her comatose state, she vows revenge.  So begins her epic journey.The fight sequences in Kill Bill are delicious, spellbinding moments, only stilted by the sometimes VERY UNNECESSARY blood fountains that spray from dead goons severed limbs.  Most engaging are the animated sequences.  They are absolutely gorgeous, and happen to be one of the most poignant spots in this otherwise odd movie.In Vol. 1, viewers are introduced to Vernita Greene (Vivica A. Fox), and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu-in one of her best performances to date.)  Daryl Hannah also has guest appearances, mostly in the form of flashbacks.  Bill Carradine is only shown in snippets, so as to add to his sadistic and cold demeanor.Uma Thurman may appear as an odd choice for such a film.  Interestinly enough, she embraces the role of the Bride, giving the otheriwse obscure woman an identity that you either like or hate.  While Kill Bill is a violent and sometimes silly film, there are plenty of poignant and serious moments that add balance and credibility to the film.  In what could be the best action movie in a long, long, long time, Kill Bill may also be the most violent, and as stated before, this is not always a winning attribute.All in all, Kill Bill is a pleasing action-thriller.  Uma's quiet demeanor, Lucy Liu's ice-cold agenda (she is also given the most background history in the film-animated sequnces and all), and Vivica's blackploitation-like attitude add another dimension to what could have been just another action film with good eye candy.  Kill Vol 2. should be a great ending to odd and at times beautiful film.	4.0	Eclectic...But Not to Be Taken Seriously	2004-04-18	1	1	0

But if you are looking for another ""Pulp Fiction"", you'd be looking in the wrong place.  The movie follows Uma Thurman (Black Mamba), who has a real name that is not told to the audience during the movie(whenever she says her name, it is bleeped out).  Thurman had her husband killed in the beginning of the film, where she is shot in the head and awakens years later from a coma.The film follows Thurman as she attempts to take down ""Bill"" and the four assassins he lead to kill Thurman's husband.  The first of two volumes, Volume One focuses on the first two assassins(keep in mind, the second assassin is the first that Thurman runs into during the film- after that point, its only a flashback)Kill Bill essentially boils down to being a samurai vengance film with style.  But the style is the reason to see the film.  The music works quite well with the film, and numerious interesting film techniques are used (including a 15 minute segment in anamai cartoon form).  See this film, just don't expect the best film ever done by Tarantino.And as a side note, if you get uncomfortable with violence and bloodshed, this film is definately not for you."	4.0	Good, but no masterpiece	2004-04-08	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH	"Narut Ujnat ""Enthusiasm is contagious."""	"In summation, Kill BIll is a great movie.Now for the plot line:  The Bride - played by Uma Thurman, goes on a killing spree to exact revenge for the act of murder perpetrated at The Bride's wedding rehearsal.At first viewing, this movie is strange, full of fantasy - can you really fly on a plane with a samurai sword?, and it is like a western samurai movie.  After getting used to seeing this movie I began to think it is one of most daringly original pieces of film I have ever seen.Some of the reviews here say the movie is boring - perhaps they want constant action.  I think Tarantino is not only a brilliant action sequence director, but a really great observer of dialogue.  When O-ren (played by Lucy Liu - do NOT bring up her heritage!!) says to the Bride, ""Did you really think it would be that easy?"" and The Bride says ""for a moment there - yeah, I thought it would be that easy!"" we are hearing great stuff.  What preceded that moment is a bloody but beautiful fight scene.  Why beautiful? Because I have rarely seen moments on film with the kind of choreography that those scenes exhibited.  It was like ""Singing in the Rain,"" well, yeah, except for the bloody limbs flying around and the spurting blood.  However, after a while it seemed that the blood was not gore but rather comic.  It's like a big inside joke after a while.This movie is different.  Since the movie mimics Asian films, and the setting for Kill Bill is like many Asian martial arts movies of the 1970's, it seems natural that having an Anime segment to explain O-ren's background seems logical.  It just works.  But, what also works here are the little touches.  The scene when The Bride fights O-ren is incredibly beautiful.  This scene made me believe that Tarantino is a great filmaker.  The snow wafting down in this garden, with the fountain making its sounds ""ssshhhh tt tt"" is a little touch that many may overlook, but the fact that its there is a little touch showing the care Tarantino gives to his films. O-ren dressed in a geisha outfit with a samurai sword in white - like a bride, and yet The Bride dressed in a yellow track suit? It sure seems to make no sense, but maybe that's the point?  Damn, it is just beautiful filmmaking.What can be funnier then the 88's attacking The Bride with those masks?  What is more incongrous then the band in the club doing mediocre covers of American rock songs of the mid-60's? Who can think of the necessity of creating a myth about the Hanzo Hattori sword?  Who can forget the line of O-Ren being exposed for an airhead (hehe) and saying - ""you were right, it was a Hanzo Hattori sword!"" Who would think of why The Bride drives in a pickup truck with a vulgar term for a woman pasted on the back?  Who is Bill and why did he kill The Bride?  Like may martial arts films, we aren't told the why, but the how, when and where get answered.  And like many martial arts films, the point is the journey, not the end.Basically, this movie is a homage to Asian martial arts films where nothing makes sense but they are great fun.  So what?  It is entertainment, and if you enjoy film as an art, I think you will enjoy Kill Bill immensely.  If you are expecting a non-stop slasher movie then I say rent Friday the 13th, Part 1005 and be done with it because there are many moments fraught with thought, attention to detail and dialogue.  However, to be sure, Tarantino is a major film talent.  How can we be sure? Because like Hitchcock, Fellini, Peckinpah and others whose films are immediately recognized as being only the work of the particular director, you are darn sure that this film is pure Tarantino.  Sure Tarantino obviously ripped off many scenes and concepts.  So does EVERY artist. The trick is to rip off someones work and make it outrageously your own.  Given that Tarantino is so well thought of with only four films to his credit, and his influence already so widely felt, it is no leap of hyperbole to say he has had an impact.  With Kill Bill, he has truly taken another major step forward in making a genre his own.This movie is a pleasure to watch, because in my opinion, we are watching an artist at work."	4.0	Excellent movie - worth seeing a very talented film artist	2005-07-03	2	1	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3VS8L85Y9FSZK	"Nathan Thoms ""Nate"""	Quentin Tarantino's fourth film, 'Kill Bill,' shows how significantly he has matured as a director from his previous work in Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, andJackie Brown (Two-Disc Collector's Edition). Tarantino's improvements have been quite grand over his relatively short career in Hollywood, going from a very gritty and rough beginning with Reservoir Dogs, to continuous refinement in his followups, to 'Kill Bill, vol. 1,' which is very nearly a perfect homage to the kung fu movies of the 1970s. After having been severely beaten and then shot by Bill and his Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, Uma Thurman wakes up in a hospital, having been in a coma for four years. Her would-be husband has been killed, and presumably, her unborn child is also gone. She embarks on a mission of revenge, which, in volume one, focuses on the characters played by Vivica A. Fox, and Lucy Liu. Thurman, Fox, and Liu, all play their parts exceptionally well, but with the exception of Liu, all have acted in other Tarantino films, so their performances are not unexpected in terms of quality. Uma Thurman's character, known only as the Black Mamba, bests her foes in the true spirit of the kung fu movie genre, and includes the addition of some of the special touches expected by Quentin's fans. Volume two is set for release next year, and, it seems safe to assume, will feature Daryl Hannah's and Michael Madsen's characters more prominently.In terms of directorial prowess, Tarantino is definitely taking his place among the truly great directors in the world of film. From the very strong, but immatured promise he showed with 'Reservoir Dogs,' much has been expected from him, and to his credit, he has delivered time and again with an ever-improving final product.Pulp Fictioncertainly showed a marked improvement overReservoir Dogs (1992), but Tarantino's sometimes awkward, and occasionally unnatural character dialogue took away from 'Pulp Fiction's overall greatness. These early mistakes have served as lessons learned by Mr. Tarantino, however, as 'Kill Bill' is very nearly perfect in terms of its dialogue, writing, acting, directing, cinematography, and general nod to the classic kung fu movies that he seems to love. The homage aspects of 'Kill Bill' have been covered by critics quite thoroughly, but what seems to be underappreciated is the director's other strong influences, like the early Charlie's Angels work, and the James Bond series of films. Both of these areas play a very strong role in the overall tone and style of the movie, and it is important to note them lest all the trouble Tarantino has gone to in including them go to waste on his audiences. The RZA's soundtrack to this film is impressive to say the least. The music is absolutely perfect in its fitting the scenes and is something of which to take note when seeing this film. Anime is even included for the first time of note in a major, primarily non-animated, feature-length movie, and it is used very effectively. Tarantino certainly still has his strong ambitions toward bringing the unusual to the film-going public.The bottom line is that 'Kill Bill' is definitely Quentin Tarantino's best film to date and should be seen in the theaters by everyone who will not immediately condemn it because of its violent content. If the violence can be endured by the audience, they will be rewarded with viewing a truly great film and a very strong desire to see 'Kill Bill, vol. 2' when it arrives in theaters next year.	4.0	A reasonably good movie, if considered an homage	2007-11-28	2	2	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A36Q31ST0TLCKX	"Nawaf H. Al Taher ""Saudi_Red_Neck"""	Before I start, The movie is violent, and bloody, and Foul Language.With that said, I can only hope Vol. 2 lives up to the expecations.Anyway, VOL. 1 is an A+ Movie. PAcked with action, keeps you glued to the TV. I must also say that every character fills his/her role in an effiective way.Tarantino humor that always amuzes me. And for the Tarantino fans you will enjoy this movie because his prints and creative direction is all over the movie.Folks Please do not compare Kill Bill Vol. 1 with Pulp Fiction. Yes, Bot movies are the product of Quentin. However, It is a totally different genre. Pulp focus more on dialouge, Bill focuses more on martial arts action etc. So even the way the pace of the movie is going different.EnjoyNawaf	5.0	WHAT A START!	2004-05-26	2	0	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1QKM096E5Z19K	N. Cherone	Tarantino, being the master that he is, is (lucky for us) incapable of taking anything to seriously.  In Kill Bill volume one he has once again proven his quality as a film maker and has entertained us all.  Blood is spewn from all angles and orifaces and, in true Quentin Tarantino style, the good guy somehow manages to kill 88 people at one time.  As bizzare and unrealistic as Kill Bill was, one must understand that beneath the blood, the drama, and the action is the real heart of this picture: comedy.  The movie is simply a comedy and one must take it for all that it is.  I loved every frame and recommend it for anyone with a sense of humor (and a strong stomach).	5.0	Exaggerated to Perfection	2006-04-17	1	1	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	The long awaited fourth film by Quentin Tarantino is very, very far from being anything close to a disappointment.  Tarantino really risked a lot while crafting this homage to Japanese grindhouse cinema, beginning with the opening &quot;Shaw-Scope&quot; logo to the buckets of blood splattered throughout the film, but it all pays off from beginning to end.  When the Bride (Uma Thurman, perfectly cast) awakens from a four year coma, she sets out for revenge against Bill (an unseen David Carradine) and his Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (consisting of Lucy Liu, Vivica Fox, Darryl Hannah, and Michael Madsen); all of whom left her for dead on her wedding day.  Like Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is presented out of order before it finally comes full circle; another risk Tarantino has taken that, just like in that film, pays off brilliantly.  The action scenes are better than anything you'll see in any movie with the word Matrix in it's title, but do be warned, this is not for the squeamish.  Miramax played a large role in Tarantino cutting the film in half, but with Volume 2 right around the corner, we'll see how the bloody saga of the Bride concludes.  The features on the DVD are basically fluff, I'd recommend waiting until Vol. 2 is released on DVD which will no doubt be packaged with Vol. 1 and containing a host of features.	5.0	Bloody, brutal, and brilliant; an instant classic	2004-04-14	1	0	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1M0EQWAYGVNVR	Neburo	...Half way through is a long time to decide if a movie is too bad too watch, but it was so bad, I just didn't know if I was imagining things. This film is so violent, they had to put some of it in cartoon form! This was when I literally walked out of the cinema while people around me were p'ing themselves laughing of how ultra violent it all was! I don't know how anyone can enjoy a movie like this where it's just blood and guts everywhere! Tarrantino is one sick puppy!If you like Tarrantino films, Pulp Fiction is much better which has all the well-known actors like John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson and so on. At least this movie is realistic which tells the lifes of several people who's stories of violence, gangs, rapes are all loosely connected up with each other... Whilist this movie is just about chopping people's heads off with swords which is violence for the sake of violence! I wish people would bring out films that realistically betrays gore as it may occur in real life. I don't see too many people decapitating people with swords! IT'S EXTREMELY RARE -- EVEN MORE RARE THAN A TERRORIST ATTACK! But that's not the point, Tarrantino has gone way too far making this film! You might need to see the psychiatrist after watching this film. Luckily I didn't watch it all the way through! Definetly not a film for conservative Christians!	1.0	So violent, I walked out half way through!	2005-11-21	26	10	16

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ASDTC7NHN9AA0	"""neshev"""	For the past decade, American cinema has produced the worst there was to be made in terms of filmmaking, as well as the best. In the Hollywood brain-washing jungle universe, Tarantino belongs to an endangered species : the brilliant director. For most of the Hollywood-addicted zombies, or &quot;average movie-goers&quot; as officially stated, Tarantino's &quot;oeuvre&quot; doesn't stand much of a true appreciation chance. It is like hoping for an illiterate to appreciate Shakespeare,Proust,Dostoevski.Thus, unsurprisingly , &quot;Kill Bill&quot; wasn't a thrill in the ranks of those who still mistake John Ford with Henry Ford, don't have a clue about The New Wave in Europe, John Woo's Honk-Kong period,Japanese animation or Sergio Leone's westerns. How could they not find &quot;Kill&quot; &quot;boring&quot; as I happened to read? Tarantino is everything American cinema was at its best and everything it should be, yet it is outstanding to witness the foreign trend of his work, the broad references which appeared to elude so many.Eventually, for every person with a functionning brain and intending to keep it that way, buy &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, the rest, as Bono sings &quot;will pass&quot;.	5.0	Kill Bill : culture recquired !	2004-04-20	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1	newfound32	After watching this film again yesterday, and remembering watching it in the theater, I simply asked my self, &quot;why wasn't this nominated for an oscar?&quot;. I meant Quentin Tarantino has proved hes oscar worthy, why wasn't this worthy? It is indeed the ultimate Kung Fu movie. He mixes this movie up with a little &quot;Return of the Street Fighter&quot;,a little &quot;Game of Death&quot;, and much more Kung Fu movies. Quentin should be very proud for his masterpiece in new age Kung Fu movies. Finally no more Jackie Chan or Jet Lee in the flick to make it a Kung Fu movie.This film is very bloody and gorey, which may be hard to see. It was really hard to see for me, but I couldn't get my eyes off the masterpiece Quentin brought to the cinema. It has great cinemantography and awesome fight scenes.The story goes as the bride(Uma Thurman)is seeking revenge becuase Bill and his posse went to the brides wedding and killed every single person and put a bullet through her head, but her heart kept beating and the bride is then trapt in a coma for 4 years when she wakes up. She goes to Japan to find #1 on her list Oren-Ishi(Lucy Lui)It is the ultimate revenge movie.I have looked over the features in this dvd and there not all bad, but don't buy this, wait till kill bill volume 2 comes out and then they'll be a pack. I bought this film simply because I couldn't wait, after watching it in the theater I couldn't wait not to buy it. This dvd has a behind the scenes, and it has the origin of kill bill. How on the &quot;Pulpfiction&quot; set Tarantino and Uma Thurman how they were talking about how they wanted the movie to look like. It is a great featurrete. It has a music video from the 5,6,7,8's. This dvd also includes Tarantino's trailers for Resivor Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Kill Vol. 1 teaser, kill bill vol.1 bootleg trailer, and the teaser for kill bill vol.2. If you haven't seen this film, its a must.	5.0	The madness of Tarantino	2004-04-14	2	1	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2OFFPJZSF2NTP	N. Haubert	I did not see this movie on the big screen. I waited, mainly because I was not as impressed with &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; as I had been with &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.  Now I wish that I had seen it in brilliant &quot;shaw-scope&quot; for the simple reason that the whole movie was so visually appealing that my meager  36&quot; screen could not seem to hold it.  The blood and gore actually acts as a comic relief to the no-stop, over-the-top action when criminal laws are not the only laws being broken (the law of gravity is totally disregarded).  The final battle, one-on-one, with Lucy Liu in the snow covered Japanese garden alone MADE this movie for me.  Only Quentin Tarantino could revive an obscure disco hit like Santa Esmerelda's cover of &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; and give it a purpose.  It made me wonder why I don't still have it in my music collection. It had been a guilty pleasure of mine for a long time and will return when I buy the &quot;Kill Bill&quot; soundtrack.Bravo, Mr. Tarantino.Can I send you the bill for removing the blood stains from the floor in front of my TV.	5.0	Kill Bill &quot;If Not Now, Then Later&quot;	2004-04-17	6	6	0

If you're a serious movie fan then you've probably spent some time hanging out with friends talking about waht you'd do if you made a movie.  Alot of people, myself included, talk about putting in icons from movies that we saw when we were younger but don't get alot of work anymore.  You'd suspect that alot of filmmakers have converstions like this before they break into Hollywood....but for some reason they never follow up on those ideas.  They've apparently forgotten what it's like to be a movie geek.  Not Q.T.  In Pulp Fiction he got Travolta.  In Jackie Brown it was Pam Grier.  And here in Kill Bill he got Carradine.  All 70s icons. You just know that Tarentino was sitting around at one point with some friends talking about how he'd get Carradine in his movie no matter how old he was.  Q.T. keeps it real.2.  Game of Death costume.  Again, as with No.1 it's the ultimate geek fantasy to pay homage to some of your favorite films in your own film.  The biker suit that the Bride wears during the House of Blue Leaves fight is a replica of Bruce Lee's suit in the movie, Game of Death.3.  Hatori Honzo.  Sonny Chiba played a character named Hatori Honzo in a Japanese TV series called Shadow Riders.  The thing with this show, however, is that each season contained the same characters but a completely different story that had no relation to the previous one.  Q.T. decided to carry on the legacy of Hatori Honzo in his own movie by getting none other than Sonny Chiba himself to play Honzo.  A true testament to Tarentino's dedication to classic filmmaking.4.  Gordon Liu.  What can I say.  If you've ever seen Shaolin Master Killer....then you were no doubt freaking out at the presence of Gordon Liu in BOTH Kill Bill volumes.5.  The Fights!  Yeah we all know how incredible and intense the House of Blue Leaves fight is.  My favorite shot being the silhouetted fighting in front of the blue backdrop similar to scenes in Samurai Fiction.  But how about the brutal and realistic fight between the Bride and Vernetta Green?  Since when have you seen two women fight in a movie and end up ACTUALLY SWEATING AND BLEEDING afterwards?  Awesome.Of course, there are many more reasons to love this movie....these are simple reminders as to why everyone should own this film.	5.0	Five reasons why Kill Bill Vol.1 was one of the best of 2003	2004-10-08	13	12	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AH6U2VLKKNU2E	Nicole A. Davis	"Okay, this movie is very weird. It has annoying sound effects, gushing fountains of blood, and the usual movie version of the Japanese sense of ""giri,"" sort of a cross between honor and obligation. That said, it's also a [great] martial arts movie with a warped sense of humor. I cannot believe there are so few reviews mentioning Sonny Chiba. He and his sidekick (forgive me for missing his name) have the funniest scene in the movie, with dialogue entirely in Japanese (subtitled). Perhaps they don't want to ruin it. The movie is worth getting for that scene alone, a nice interplay of a love/hate relationship between an employer and an employee that's been around waaaay too long.

In doing so, this movie supplies action and great suspense. You will find yourself laughing hysterically, and gasping all at the same time.

I just want to start off with this movie is not all about violence.  I have heard so many people shun this explosive and powerful movie as a mad-house massacre done by a directer who has a small amount of taste.  That's true, if you walked into theater, or sat done are you couch thinking that.  But if you look farther, than the real message unfolds.If any of you have watched the anime Rurouni Kenshin (preferable the Kyoto Arc), you lucky people will have probably picked up much of the underlying art and drama of a samurai life (and probably thus who saw The Last Samurai with Tom Cruise, and understood it farther than guts and battle) and the art of the manslayer that is depicked in this film.Many of Uma's actions in battle reflect the samurai, hikori, manslayer's belief of honor and actions in battle.  Many times this is seen, when Uma spares the child's life, to the way she tells the gang to leave before they get killed.  An old manslayer in modern times.One more thing, I have heard everyone complain about the sword scene and why it was so long and 'pointless'.  To those people, you don't get.  To the rest, the samurai's sword represents the act of killing.  As it is said in Rurouni Kenshin, ""Swords are meant to kill, all the rest is a sad misunderstanding."" The sword is a symbol of Uma's cross into the hikori's way of thinking, to kill and kill those who deserve it.KillBill is an incredible presentation of what is like to walk the path of the manslayer, in addition to some Hollywood flare.  If you don't like gore, not the movie for you.  But i strongly urge to not quickly assume that this movie is bad and teaches violences to the extreme level.  Killing is wrong, we all know that.  What Quarintino displays in his movie was not made up from some madman's mind.  The underlying message and presence is from Japanese culture hundreds of years ago, awakened in a modern setting."	5.0	Deeper than plain violence	2004-04-14	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1KKGUI8WSEBZ4	N. Pierre	I had high hopes for this movie. I thought both &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; were great, innovative, interesting movies. But this movie... I totally wasted the $4 I paid to rent it.The first half was quite good. Very stylized, the characters seemed interesting, Uma was doing a great job. Then, all of a sudden, it's just all this extremely lame and gratuitious violence, not to mention that they stole (along with so many others) some of the wall-climbing &quot;Matrix&quot; moves. Boy, I'm tired of seeing those.The worst part, and my husband agrees, is that when people would get stabbed with the samurai blade or have a limb chopped off (it happened a lot), the blood would come out in the super-fine spray, like an airbrush, not like an artery had been severed. Call me a nitpicker, but that got old, too.I know Quentin Tarantino has better movies in him. I just hope he makes those movies before a third &quot;Kill Bill&quot; installment.	2.0	Very disappointing.	2004-05-15	5	1	4

I hope that this personnal review doesn't step on too many toes, but if it does-THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT.Kudos to QT,and to all of his loyal fans.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A18AINI15N4A4Z	Obadiah Noakes	Quentin Tarentino's Kill Bill Vol 1 is the first movie of it's kind I have ever seen.  Although it has very painfully obvious references to Kung Fu movies of the seventies, including, but not exclusive to, the very suit that The Bride wears for most of the end of the movie.  I fully believe that this movie could be labeled under the dark comedy genre, in that many of the jokes involved in the movie range from the fact that The Bride's name is disguised by a censor beep, to her spanking the so-called body guard with her sword, to the Monty Python blood spurt that encites a humorous reaction from the audience.  Yes, I did laugh almost every time someone lost a limb, and the absurd fountain of blood shot out.Despite how the movie has been either insulted profanely, or praised emphatically, I enjoyed it for every minute the screen was lit.  From the moment the Klingon proverb was projected to the point where Bill asks Sophie . . . oops, I almost said too much.  If you think you might be interested in this movie you will probably love it instead . . . so try it!Kill Bill; it's not just a movie, it's an assassination!	5.0	Just remember to breathe . . .	2004-03-17	9	7	2

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1GXRWBM6QFD1B	Oberon	I missed watching this one on the big screen, but having watched it on video, I don't think I missed watching it on the big screen :-)Let me qualify myself certainly not a Tarantino hater. I liked Pulp Fiction. A lot. And Jackie Brown. And Reservoir Dogs. And Desperado. Dusk to Dawn was just barely ok, in my opinion.The latest installment from the king of in-your-face-gore is lacklustre, trivial, and eminently boring. There is no semblance of logic, the scenes are randomly strung together, the acting is tired, the fight scenes are WAAYYY too long and tedious, and I amd tired of listening to japanese bartenders who double as zen masters when business is slow.Bad people did bad things to the heroine. She goes on a globetrotting mission to get even. But does it have to drag so interminably so? Does blood really gush like 10 fire hydrants from a severed limb? The sets are tacky beyond wildest belief. The acting is coarse. The storyline is hackneyed and worn threadbare. There is nothing here that hasn't been told in the previous movies. The zen is of the mumbo jumbo 2-minute ramen variety that is laughable at the very least.There are logical chasms here that you could drop the Titanic into. Examples - A strapping 10 foot guy tries to rape a comatose girl in her hospital bed who has been vegetating and atrophying on life support for 4 years. And she bites his tongue off and wrestles him to death. And then she kills the nurse - another able bodied guy by repeatedly banging a door on his head. All this seconds after she snaps out of her 4-year coma. Then she gets into a truck and drives off. Then she gets on a flight to Japan and gets a samurai sword from a bartender. Then she singlehandedly slaughters about 50 Japanese samurai in one go, all armed with heavy duty swords themselves(I guess they were fresh out of bullets in Japan) ...ok, you get it. This is bilge of the highest quality.The one good thing about this movie is that it just saved me spending eight dollars to watch Kill Bill 2. I will probably watch it when it comes out on video. Or better perhaps when it ever gets picked up by TBS or TNT :-) My advice to you is to do the same.	1.0	The Big Sleep	2004-05-11	24	9	15
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A11W7SFEXY5YEE	"O.C.T. TX ""Wesley"""	Quentin Tarintino does it again. He releases a movie with extreme violence and harsh language. This time it is Kill Bill Volume 1. It is a story of an assassin (Uma Thurmin) who is betrayed by her boss and fellow assassins. The Bride (Uma's Nickname in the movie) spends the rest of the movie out to get revenge on those who betrayed her. There are several bloody scenes in this movie. So don't let the small children take a peek. Several of the scenes are comical especailly when people's heads get chopped off, and an unrealistic amount of blood squirts out. There is a whole lot of action in this movie, lot's of kung-fu violence that will keep you at the edge of your seat. One of my favorite moments is the first fight scene where The Bride fights the character played by Vivica A Fox. It's hilarious when Vivica's daughter walks in on them fighting and the two of them are standing there a bloody mess. The fight scenes near the end are very good too. This movie is great for any action movie fan and I recommend it for any blood thirsty movie fan.	4.0	Crazy Movie	2006-01-23	3	3	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A12CUOYPW2QM91	"Omar Khan ""RW"""	"Most film makers seem to get their recognition through one film that they make.  The one film that breaks them out of the ambiguity of the back-studio system and into the limelight.  Of course, these film makers are then judged by that one film.  That being said, I shall begin this by saying don't expect another ""Pulp Fiction"" in ""Kill Bill,"" this is an entirely DIFFERENT film, and that is not a good thing...it is a great thing.To stick to my usual way of doing reviews, let us start with the plot...it's right there in the title.  Uma Thurman is ""The Bride,"" a former assasin for the Deadly Viper Assasination Squad (DiVAS).  When her previous employer, Bill (David Caradine) and her former co-workers (Darryl Hannah, Vivica A. Fox, Lucy Liu, and Michael Madsen) put a bullet in her head on her wedding day, she sets out to kill Bill, and anyone else foolish enough to get in her way.  What begins is a highly stylized, non linear, revenge story.The story-telling is the usual Tarantino slickness; a sense of self-absorbed cool and arrogance that he has become known for.  It really works wonders with this story, surprisingly.  To its core, ""Kill Bill"" is a 21st century grindhouse film, but the way the story is told, it's just so unexpected it's refreshing.The actors seemed to have fun with this movie.  That is good, because the audience should have fun with the movie as well.  So when the actor and audience (and I'm pretty sure the director) is having a grand ole time with this movie, nothing bad can come out of it.  None of the actors are wasting camera time and they all bring out their own sense of swankiness to an already cool atmosphere.  You feel the Bride's pain, you associate with O-Ren Ishii's past, you hate Bill, it all works very well.The music, like his other films, have the Tarantino touch.  Specified tracks from yesteryear mixed with a weird techno/hip hop/heavy metal/Asian feel.  It serves right up there with the film's collaboration with multiple genres.The camera work is gorgeous.  I'm not just talking about the fight scenes.  Tarantino seems to borrow heavily from the Asian feel of his film.  The camera seems to go everywhere in every little place.  One particular scene follows every little action in a Japanese restaurant that I was wondering through out the whole time where the camera was actually placed to get all these different angles.I especially loved the scenary.  The world of ""Kill Bill"" cannot exist anywhere on Earth, it's impossible.  All the colors, the textures, the environment that each character claims their own, it's all so exotic.  Once again, borrowing the ""mysticism of the east,"" only planting it everywhere in this movie.  Wow.  A nice touch of escapism from what would be boring reality.The choreography was excellent.  The trailer alone is nothing compared to the full movie experience.  Believe me, this will leave you gasping for air.The multi-genre works out better than I first anticipated in this movie.  The usage of speghitti western close-ups, with seemingly seventies music, along with martial arts, equals a cocktail any true movie fan can appreciate.  Also, the use of black and white, spurting blood, beeping out The Bride's real name whenever it's uttered, and that anime sequence, every convention works in this film.  It's godlike.I guess my only gripe about ""Kill Bill"" was it not to have been cut in two parts.  However, with the sheer exhiliration of ""Volume One,"" I think I might need this cool down period before the conclusion.In the end, with equal parts tributes to samurai, spaghetti westerns, kung fu, anime, and blaxploitation films, this is old-school art at its finest.  ""Kill Bill"" is a roller coaster ride, as in it is not for the squemish, and those who go on it will feel ultimatly rewarded for doing so.  Oh, and if you don't like it, it's perfectly alright, then the movie wasn't meant for you.  Like Quentin's other films, this movie offers up to one true audience; the true lovers of cinema.-RW"	5.0	"Thrilling ""Bill,"" Tarantino Does it Again"	2003-10-14	3	2	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1OW6AQWJTO187	oncerest	I was so excited and happy to see this kind of good action and revenge movie. The movie's pilot is pretty simple, bad guys deserve to be revenged and die. But the director tell the story in a refreshing and beautiful way. The action scence feel so real how they make it even though I don't expect to see it in real life. It is a very good direction for action and kongfu movie. No other lame movies just make a kongfu a joke, or try to figure out how people can fight with machine.Only one thing totall looks not real, how she can bring such a big knife on plane?	5.0	It has been a long time to see such a refreshing moive	2004-04-17	3	3	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A37G6UPLDGH81P	"Ookami ""daronin"""	"I got dragged to this film, by a few friends.  I dont typically like terrentino's over the top style of film-making.  Not since Pulp Fiction have I ever really appreciated his obvious talent.  But then, something happened...  During the credits, I saw a name that is akin to a long lost friend... A name i always look forward to seeing; Yuen Woo Ping was listed as fight Director during the openning credits.  The Man that taught Keanu Reeves Kung fu, the man that made Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yung Fat Fly in crouching tiger, one of the most skilled fight coordinators working in movies today.  I had a feeling I was going to like this film.And I did.  The plot is simple, a Woman We know only as ""The Bride"" Is asassinated on her wedding day.  Once a member of the Deadly viper Asassination Squad (DiVAS), she left the team for unknown reasons, and married a man that was not the father of her baby.  The wedding party, and groom, are mercilessly gunned down.  She is mercilessly beaten by her former teammates, and shot in the head by the leader of the Asassins.  A man we know only as; Bill.  The true father of the brides baby, which we learn just a moment before Bill shoots her in the head.  Miraculously, she survives.  Albeit, in a coma.  One of her would-be killers visits the hospital too poison her and finish the job, but is stopped by a cell phone call by Bill.  He appreciates her toughness, and wants to leave her alive.  Which, was a mistake.The Bride Wakes up four years later.  And is not happy, after taking a suitbly brutal revenge on a orderly that sold her comatose body to friends as a sexual plaything, she steals his car, and leaves on a mission of revenge.  Thats all the backstory there is on her.Like Pulp Ficion, Kill Bill is a movie whose episodes take place outside a normal time line.  The first scene is The Bride visiting one of her attackers in her suburban home, and initiating a brutal kung-fu themed catfight to the Death.  But because of the storytelling dynamic, the first target we see her kill, is the Second she has killed.Her first target, is the DiVA known as Cottonmouth.  A yakuza female crime lord named O-Ren-Ishi (played by lucy liu).  O-Ren's background is revealed in a pseudo-anime style sequance detaling the murder of her family when she was 9 years old, her revenge as an 11 year old, and her eventual rise as an asassin and finishing with O-Rens ascension as Yakuza crime lord.  Its good too see Some of the villans Being fleshed out, with a interesting backstory that could have been made into a film itself.  Also, O-Ren has a entourage aslo worthy of feature film status.  A Gneral that leads her yakuza army that all wear kato masks from 60's tv Series Green Hornet, A Bodyguard that is obviously modeled after various anime, her name is Go-Go Yubari.  A Sixteen year old asassin, who is cute and sexy as a button in her Japanese school girl outfit, speaks with a girlish voice, fights like a she-demon, and is psychotic as homemade sin.  Rounding out O-Rens entourage is her asisstant, Sophie.  A french japanese woman that chatted sweetly on a phone while overlooking  the bride's vicious beating.It is the story of O-Ren, Her Entourage, and how the Bride takes revenge on them that makes up most of Kill Bill Vol 1.  There is a entertaining sequance, in which The Bride visits a retired swordsmith, now working as a sushi chef, who we also find was Bills Master in his younger days.  after this, the story is set up, The Bride is sufficently trained and vengence-starved, and what follows is a Sumptuous fight sequance of swords, fist, feet, and other various objects, that is a mix of Sonny Chibas Japanese sensitivities (karate, kendo) Yuen Wu Pings Kung fu choreography (fighting on tables, banisters, intricate and fascinating choregraphed exchanges) and Tarrentinos requisite over the top violance, with blood splattering with every swing of the sword, until the restraunt where the fight takes place, is more akin to a crimson shower.  The arterial spray is so exageratted and over the top, that after the 10th bad guy had a arm chopped off and sprayed blood ten feet in all directions, i didnt know whether too laugh at its increduality, or yawn.But despite Tarrentinos lack of self control concerning bloodshid, sonny chibs sensibilities when it comes too samurai themed action, contribute to a wonderful final fight Between O-Ren-Ishi, and The Bride.  It is this three man tag team of talent, that make Kill Bill So original.  It is less a hollywood feature, and more like a good old fashioned hong kong theatrical presenation.  Since most of the film is fight scenes, or takes place in a japanese setting, its obvious that Sonny Chiba and Yuen Woo Ping, helped Tarrentino alot to make the scenes as credible, and entertaining as possible.Also, honestly, if  you think Ive given too much plot, as yourself this.  It has been widely advertised that Tarrentino crafted this film as  a homage to kung fu movies from greats like the Shaw Brothers (Five Deadly Venoms).  Each one of these films often followed a plot so flimsy, it could have been a hallmark card.  We all know where The Bride will go, and what she will do.  But its worth noting, that the journey is one that any moviegoer that Has an appreciation for Hong Kong or Japanese Cinema will want to take with her.Indeed, I have read that for part two (out in febuary of 2004), tarrentino scaled back the japanee, chinese, and martial arts themes, in exchange for more character development.  I hope the loss of these themes isnt too noticeable, for they helped to make this film sort of an Un-tarrentino film.  The mixing of american, japanese, and hong kong direction, is a truly fulfilling one.  Instead of amusing dialouge and over the top gory violance, we have amusing dialouge, over the top comical, yet gory violance, and noticeable Hong Kong and japanese theatre touches.  I hope that none of these are absent for Vol. 2.  Or they will be sorely missed."	5.0	I guess Overkill Bill was a bit too self-effaciating	2003-10-13	5	2	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A92XVSV8LADWZ	Otto Yuen	This is the most extremely bloody violence film I have ever seen before. Storyline is very simple but the resulting effects are hugely successful. Tarantino must have too much japanese Shadow Warriors (Sonny Chiba) and KungFung (David Carradine) TV series, as well as HongKong's martial arts (Gordon Liu) movies. Obviously, Kill Bill carries lots of elements from those voilence movies & animations. Chopping humen heads, arms, legs off, bleeding like a jet stream. Going for extreme bloody but in contrast, not gross at all. There're lots of fighting scenes one by one without giving you any spare time for restroom. Tarantino carefully plans to show audiences extreme violence via animation way ahead of the real people getting heads chopped off. Making sure we're all well psycholoically prepared before watching the real people heads off, arms off, and legs off when the bride swinging her samurai sword. The other great element to help & drive the atomsphere to the peak is the smart way of using various music sound tracks. Feel like watching horrible movie. Excellent result!

I eventually saw the trailer during some movie and I got goosebumps!  Then the day came, I went to the movies and saw a masterpiece.  I've always regarded Resevoir Dogs as the best Tarantino movie, but not anymore!!!  All I can say about this movie is that it has perfect balance!  It has all the ingredients of a great movie.  Uma Thurman dazzled me with her gutsy performance, both physical and emotional.  The hospital scene where she wakes up and finds out about her baby was soooo convincing, I almost felt guilty, I truly felt bad for THE BRIDE.  Plus all the action she does in the movie is just amazing!  My vote is for Uma Thurman, best actress, and she deserves it.  I saw this movie 9 times in the first week....it's that good.  Till next time, I'll be waiting.	5.0	Best film of 2003!!!	2004-01-22	5	1	4

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	Yeeaaaahh!!!Without a doubt Tarantino has set out to make the kind of movie that HE wants to see - and you should be glad that the studio has let him have his way. So if you are movie buff then you will be in heaven for the next two hours. However mainstream cinema goers may shy away from the heavy amounts of splatter violence, themes of extremely bad taste and what seems to be a very shallow plot.First of all, Kill Bill is comprised of several different genres and themes stemming from femme fatal, the Yakuza, Spaghetti Westerns, Kick Boxer, Japanese Manga Anime, Lone Wolf and Cub, and Star Trek! Essentially the plot is simple. Uma Thurman plays a woman called **** a.k.a Black Mamba who is avenging the death or her unborn child after her wedding massacre. There seems to be some past employment link between her and a mafia of trained assassins led by an unseen Bill (David Carradine) and this is revealed in flashback style as **** goes about seeking her revenge. All of the characters have a background which is fleshed out visually during lots of these various flashback pieces that are extremely bloody and graphically violent in nature. In fact Kill Bill looks likely too be one of the most goriest movies ever made... however it is also extremely funny. There are so many taboo elements brought up like pedophilia, coma patient rape, parents graphically murdered in front of their children and women killing other women (Extremely violently I might add) but Tarantino manages to make us laugh at these things every other five minutes. Seriously - this film makes fun of all the things that you would generally shy away from even under the influence of a few bottles of saki. It is an extremely black violent comedy in many ways, but at the same time you can not help sitting there in awe as Tarantino pulls out every trick in the book and then some more. The Manga type cartoon in the middle will either turn you off or blow your mind... it sure did mine!The ending is a real cliff-hanger and although this is not Tarantinos best film by a long shot it is certainly his most ambitious work to date - if not one of the most ambitious films this century.By the way - did I mention that the film was extremely bloody? The GORE and I mean G O R E on display here is like nothing you have ever seen before. There is a shot of the Japanese club after a violent wake in what has to be one of the most longest and bloody battle sequences ever filmed. You have never seen anything like it, nor will you again.The are some downsides to the film. The end fight sequence has too many pauses and some parts do drag on for five minutes more than they should which leads us to suspect that pieces of this film have been extended to help make up for the running time of what is a film of two parts. However these misgivings are easily cast aside by the sheer energy that is on display here. So if you got the stomach for it then you know what to do - Go watch the killing of Bill.Role on the bloody part deux!	5.0	Ubber-Ultra-Violence meets Cinematic Advancement	2003-11-20	6	5	1

However, &quot;Kill Bill, Volume 1&quot; has all of the pieces I remember from my youth, watching any old martial arts films or shows I could find.  An &quot;homage&quot; film in it's purest and most un-apologetic form, &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is true to the craft and cuts no corners.  The soundtrack is fabulous, and the movie plays like live-action anime.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1NUDHU6HSLVEY	Peazfool	"Kill Bill is the most distasteful movie Quentin Tarantino has ever done. From the unnecessary gore to the artless battle scenes that directly copied Japanese Manga, Mr. Tarantino has really categorized himself as one of the worst fall-from-grace directors of all time. Pulp Fiction was a cult classic, there is no doubt about it, even the Oscars recognized Quentin's talent, but Kill Bill probably stinks more than a jockstrap filled with onions. Despite its great reviews from blood sucking critics, I thought it was a horrible movie. It was bloody. It was boring. It was corny. And if the high-wattage name of Quentin Tarantino was to make this flick an artistic masterpiece, it failed.First there is the title card with the quote ""Revenge is a dish best served cold,"" followed by the attribution ""old Klingon proverb."" Which sometimes does lead the audience to think that the story will dig deeper and include rounded characterization as well as splendid film plot, but it doesn't. Taratino's new film does not portray revenge as a deep and powerful emotion, but rather as just a thing you should do when someone wrongs you. All the characters will remain flat, as Taratino's new film is just an ""Itchy and Scratchy"" story played by famous actresses. Hate and revenge are the only themes involved in the storyline and neither is portrayed with great depth.In the first scene, the story (as in most Tarantino movies) starts at the end. The viewer is immediately placed into the action as we witness a pregnant bride (Uma Thurman) bloody, surrounded by the corpses of her wedding party, and pleading for her life before she is shot in the head. The voice of a faceless man is introduced, and is the one that shoots Uma in the head. But anyone who has seen the previews knows who Bill (David Carradine) is, and remembers the voice that used to fill the old Kung Fu series, so the element of surprise is never there when we are introduced to Bill's true identity later on. Of course, as with any clich&eacute;, the hero doesn't die -- and four years later she is out for revenge.It is also interesting to note that Taratino's new film is viewed in chapters instead of a stream of connection plots. I don't know if this is because Taratino is paying tribute to the Kill Bill Manga (Japanese cartoon) series, but it seems like just another bad attempt at being original. I should also note that perhaps Taratino is using this particular format to ""cut to the chase"" better than most other action movies. But who really cares.Back to the story, the main character's (Uma Thurman) only goal in the movie is introduced early. Well actually, it is introduced in the title - Kill Bill. But first, she has to find Bill. The viewer is introduced to Bill's little gang of assassins. The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad consists of five most deadly killers, led by Bill. There is O'Ren-Ishii as Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu), Elle Driver as California Mountain Snake, Vernita Green as Copperhead (Vivica A Fox), Budd as Sidewinder. And there is The Bride (Uma Thurman), whose name is not spoken.Uma Thurman battles out with a Copperhead aka Vivica A Fox. The audience is introduced to her in a surreal sequence of events that will set the tone for the rest of the film. Although Vivica's character does include a certain depth, Vivica's love for her daughter does not ever come to the surface, and even when it does, her lines are filled with sarcasm that leads the crowd to laugh rather than to understand her position. I think it is interesting to note that Uma did not kill Copperhead's daughter while Copperhead had no problem killing Uma's daughter, It's also interesting to note that Uma Thurman's character had a baby, and ""lost"" it and Copperhead has a daughter and she is four. Which could lead the viewer to think that maybe Copperhead took care of Uma's daughter this whole time and the second film is going to include a more in depth conflict between mother and daughter. Because the daughter thinks Copperhead is her real mother and did see Uma kill her ""mother.""Uma kills Copperhead and is set out to go to Japan to battle ex-Viper O-Ren (Lucy Liu) and her army of yakuza in a Tokyo dancehall. Asian movie references abound. Taratino honors Sonny Chiba (the very famous Japanese actor) by giving the Japanese movie hero a very substantial role in which he describing O-Ren's violent origins, in Japanese anim&eacute;. I personally thought that the anime version should have been cut but realized that no moviegoer would have liked to see a child actor commit so much bloody homicide. (Especially a girl) Tarantino also honors Bruce Lee by employing ""The Green Hornet"" theme and putting O-Ren's yakuza in Kato-like masks and the final battle scene with Bruce Lee's yellow striped costume. And when The Bride flies into Tokyo, it's not a real Tokyo -- it's a model Tokyo that looks only minutes away from a Godzilla visitation.The copious violence, climaxing in fire hoses of blood gushing from arms and legs in the dancehall fight, is so removed from reality -- and, in a sop to the MPAA, partly shown in black-and-white -- that they turn comical. Some scenes, chiefly a gratuitously nasty bit involving a hospital orderly who pimps The Bride's still-comatose body, are not so easily dismissed as cinematic excess.Thurman gives a spectacular ""physical"" performance; slashing and dicing probably took hours of choreography and hundreds of hours of practice. Uma's throws her 5-foot-11 self into the demanding fight scenes opposite Liu. But there's not much to say for Thurman's mental performance. She's angry, she fights, she kills, end of story.In my opinion, some of the highest points of the movie where during the scenes with Japanese legend Sonny Chiba, filled with humor and beauty. It also incorporates a western style of hatred and aggression into an eastern style of seeing fighting as art rather than ruthless violence. Sonny's swords are a sight to see. Another good scene was the final scene with Lucy Liu, as Uma steps out of the tumulus restaurant only to find a peaceful and beautiful snowy setting. Of course then there's more fighting and blood and senseless violence. But oh well."	2.0	unneccessary	2006-11-19	11	5	6

I have been watching films for more than thirty years, so I know what a good film is and I'm sure, ""Kill Bill I, and Kill Bill II"", are not good films in any way. Nobody can even call this film alternative, I'm sure this is a complete ""Nothing""! It's a total lack of creativity, ridiculous script, the only one good thing here is the real beauty of Uma Thurman. First time I watched this film I had to watch ""Saving Private Ryan"" after to forget the waste of time I had just done. In my opinion Tarantino is the great deceiver of all movie industry.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A148IXFQ07X9Q4	Pete R	"Kill Bill Volume 1 is a cinematic masterpiece. Its the most exciting and daring Hollywood film I've personally ever seen in my life. 60s/70s Grindhouse Cinema is Kill Bill's roots, but as those roots grew they transformed into something brand new that Ive never seen before in a movie.The film is a work of cinematic art only a guy named Quentin Tarantino could create. A cinema lover long obsessed with the pop art films of Sergio Leone, Brian DePalma, Chang Cheh, Lucio Fulci, Kenji Fukasaku and Mario Bava to just name a select few. A guy who loved the down and dirty Grindhouse-Drive In films of the 1960s and 1970s growing up. Tarantino has created something that has surpassed the original written script (which I read and LOVED). The visuals along with the music will boil your adrenaline. Kill Bill is a testament to what a true love of cinema can bring to the screen. As opposed to popular belief, Its NOT about making the AFI Top 100 List or winning shiny awards. Its about LOVING CINEMA in all its forms. Thats EXACTLY what you get when you pay to see a Tarantino film.The Kill Bill story is very simple. Its the standard spaghetti western or kung fu Revenge plot. But that ""plot"" is only the framework to hold something much richer and deeper. You could say Kill Bill is an exercise in highly stylized cinema, and it DEFINITELY is that, but Tarantino has also brought something else to it: Heart and Soul.Kill Bill has audible languages in it (including Japanese), but the one language that QT speaks fluently and perfectly himself is the language of cinema. Its in every shot, every scene. Running through the film like a river.Kill Bill deserves all its praise and for real film fans like myself, its great to see someone in love with making movies as much as Tarantino."	5.0	A Cinema Masterpiece	2003-11-26	3	1	2

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1D3XQC2DIT	Peter Shermeta	Of the two times I sat down to watch Kill Bill Volume 1, I can say that I only fell asleep once. Watching it for the first time, I never realized how slow the story is. I actually used to make excuses about how tired I was that day I fell asleep rather than seeing what really happened. There is some amazing action in Kill Bill Volume 1, but it is neatly bundled into only a few scenes. Those scenes were great, and the marriage between live action scenes and anime shorts worked very well.The movie was pretty funny, more so than I had expected. The humor was in the writing in some parts, but also in just how ridiculously bloody the fight scenes were. Think of Kill Bill Volume 1 as a cross between Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Evil Dead. From Crouching Tiger we see the live action fight scenes choreographed like Japanese anime cartoons. From Evil Dead we get high-pressured spouts of blood coming from every slash and cut.The language is not the best, but it is the fight scenes that would probably prevent you from showing this movie to young children and the squeemish.Kill Bill Volume 1 was good, but not great. I am hoping that it will gain favor with me when I see Volume 2. I have heard that they really must regarded as two parts of a whole and that it is unfair to judge them separately.Get yourself a large caffeinated beverage and enjoy Kill Bill Volume 1. That is unless my suspicions are correct and I am actually the last person to see this movie.	4.0	Better than I had expected	2007-01-11	2	0	2

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3S0IVFM83ZSE7	P. Hardy	"Kill Bill: VOL.1 is an all right movie, that supposedly pays homage to older Japanese flicks of the past and spaghetti westerns later on in Vol.2. However, with all the hype that was going around this movie I was not expecting it to be any good, because; A): I'm not fan of this Quentin Tarantino directior of ""Jackie Brown"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" among other movies he directed in the 1990s or earlier (I was just a kid and I didn't like them). and B): Uma Thurman is not my favorite actress, nor someone I would've chosen to be the ""Bride""/B. Kiddo. So When I bought the movie I bought it for one thing; the fight scene concerning the bride vs. Gogo, the swordsmen in dressed in black suits and Copperhead vs. The bride. Aside from that, the storyline and plot for the movie is flimsy at best. I would explain it but the storyline is just to tedious to even write about (color me lazy all you want), but I'll do it anyway. The simple way is that a woman whose name is bleeped out during the movie, only known as ""THE BRIDE"" wakes from her four year coma and realizes she is no longer pregnant with her child and wants to exact revenge on her former partners (all codenamed after Snakes) after years of slumber for a wrong doing done to her.The first person she goes to is Vernita Green's (Copperhead) house and starts beating the holy crap out of her. However, the Bride and Green's battle is postponed when Green's daughter arrives from school a little earlier than expected. From there, the movie becomes a bore fest, but you'll soon be thanking DVD players for fast forward. Vivica A. Fox's character (probably the best next to Elle Driver) was killed maybe fourteen minutes into the movie after a short-lived and unexciting battle between Vernita Green (copperhead) and The Bride. The movie progresses from there in the format of the Bride's flashback presented in chapters that explained everything that had happened to her after waking from a bullet induced coma (including a needless background story for Lucy Liu's character O-Ren Ishii presented in crummy cartoon art, which made me wonder why they didn't do that with all the other characters the movie focused on), her trip to Japan to talk a retired blacksmith into making her a sword for her, up to the point where she heads to Tokyo to exact revenge on O-Ren Ishii (cottonmouth) is when the movie got majorly boring. After the bride beats the living crap out of the girl in the school uniform and the swordsman in black suits, the battle between Thurman and Liu (which was supposed to be the big fight in the movie) ended up being as boring as the flashbacks before it.However, when you compare that fight to the two previous ones --- its going to look pretty stupid (I laughed when Lucy Lu lost her the top of her head, though). And that's basically the entire movie in a whole. Most of the music in the movie is cheesy, but it has its great moments (1): The scene in which the camera is up close on Uma's face (shudders) and this strange assortment of sounds strung together is playing in the back ground: I call it ""Angry music."" (2): When the Bride calls out O-Ren while holding the woman who works for her hostage. That piece of music was nicely done and that was about it. Lastly the overkill with the loss of limbs and all the blood was basically the big drawer of the movie, but like someone said ""You see on limb and bout of blood, you've seen it all,""; I enjoyed the movie only for its fights and two pieces of music, other than that this movie is pretty lame in terms of good writing, characters (exlcuding Vernita Green and Elle Driver), and storyline. ------- [a 3 out of 5]"	3.0	Its an alright	2005-07-03	1	0	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A13DQTXG02HZC1	Ping Lim	Watching this movie is such a joy; especially for those of us who are movie buffs and have had watched martial arts and samurai movies.  With the advent of digital technology, computer has taken over the art of making movie: Matrix trilogy, Jurrasic Park franchise, Terminator trilogy being some examples.  It doesn't mean that lesser technology movies are faring worse than those examples illustrated.  With a good script, good direction, good idea, good team behind you, a movie can also kick arse without blowing the budget.  This movie is obviously a labour of love for Quentin.  It's really wonderful sitting through the bonus material regarding the making of this movie.  I strongly recommend viewers to watch them so that you have an in-depth understanding of where Quentin gets his inspiration from.  In this movie, Quentin pays respect to those stars of yesteryears such as Sonny Chiba (famous for his black &amp; white samurai films), Gordon Liu (famous for his Shaw Brothers' martial arts movies) by having them in this movie.  Nowadays, it's not common for movies to change the way movies are shown.  However, this movie has everything: from black &amp; white samurai style to Japanese manga style(!!!) to spagetti western style to all-out martial arts style to Brian de Palma's split screen style (just for a bit of fun, in Quentin's own word) to 70's Shaft style to Quentin's unique colourful dialogue style.  And it's amazing how seamless the transition is from one another.  Quentin commented that he felt home when he made this movie in Japan and China but felt like he was on location when he gotten back to the States, a display of how much he adores the cultures that shapes him into the Director that he is today.  Never a moment I feel that Quentin is making a violent movie for the sake of it but for the FUN of it.  He's a different cattle of fish compared with Oliver Stone.  I can't wait for the second offering, that's for sure.  Highly recommended.  By the way, the soundtrack provided by Wu-Tang Clan's producer, RZA (I think) is pertinent and effective here.  Again, a labour of love for him too.	4.0	You can have the cake &amp; eat it too!	2004-05-02	2	2	0

I haven't been one who enjoys Hong Kong flicks or Samurai movies from Japan.  But after seeing this my horizon has been opened up.  I have like anime, Miyazaki is one of my all time favorite directors.  But after seeing this movie.  I took a closer look at Kurosawa movies, even though they aren't exactly the make influence, but I see them in Kill Bill.  Also I love the touch of Italian Westerns in this movie.  The soundtrack is the best out there.  So many tunes I've never heard or heard like that!  I have seen this movie once in theaters, but I will buy the dvd when it comes out.  I will see Kill Bill Vol. 2 and I will buy it on dvd.  Then I will buy the dvd box set of them both with a really great bonus I heard will be with it!!  If you thought the Matrix Series sucked, or you just didn't get it.  Don't see this, I don't think it will help you.  I suggest go see Message in a Bottle.  You'll probably like that.  Yeah, that sounds good to me.  You'll enjoy it!!  Who can't, Kevin Costner is in it!!  Or if you want a voilent movie I suggest you see Cabin Fever.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2U5ZLO2H5KTGC	"""plastiksun"""	"The film is a blood drenched, tongue-in-cheek, feminist kung-fu revenge flick, whose best moments are cold-blooded and heartbreaking, all at the same time. The fight scenes are forgettable, despite their extravagance, if only because the ""volume 1"" in the movie's title promises that our fearless heroine will not die before the sequel hits theaters early 2004. In other words, Quentin Tarantino is cutting off heads and spraying blood all over the camera, simply because he wants to and can. Only once do we worry about our heroine's fate -- despite knowing her fate -- during her battle with Go-Go, a sexy, yet threatening, femme fatale gowned in a schoolgirl uniform, and armed with a lethal ball and chain.Consistently, Quentin Tarantino manages to treat the battles between The Bride and her opponents like a bad pay-per-view Mike Tyson fight: while it is inevitable that The Bride will win, Tarantino unfortunately kills the villains too quickly and pathetically. We want our money back when they're over, you know? The movie's longest battle, which is between The Bride and the Crazy 88 gang (88 isn't just a name, fellahs), is simply too over-the top to warrant our affection.Unfortunately, the more melancholic passages - the best passages -- are relegated to the first half of the film and are never played with again. Maybe the sequel - hopefully the sequel - will trade the over-the-top action sequences found abundant here for more witty dialogue and affecting drama.The film's dull second half is violent, bloody, and just kidding. Lucy Liu stars as one of The Bride's many nemeses and is never really believable. The film ends with a line of dialogue that will influence its entertained viewers to create a time machine to shuttle them straight to the day that volume 2 opens theatrically. For folks like me though, we'll just wait,  patiently, and hope that Tarantino gives us more of the emotionally powerful stuff that made his first installment bearable."	2.0	The 1st half is better than the dull 2nd half	2004-02-08	50	7	43

Well, even if you just see the first part, it's worth the money.Tarantino brings together all the elements: Action, suspence, acting, dialogue, and of course music. Most movies are filmed and the music is added on later, but Tarantino sets up each scene to last as long as each song on the soundtrack, making the movie into a series of music videos.And the over-the-top martial arts sequences blow ""The Matrix"" out of the water. Any fan of Tarantino, or martial arts movies, or good movie soundtracks, needs to own this movie.(Of course, I'm holding out to get Vol. 1 and 2 together in one box -- but if you missed Vol. 1 in the theater, you should definitely get the DVD, then see Vol. 2 in the theater.)"	4.0	Best movie of 2003	2004-04-02	2	1	1

While Uma Thurman is commanding in the lead role of the vengeful &quot;Bride&quot;, Mr. Tarantino is the star of the film.  Kill Bill is a visual roller coaster. Mr. Tarantino deftly mixes black &amp; white, color &amp; animation from his palate to paint a visual piece of art.  Mr. Tarantino has sometimes been accused of being something of a plagiarist in his films and in Kill Bill he invokes kung fu, spaghetti westerns, Saturday matinee cliffhangers and Japanese anime genres.  But instead of just copying, he molds them into his own unique vision.  The script is laced with typical snappy Tarantino dialogue and, as with his first three films, music plays a large part.  Mr. Tarantino uses Nancy Sinatra's somber version of &quot;Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)&quot; to perfectly set the mood for the film and the RZA's haunting score adds depth and feeling throughout.  The film is quite violent and brutal.  There are decapitations, hundreds of limbs being chopped off and countless bloody deaths, but they are necessary to the film.  The violence is somewhat cartoonish, when one character is decapitated, blood flows out like a fountain from his neck and when an arm is cut off, blood rushes out in an obscenely fast manner.  After a long absence from directing, Kill Bill, Vol. 1 is a most welcomed return from one of the few truly original directors in film today.	5.0	Bill Is A Thrill	2004-06-03	3	2	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3EVO4DEUZ2P67	poppejam	"Tarantino teams with Uma Thurman to invent one of the coolest characters I think I have ever seen in any movie to date. 2003's ""Kill Bill"" is one of the best films of this year if not of all-time and it's a damn shame that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences is too conservative to realize how great it is.Uma Thurman stars as ""The Bride"" (her real name is actually bleeped out whenever it's uttered) and she's pissed as hell. She is a former assassin apparently on the verge of getting married after running away to restart her life after discovering that she is carrying her boss's baby...only her boss, ""Bill"" (David Carridine) finds out and sends her former teammates to gun her down at the chapel...but wait, that's just the beginning of the story. And it's brilliantly retold, short and to the point, in a grainy black-and-white two-minute sequence at the film's introduction. Bill is yet to be revealed. All we hear is his voice; soothing, yet dark and foreboding...and all we can see is The Bride's pained face as she lies on the floor, sweating profusely and bleeding to death. She tries to tell Bill that she is pregnant with his child and it's cut off by a bullet to her head.If you are trying to make sense of anything I have told you thus far, don't. If you think I've given too much away, I haven't. You see, The Bride WILL kill everyone she has set out to kill because that's her motivation. Thurman's character is practically invincible with the skills of the greatest martial arts fighter in the world and the momentum of a Mac truck. It's HOW she kills that provides you with surprise and suspense. And if you're thinking that this is a self-indulgent gore-fest with no plot, you're very much incorrect.The Bride is smart and cunning and you identify with her cause. More so, I would imagine, if you were a woman watching this movie. In fact, you can't call Tarantino sexist or mysoginist because almost every female character he writes is intelligent (save for Bridget Fonda's character in Jackie Brown, but Tarantino adapted the character from the book, so that doesn't count) and has the ability to play on the same field as men. In fact, Bill's entire staff of killers, save for Budd, is a female so, technically, this is a chick flick but a chick flick lovingly dedicated to a group of women with their arms held aloft with pride and conviction and Uma leading the charge with a sharp sword and a bad attitude.Like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, this movie is presented in ""chapters"", making it feel like you're watching a great epic novel come to life in front of your eyes. Each chapter introduces a character, or a backstory told in different types of media. A few examples of this: The Bride's death is recorded in black-and-white as if you are watching history unfold, O-Ren Ishii's twisted origin is Japanese hardcore hentai anime, and characters fight in silhouette against giant screens that, at once, turn red, then blue.These are truly epic moments told with truly epic style and fashion with giant doses of wit and flair added for good measure. An example is one of my favorite exchanges in the film is between The Bride and O-Ren after The Bride has mowed down O-Ren's gang of fighters (nicknamed ""The Crazy 88""):O-Ren: ""Silly caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords. You didn't think it would be that easy did you?""The Bride: ""Actually, for a second there...yeah...I kinda did.""O-Ren: ""Silly Rabbit...""The Bride and O-Ren (at the same time): ""Tricks are for kids...""Or the soft-spoken and very solemn bragging coming from master swordmaker, Hatori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba of ""The Street Fighter"", one of Tarantino's favorite martial-arts films):Hanzo: ""This is my finest sword. Should you encounter God in your travels, God will be cut.""The humor injected into each scene makes the fights following them seem all the more deadly and enticing and dramatic. Swords ring and slice, knifes cut through the air, bullets boom, women spit venom into the word, ""b***h"" whenever they trash-talk, and the blood...oh, yes...I did forget to mention the gallons upon gallons of blood, didn't I? Violent? Well, I still defend this film against those who say that violence is only justified in films regarding religion, mainly because while this movie is violent, you're really not supposed to be taking it seriously. I find it hard to believe that when someone gets a belly-full of sword, then has that sword removed from their belly, that all the blood they carry flies forth as if the stab-victim has a pressurized water cannon readilly installed in their stomach. It's violent...but it's outrageously violent and in that way, that is where the movie gets its charm. Sure, it's pretty dark charm, but it's charm nonetheless.The great amount of detail that Quentin Tarantino has applied to this film is unbelievable. He borrows from old Sergio Leone westerns, 60's martial-arts movies, action films, anime, and great sweeping dramas. The only genre that Tarantino leaves untouched is the movie-musical and science-fiction although, one would suspect that if Tarantino had enough time, he would cover those, too. I could almost imagine Tarantino ressurecting the acting career of Mark Hammill and casting him as a hip alien who tries to kill The Bride for killing Bill, a friend of his.How good is it?Remember that part in ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" by Tarantino's good friend, Robert Rodriguez, when Johnny Depp tells Antonio Banderas that he is so crazy for the pork dish he is eating that when he is through, he is going to walk into the kitchen and shoot the cook?Oh yes, it's that good, but I'm not shooting the cook 'cuz I want more.**** out of ****"	5.0	Butt-Kicking High Art	2004-08-09	7	4	3
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AVLZVV431RS2G	poptartassasin06	As a major fan of Quentin Tarantino's work, I was more than excited when I went to see this film in theatres. I had heard nothing but good things about. I was however a tad bit skeptical when I saw advertisements and I realized that it would be nothing like his other films I had loved so much.While I was correct in assuming that this film was nothing like his others, there was nothing to be skeptical about. This film is amazing. It is the story about Uma Thurman's character known only as 'The Bride'. After Bill and four other members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad(DiVAS) shoot up her wedding and leave her in a coma for four years, she sets out to take revenge.This is the first half of the film following The Bride as she sets her sight on her first two members of the DiVAS. It is an all out hardcore and bloody brawl that shows us a side of Quentin's abilities that we've as yet to see in any of his films thus far. While there are multiple scenes of mild, low key conversation, this film truly shines in it's well choreographed fight scenes. Another plus side is the short anime scene Quentin put in to add to the effect of the movie.Clearly not a movie for everyone (especially those with a weak stomach) but truly a sight to behold, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is yet again another amazing film that Quentin Tarantion has supplied for us to see.	5.0	Kill Bill Vol. 1	2004-04-17	1	0	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2CMYX10636NG2	Portia	"Ok. So that's not EXACTLY what Lucy Liu said in the new super-gory, super-shticky, super-kung-fu-rip-off, super-slick Tarantino film ""Kill Bill"", but if you want to know what she REALLY says, go see it.And you really should. If you're 18 or older and accompanied only by people who are not squeamish upon the sight of blood. And when we say blood, we mean several gallons per shot. One truly feels sympathy for whoever had to clean up between takes. Let's just say if it was ketchup, McDonald's would never have to reorder until somewhere around 3042.Of course, you should be expecting (and i hesitate to say this for fear of repeating every single other reviewer who has had anything to say about this film) what is essentially a parody (homage? spoof? takeoff?) of spaghetti westerns-slash-kung fu movies. Well, now that i've said that (...), and it's probably nothing you didn't already know, I'll move on to my personal feelings about this movie.I loved it. I loved the pastishe-y feel of the opening credits combined with the fabulous music (a lot of which was taken from movies...the use of the green hornets theme was great) and the eye-popping color and gorgeous shots. Toss in a couple of thousand insider kung-fu jokes that I probably didn't get, but you might, and Monty Python-style hacking of limbs (""it's only a flesh wound!!"") and you have KILL BILL.The plot is so irrelevant it's hilarious...like most kung fu movies, come to think of it. Uma Thurman looks like she's having a blast portraying the traditional revenge-obsessed, student-of-samurai, ex-bad-guy with near-superhero powers. Lucy Liu and the rest of her posse of villains (all with snake-inspired code names, of course) engage with Thurman in some of the bloodiest battle-to-the-death scenes you'll ever see in an American cinema.Some of this movie is hilarious ...like the bit when Thurman goes to get her sword specially made for her by the master in Japan and orders sake... but most of it is not really laugh out loud funny. Tarantino has an edgy sense of humor to say the least, and this film is his ""who cares if you like it, i think it's AWESOME"" message to the world.Some of the best cinematography and marriage of music-to-movie I have EVER seen is right here in this film. Some of the bits will take your breath away with their beauty-- right before someone gets their guts yoinked out of them. I did mention to leave all your squeamish friends at home, correct?But wait, I most definitely did not spend enough time gushing over how BEAUTIFUL a lot of this movie is. It is VERY beautiful. The last fight between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii (who chops first and asks questions later) is filmed in a magical wintery Japanese garden with anime-style snow.The stunts equally deserve accolades as Tarantino used incredibly minimal (by today's standards) computer magic. This is the REAL thing...people actually doing stunts instead of the nerd at the computer creating the double-back-flip out of a sequence of 0's and 1's. Just like old school kung fu!Well, enjoy for what it is...try to pick out some of the private jokes intended for all you B-action-flick junkies...and have a good night at the movies."	4.0	"""silly caucasian director likes to play with samurai movie"""	2003-10-14	5	3	2

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A19GQNQLVEAGH0	"Prince Arthas Menethil ""Frostmourne"""	Blah.... where to begin. Was it entertaining? Yeah, it was. Was it well-thought out? Hardly. Was it a bit cheesy? Definitely. Was it compelling? At first... then it's all down hill. Was it violent and packed with mindless, gory action? Absolutely, it wouldn't a Tarantino movie if it wasn't. Was it good? It was okay - two 1/2 stars.First off, I wanna say that I liked Django: Unchained (save for the impossible biased action for the hero) and I kinda enjoyed Inglorious Basterds - after I accepted that it was a revised version of history.But this film is neither of those two... but later with this.ACTING - yep, that's really the only thing I think was good about this film. Especially Uma Thurman's. She really did a great job as The Bride. You should see the first scene in the hospital. She is so believable. So real. So sad.... at first. Then the script requires for her to become this (albeit justifiably) serious kick-butt fighter that knows no fear and wins every battle that comes her way... oftentimes in the most rushed ways possible.The action choreography was ok, just ok. But the only reason action is good is because you sympathize with the fighters (good and/or bad), as well as being sucked into the story. Neither really happened here for me. I lost the connection with The Bride real fast. Hated the excessive cussing that really didn't drive the story and just became irritating. Laughed at the ridiculously unrealistic gore. Seriously, I couldn't figure out whether Tarantino was trying to make a female kick-butt action flick with some comedy.... or a ridiculously bloody comedy with female kick butt action.No, they don't work well with each other.But then again, maybe I was expecting something a little more. Or a little better. My mom loves this film so that's really how we wound up watching it, and she loves it (I prefer S.A.L.T much MUCH more). Anyway, I didn't care for it. There's a big difference between an entertaining movie and a great movie. And no they aren't the same thing to me. And yes, an entertaining movie can be bad. And YES, an entertaining movie can be a great movie, too. But this one isn't. Just a long gladiator fight with sick comedy featuring a great performance by Uma Thurman.Another thing I didn't care for is the obvious 70s/80s style. GAG! I've never liked much of the 70s/80s culture, music included(Queen a timeless exception) and it's no different here. The score was SO bad it was irritating and distracting. Had nothing to do with the scenes it appeared in. Plus, I just hate the way so many of those films from that period are just plain cheesy and comedic. Have I made it clear I don't like 70s movies? I did. Right then.Is it a movie you should watch? Absolutely. A lot of people seemed to have liked it. I certainly don't question their opinions as I'm in the minority it seems. It just didn't click with me and I don't intend to watch it again.P.S. I don't expect you to like my review, but plz comment.	2.0	I couldnt get it...	2014-04-22	1	0	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AL4S28TFRI74L	ProfessorHuggyBear	After 5 viewings, Quentin Tarantino continues to amaze me.  There are tiny aspects of the film I never caught on previous viewings.  One of my favorite is the background soundtrack of &#34;Master of the Flying Guillotine&#34; inserted during a close up of O Ren Ishi during the final confrontation inside the club.  A subtle reference only hardcore kung fu cinema junkies would catch.I also heard he changed the fight with the crazy 88's to black and white because it was so bloody it wouldn't pass the R rating otherwise.There are so many references to samurai/kung fu films that it begs a rewatch every few years.An epic film, masterfully shot, unconventionally edited, superbly written and scored by a pop culture genius.  This film is definitely not for the faint of heart.  It is oozes the essence of what a traditional samurai revenge epic once was.	5.0	Ultraviolent revenge with a masters touch	2014-04-19	0	0	0

All because they attacked her at her wedding and she thought that they killed the child that she was carrying that was Bill's.  The fighting scence in the club were great and surprising, but at the end you find out that the child isn't dead after all.

However, this was full of senseless, over the top, stupid bloody violence.  I have no idea how it ends because I felt disgusted with myself for even watching the first hour.  Tarantino apparently wanted an excuse to let Uma Thurman slice and dice as many people as she could and make some crazy blood sprays from severed limbs and heads.  It's disgusting, distasteful, and senseless.  I highly recommend that you DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.	1.0	Brutal Movie	2014-05-05	1	0	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3B1XRW9HIGYQB	P. Woods	After six years after the boring Jackie Brown (in my opinion, sorry if you love it) Quentin Tarantino has resurrected something else. He resurrected John Travolta, now he has resurrected the 70s kung fu type of movies.The action sequences in this film are really fun, but some of the sword fighting can be a bit stupid, you see arms and heads chopped off and showers of blood fires out from them. The sword battles are enjoyable to watch though.I think this has quite a good cast, we have Quentin's favourite leading ladie Uma Thurman. We have Lucy Lui, who is an interesting character, and the film tells you about her childhood history. Sonny Chiba, Quentin's favourite martial artist has a short appearence, and we hear the voice of David Carradine, who plays Bill.The film acts the same as &quot;Pulp fiction&quot; a bit, when it gets to a new bit it tells you the chapter on the screen, there is tons of fun dialogue, a lot in chinese too. Quentin also tries to make this film look like the 70s, he uses the classic music and films the scenes like them. He puts some scenes in b&amp;w aswell. He uses a lot of interesting characters like The bride, Bill, woman with eye-patch, and the Texas sheriff, who was quite cool. This one isn't as violent as everyone says it is, it's gory, but not violent, and it comes to a brilliant climax that all of you should have seen on a trailer or something. Be warned: If you don't like annimation scenes, you might wanna watch out, there is a scene whioch tells you about the history of Lucy Lui's character, and it's an annimation sequence. Quentin has made a brillaint comeback after the failure of Jackie Brown.	5.0	Violent, cool, sick, stupid, fun.	2004-06-03	4	3	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A12B79BWZ1XDUG	Q	Kill Bill is quite possibly one of the most hilarious movies I have ever seen. While some might say the movie is gratuitous and overly gory, Quintin is satirically poking fun at those very people every time so much as a finger gets chopped off. The excess of blood (often more than humanly possible) is very much intended, as a subtle mockery of the excess of violence in our culture. Quintin is communicating with us in the simplest of form. It isnt the limb getting chopped off that is funny, but the sheer absurdity of the situation; Kill Bill hardly ever takes itself seriously. While the humor is quite subtle, it is very much present, and a large part of what makes this movie great. Tarintino's humor persists even in the &quot;making of Kill Bill&quot; featurette in which he goes on about how difficult descisions like picking his actors, soundtrack, and even the movie concept itself were actually just made in split seconds. He goes so far as to say he picked an actor simply because he saw her on a box of a video at his local rental store!Quintin Tarintino is a genius, and this movie his brain child.	5.0	Tarintino is a genius	2004-04-17	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1I1793NRQ030X	Quick write	Amidst the mindless violence that is captured in this film there is a subtle and elegant beauty between the storyline and the way Tarantino portrays it. Tarantino's style of filming is pushed into full throttle when it comes to kill bill; the sound track is great and merged perfectly from scene to scene. Tarantino did a great job of merging animation into the film and also the cut scenes where it goes black and white. Overall I would say this is a solid film, definitly noteworthy for the way it brings Kung fu movies to the 21st century	4.0	Tarantino's style	2013-01-15	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3CI4SA5MCHOR	"raboof ""Lauren in Tokyo"""	"Tarantino disappoints with this film.Here's the plot.  Uma Thurman is beaten nearly to death by a handful of associates.  Upon waking up from a coma 4 years later, she sets out to extract revenge from those people.The rest of the movie consists of Tarantino using excessive violence to cover up the gaping lack of substantive plot.  ""Excessive violence"" is probably too weak a term to describe the action in this movie.  Any body part you'd care to name probably has a scene dedicated to its forceful removal at the hands of Uma Thurman or Lucy Liu or her henchmen.The problem with the movie isn't the violence, though.  The violence is only symptomatic of the bigger problem which is that Tarantino is clearly out of ideas.  The story only progresses because Thurman keeps defeating her enemies as if this were nothing more than a real-life video game.In a stylistic sense, Tarantino is great.  His use of sound, colors, and lighting play a large part in fooling the audience into enjoying this movie.  He is a master director, but his writing star is setting.  It must be hard to hit a home run again after smash hits like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but he doesn't even make it to first base on this outing.Buy the film if you are a die-hard Tarantino fan.  If you aren't a fan, I can't recommend renting it.  This film offers nothing but pornographic violence on a pretty set.  Tarantino has done much better in the past.  This film is a disapointing wreck.  2 stars."	2.0	Big hat, no land	2004-08-22	8	4	4

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AF6OD1O5YCU1P	Rae	It doesn't take long for the viewer to begin feeling sympathy for The Bride.  You know she was no saint before all this happened, but you overlook it.  You see her as she is in the present; you feel sorry for her and you cheer her on.  That's the mark of good writing.The violence.  Well, this *is* a Tarantino flick.  Reservoir Dogs was a bloodbath.  Maybe that should be a primer before seeing Kill Bill Vol 1.  That said, the spurting blood was just hokey.  Too many times the story is detracted from because you're wondering what the special effects person and Tarantino were thinking when they did 'that.'There is also one scene where the violence just drags on.  Okay, we get it.  One person slays many - does it matter if many is dozens or scores?  That scene gets old fast.Overall, this is an amazing movie.  The violence may not be entirely essential to the plot, but it is complementary.  The plot is remarkable.  The storytelling is engaging.  This movie is worth a view.

To me, a good movie has to be either deep, touching, or pure fun. This movie is simply pure fun to watch. Uma is certainly the best actress for this role. I can't think of any other Hollywood actress that would be half as good as her. She is absolutely marvelous. The way she handles the sword is so cool, and professional as well. My favorite scene is the combat between Uma and Lucy in the courtyard. The Japanese winter view, the landscape, and the beautiful snowfall already grabbed my attention, let along the stunning music. The fighting took place under such peaceful surroundings. Everything was fascinating.Again, this movie may not make you think, but it's a gorgeous movie to watch.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1J75JJ0Q2OEJN	Raven A. Wind	Strike what I said in the title. This IS the best Quentin Tarentino film. This is the film he left his Blockbuster Video career behind to make. This is better than Pulp Fiction, by far. Every character is engaging, and the story is layered well, and laid out in the best possible way.My only complaint with this Blu-ray Disc release is that they didn't take the opportunity to give us Region 1 folks the uncensored version of the Bride's fight with the Crazy 88s. In the Japanese version, this scene is in color. In America, they made it black & white to cut down the gore level to R-rating standards. You'd think that Blu-ray would be the ultimate version, especially this long after the movie's initial release, but NOPE. It's the same version you'll get on DVD; Just better looking.It's still amazing, though. Get both volumes and make an evening of it.	5.0	One of the Best QT films.	2008-10-23	6	3	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2LNP6JE11OHZR	Razor Queen(Witch Hunter)	I've got to hand it to Tarantino. He blatantly rips off every anime/martial art flick imaginable and gets praised for it. I'm not saying the movie is a waste of time. Its just frustrating to know that there are anime and martial art films that are a hundred time better then this, and worth watching. Go Go was a direct rip off from Sukenban Deka, no scratch that, every shoujo anime in existence. As were all the sword fights. I am just surprised that snow fell at the end instead of cherry blossom petals. But I guess it would have been one of the two. Even the way the blood spurts is copied. Okay he could have improved it, and made it his own but nooooo, homage my ass! This movie is just about Tarantino having some fun, throwing bits of everything he likes into the mix, not caring about the end result. I mean, at least give us a reason to care about these people. If your going to do an anime sequence, make it good, memorable, not that crap, it was very sloppy. And one more thing, does Uma Thurman have the most ugliest pair of feet in existence or what! I mean Jesus, that is what you have body doubles for. And he had to zoom in on them for like 15 seconds. On the big cinema screen it's enough to put you off your popcorn, and that's with make up and probably a full pedicure as well. And Lucy Lou is completely boss eyed, is she too vain to wear glasses or something? Thank god I'm incredibly bloodthirsty. It's the only thing that kept me watching this film. There are a couple of people I would like to get revenge on as well, its fun to imagine slicing them apart with a Hanzo sword of my own.	3.0	Gets you in the mood for a night of bloodsucking	2004-08-09	7	2	5

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A39W3263A9HCMN	"Renfield ""Up the Irons"""	KB1 and 2 are PERFECT. But this review is for Kill Bill 1.Plot: The Bridr is a woman who is getting married. On her wedding day, she gets a bullet put in her head by a partner in her assassin squad named Bill. She goes into a 4 year coma and when she wakes up, she is not ready to make nice. She has a hit list, which consists of the DVAS (Deadly Viper Assassination squad). She goes to Japan, gets Hattori Hanzo sword, and is ready to begin the slicing and dicing.This is an AWESOME movie. Great Cast (Sonny Chiba? AWESOME!!!!), and great music. Uma Thurman is brilliant in her role as The Bride. She can play The Bride like nobody else can. I was also surprised to see Chiaki Kuriyama as GoGo, the sexy, schoolgirl-dressed Crazy 88 who is also strong in her performance.And not to mention the blood and gore. Over the top, yet in a good way. Whenever a limb gets amputated, blood sprays out in an over the top fashion. Love it! And this is a great film overall, so see it!	5.0	You lose.	2008-10-06	4	0	4
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2Y8IJ7XQXM4D3	Rev. C. Bryant	I went to see Kill Bill in the middle of a mostly mind-numbing convention.  The movie did nothing to improve my mood.  The level of violence--implied, threatened, and realized--overwhelms what could have been an interesting storyline.  This is commercial exploitation at its schlockiest--before one can understand Kill Bill 1, one needs to see Kill Bill 2, where supposedly all questions will be answered (Who is the Bride?  How did she become an assassin?  Why did someone want to kill her?  Why did they pick her wedding in the middle of Nowhere, Texas?  Who is Bill, anyway?).  I come out of few movies wishing I hadn't wasted my time, but this is one of them.  Skip the DVD and find something good, like Master and Commander.	1.0	Mind-Numbing Garbage	2004-05-23	18	6	12
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2ADZB98LKC0X4	"Revolverchaos ""Revolverchaos"""	&quot;Revenge is a dish best served cold.&quot;Quentin Tarantino's fourth film and the first one since 1997's Jackie Brown takes the theme of revenge like Hamlet on steroids. It has not been an easy road for this generation's &quot;It&quot; director. Tarantino once worked at a video rental store before writing the script for Reservoir Dogs that he later directed. It was his directorial effort in 1994's Pulp Fiction that catapulted Tarantino, as well as the independent film company Miramax, into the Hollywood mainstream. Unfortunately his next film, Jackie Brown, which, by the way, was not written by him, was not widely accepted and then Quentin Tarantino dropped off the scene for nearly six years. In that time period he took time off to act in some films but, for the most part, the idea for Kill Bill had been bouncing around in his skull. Now that idea has burst out of that skull in all its blood spewing, gut splattering glory reuniting Pulp Fiction star, Uma Thurman, with the acclaimed cult director in a film series that pays homage to the 70's karate films that many us grew up with.The story centers on a former member of a group of assassins who seeks revenge for the actions done on to her by her former colleagues. A woman known only as The Bride has waken up from a four year comma after her former boss Bill left her for dead on the day of her wedding killing her fianc&eacute;, the wedding party and her unborn child. Unfortunately for the skilled assassin, he made one big mistake: he failed to kill her. Now that she has awakened from her living slumber, The Bride will travel the world picking off her attempted killers one by one including the mysterious Bill. First up on her list is O-Ren Ishi, aka Cottonmouth, and her group of Japanese underground assassins. They better watch out because here comes the bride! The story for Kill Bill (Volume I) is probably one of the best scripts of the year despite being only half of the true plot. In a wonderful bit of technique, Tarantino starts the film off in the middle of story then backtracks to the events that start the chain reaction of revenge. He then flashes backwards and forwards in several instances that offer the best insight into the characters the audience is about to encounter. This gives better meaning to most of the fight sequences that take place in the course of the two hour feature.A relative bunch of low-profile actors and actresses make up one of the better casts of the year for this film. Uma Thurman, who starred in Quentin Tarantino's breakout film, Pulp Fiction, once again works her magic for the talented director in probably her best film performance. Thurman gives a witty and exhilarating go around with her role as The Bride seeking revenge against her former colleagues. She presents a style to the character that makes you clamor for her all the way to the shocking break point. Lucy Liu has another kick-ass character performance as O-Ren Ishi, the leader of a group of Japanese assassins. The only problem with this role is that it makes Liu feel type-casted into this sort of character. Not that she bad at it, she's extremely effective in her performance, but you get the feeling that eventually she may get bored with these roles but if it works for her then ignore this comment. Vivica A. Fox doesn't really get to show much acting ability as her character is killed off in the first fifteen minutes of the film but what she does show is her amazing fighting moves, which is the only evidence needed to prove her worth in the film. This is only a small portion of the full cast, the rest of which will appear in Kill Bill (Volume II) coming February 20th.Overall, Kill Bill (Volume I) is a wonderful kick-off point for Quentin Tarantino's best work since Pulp Fiction, despite only being half of the entire feature. Though that being said, there are a couple of things to pick at including the well-choreographed action sequences. It wasn't exactly the sequences themselves but the rather large amount of blood and gut spilling that occurred during them that had more then one person squirming in their seats. Granted having your arm or leg cut off results in a large amount of blood loss but does that blood spew out like a fountain? The campy style of violence that occurs in Kill Bill (Volume I) may seem disturbing as the feature starts off but by the end, it doesn't seem so unnatural, which says something our culture's customization to violence and bloodshed in films. The pacing of the feature seemed well balanced but definitely dragged near the end as the film wrapped in a spin-chilling conclusion for the time being. But other then those small squabbles, Quentin Tarantino gives an eerie insight into what the concept of revenge does to the human psyche and what it could potential lead people to do if not controlled. It is said in the film, revenge is like a forest. Men (and women) can easily be lost in it and lose track of where they started or where they were going, so caution must be taken when start off on this path. The famous cult director starts off with accelerating beginning; let's hope he can deliver on what the chilling twist promises.	5.0	Just brilliant	2004-08-03	5	5	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1P179RQO8I518	"R. Flynt ""Diga2000"""	"There are not many things to be said about this film, but it is simply remarkable.  It would amount to a failure of conscience if I neglected to comment.Kill Bill Volume One is simply the finest incarnation of what makes Quentin Tarantino one of the most exceptional artists of our time.  I have viewed many of the films in which Mr. Tarantino has had a hand (True Romance, Reservoir Dogs, Natural Born Killers, Iron Monkey, Pulp Fiction), and they were all more than commonly entertaining.  This film however, has brought the Tarantino experience into brilliant focus.  I have found all of his efforts to be effective insightful studies on the most human of experiences...violence.  And while some find it excessive in some cases, maybe all, the discovery of the characters and their motivations are the most entertaining part of the ride that is a Tarantino film.  Once again, the well-written script, impeccable casting, acting, and direction have combined to weave that old black magic that he does so well.  Here in Volume One, there is a direct connection to the experience that produces the rage, vengeance, and finally unbridled violence that appear on the screen.  I would say that while there are many acts of violence in the film, none of them feel excessive.  Quite to the contrary, on second and third thought, they scarcely seem enough to repay the outrageous violations suffered by the main character (immaculately portrayed by Uma Thurman).  As I watched this film, every aspect of its' execution served to increase a wanton desire for blood, and though much was shed, the hunger remained for more.  At the end of the film, I was disappointed as well as relieved that ""the list"" still had names left to cross out.  It was a valiant and terrible effort but Bill still lives, and the betrayers continue to take breath.  They must be made to pay for expectation of death and the error of their execution.  Any viewer of this film is sure to know why Bill must be killed."	5.0	Pure...	2003-12-28	2	2	0

As much as his films may be an &quot;homage&quot; to other films, he can take this and run with it, creating the most wonderful and original scenarios.

Tributes to Sergio Leone, Brian de Palma, Anime and Kung-Fu films are obvious. Casting David Carradine was truly inspired. Also his use of color and editing are brilliant.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2H9UO8RYFX5MB	"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich"""	"The opening shot of ""Kill Bill"" is one of the most memorable I can recall: in stark black and white, a woman's face -- almost unrecognizable as Uma Thurman's at first -- spattered with blood, coated in sweat, a bridal veil spread out beneath her. She gasps, clearly in pain, as a hand reaches in to wipe some of the blood and sweat from her face with a handkerchief. The handkerchief bears the name ""Bill"" on it. A voice (Bill's, we presume) speaks to her. The Bride's first words, just preceding the gunshot which spatters more blood from her head onto the veil, are so surprising that I had to rewind the scene and watch it again just to be sure I heard them correctly.Starting from this provocative point, Tarantino weaves quite a story in ""Kill Bill,"" adopting his usual technique of starting somewhere in the middle, then jumping the audience forward and back in time to fill in the gaps. It took two films, clocking in at just over 4 hours total, to tell this story. It is both intricate and intriguing, and it stands out as a high-water mark in some ways for Tarantino, while maintaining much of what his diehard fans seem to love him for.I'm writing about both parts of ""Kill Bill"" mainly as a single film because that's the way I first watched them (one right after the other), and also because that is what Tarantino originally intended for them. Apart from a slightly cheesy ""synopsis"" segment at the beginning of Volume 2, they fit together almost seamlessly. It is my feeling that they are best watched in a single sitting, if at all possible.In terms of story, ""Kill Bill"" is Tarantino's best work since ""Reservoir Dogs"" (still my personal favorite in his brief but notable body of work). Tarantino keeps it moving at a brisk pace, rarely letting exposition slow down the action, but there is a lot of story here to tell. Each character gets their story told in turn, and the audience can quickly see how each individual character's story ties into the Bride's story, which is the main thrust of the film. Her tale of revenge against those who tried to kill her (and, obviously, failed) leads down a twisting path, drawing the audience deeper and deeper into the lives and motivations of everyone. The main theme of the film seemed to be summed up in the observation that the road to revenge leads through a thick forest, and it is often very easy to get distracted from the path.In Volume 1, the action sequences mostly overshadow the characters themselves, and the fight scenes are pretty memorable. Definitely not for the faint of heart, the fights are nevertheless somewhat cartoonish in their depiction of violence. They are mostly reminiscent of Japanese anime: literal geysers of blood, dozens of amputated limbs, improbable (but beautiful) sword work, moves that even the pros would envy deeply, and a great deal of variety in how people are hurt or killed all add up to some pretty solid action in Volume 1 of ""Kill Bill."" This is almost assuredly not going to be for everyone, but fans of Tarantino's genre-bending ultra-violent style will surely be satisfied.What surprised me was that Tarantino was more emotionally honest in this film (particularly in Volume 1) than I've ever seen. Uma Thurman puts in a fine performance from the first frame to the last, and really balances the ferocity of her character with her more vulnerable moments. We get the impression that every emotion the Bride feels is felt deeply, whether grief or joy or rage. Part of this is due to Tarantino's grasp of good dialogue, and part due to a nicely turned performance from Thurman.Quentin Tarantino seems to enjoy making genre movies but twisting the meaning of the genre, and he clearly has enough of an understanding for the genres he works in to manipulate them cleverly. His attention, in ""Kill Bill,"" to the samurai fighter movie is both homage and elevation of the genre. He pays it tribute by mirroring many of its techniques, and he makes it better by adding in some excellent dialogue and a well-crafted story.Tarantino fans should be (and, if you read other reviews, clearly are) well-pleased by what they find in ""Kill Bill."" His ear for dialogue, his skill with a complex story, and his somewhat extreme sensibilities are all in strong evidence here. What I think is really good about ""Kill Bill"" is that even those who haven't liked Tarantino in the past may find something of value in this movie. If you can get past the occasional (OK, frequent) fountain of blood jetting from a combatant's severed limb and let yourself get into the story, you're in for a pretty fun ride.Two other quick comments before closing. Tarantino often inserts himself as an actor in his own movies. He's usually not bad, but I was glad to see that he wasn't in this one. It was the better for his staying behind the camera. And leading off the film by quoting the old Klingon proverb, ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"" -- that was simply priceless. Say what you will about Tarantino, but he does know his audience well."	4.0	The Blood-Spattered Bride	2004-09-03	4	2	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AYZG6B6IZFDXW	Rick Broida	I find it sad that this movie has received such accolades when it's nothing more than one gratuitiously violent scene after another. For example (spoiler alert), early on in the movie, Uma Thurman kills the mother of a four-year-old girl -- right in front of her. (And since when do four-year-olds ride the schoolbus? Get a clue, Quentin.) Later, during the anime sequence, a young girl hides under the bed while her mother and father are brutally, graphically slaughtered. Ha, ha... am I supposed to laugh now?

Fox,Daryl Hannah,and Luck Liu. Not to mention a cameo appearance of Sonny Chiba-what's better than that?!The cartoonish kitsch factor is what makes the movie quite so addictive-blood,lots of FAKE blood from one human body that even a real human body can't contain.The dialog,for example-The Bride(Thurman) and GoGo Yubari(Chiaki Kuriyama)and use of Japanese language.Music was played part of it.The pan-flute that Tarantino said he heard in a Thai restaurant found perfect for the key scenes when The Bride recieved her steel from Hattori Hanzo(Chiba).Even the the way the Chinese/Japanese actors played as the Crazy 88's carried themselves in the House of Blue Leaves where Oren Ishii(Liu)makes a grand entrance,Buck the male r.n.,and the Japanese Charlie Brown who works at the House of Blue Leaves where the showdown between The Bride and Oren takes place.A movie quite humorously funny and just makes you want to observe every scene.	5.0	Thurman slices it up in Tarantino's 4th film!	2005-04-03	1	1	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AZK1N0JHWMQVE	R. J. Woerheide	Kill Bill stands as one of the most effectively ambitious examples of creative filmmaking this side of the 20th century. Tarantino's quirky genius--more comfortable in its own skin and increasingly matured--takes viewers on a daunting, dizzying, and deadly journey. The unapologetic revenge flick is the (...) prot&eacute;g&eacute; of dozens of martial arts movies, spaghetti westerns, and cult films, spanning the twentieth century. Their influence can be felt from the opening credits to the final scenes, and is woven throughout the storyline. So much of what makes this a good movie has to do with the artistic touches Tarantino brings to the screen: utilizing the Japanese style of animation, or exploiting monochromatic filtering, are just two simple examples. Both films boast a rich production design which often explodes with visual interest. The editing, sound design, and directing all compliment a cast of devoted actors-most of whom spent months training full time for the demanding physical aspects of their roles. The film is certainly bloody at times, particularly in Volume 1, but the violence serves an important role in amplifying the mythology of Kill Bill. Audiences will be missing out if they can't see past that violence; the films' many merits certainly outweigh the not-so-occassional fountain sprays of blood. Not for the faint of heart, Kill Bill is an absolute must for those who consider themselves movie buffs, and it gets five stars here simply because of its unadulterated genius.	5.0	Unadulterated genius!	2004-08-24	5	2	3
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3GB6RKLASF9HB	"R. Kearns-White ""rockiw"""	"Kill Bill, Vol. 1, at its heart, is really a simple tale of a wanna-be murder gone wrong and the revenge that courses through the intended victim. However, in Quentin Tarantino's hands, Kill Bill is an overblown blood fest.Uma Thurman plays ""The Bride,"" who is also known as ""Black Mambo."" She was a part of an elite killing squad with 4 other adept assassins played by Vivica A. Fox, Darryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, and Lucy Liu. These five killers are headed up by Bill, whose face we never see in the movie. For some unexplained reason, Bill and his four killers set out to murder a very pregnant Black Mambo on her wedding day. They torture and kill Black Mambo and her unborn child...so they think. Black Mambo/The Bride awakens from a four year coma with revenge killing on her mind.The movie switches back from the distant past, to the recent past, and to the present at lightening speed without making much of a cohesive plot. The flick is filled with Quentin Tarantino -esque pop culture references and psuedo-philosophical speeches from his characters. The only thing lacking in the dialogue is his normal excessive usage of the word n***ger.Kill Bill, Vol. 1, is an ostentatious homage to the 1950s Japanese samurai, the 1970s kung fu, and the late 80s/early 90s Hong Kong action movies. I even suspect that Lucy Liu's character's name, O-Ren Ishii is a homage to the rap group N.W.A. (O standing for the first letter in Ice Cube's real name, Oshay. Ren for the deejay of N.W.A., and ""ishi"" sounds a lot like ""Eazy-E."") I give the movie three stars out of five for the plot twist at the end, the excellent swordplay, and the Wu-Tang Clan's RZA's spot-on original scores."	3.0	ostentatious homage to the 1970s kung fu movies	2004-05-30	9	2	7

It's essentially a third-rate, high-violence, somewhat twisted Charlie's Angels. Two main problems. Unlike the Angels, Uma Thurman is not, in the least respect, attractive. The second problem--she can't act. She's simply a terrible actress. Can movies still be good even with bad acting? Sure. Unfortunately, Kill Bill still sucks for a number of reasons. I know it's an action movie, but even as far as action flicks go, this movie has a crap storyline. I know the special effects are ""supposed to"" suck, but that idea in itself kind of...well, sucks. Overall, have I seen worse films? Yes. But only two. Bottom line: If you appreciate skilled acting and cinematography, avoid Kill Bill, Vol. 1 at all costs.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	"Kill Bill, vol. I (Quentin Tarantino, 2003)Quentin Tarantino's long-awaited fourth film finally ended up released in two parts. I'm not sure why; the four-hour debacle Dances with Wolves got a theatrical release, and was a smash hit, tying up screens that could have been put to better use showing static for months. So someone finally comes along with a good four-hour film, and the Weinstein brothers decide it needs to be cut into two films. Silly of them.In the first part, we meet The Bride (Uma Thurman, who previously worked with Tarantino in Pulp Fiction) and the five people on her hit list (though we meet two of them more fully than the other three). The first film concentrates on giving us part of the backstory and showing The Bride's assassination attempts on the first two names, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu of Ally McBeal fame) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox, recently of the Lifetime TV series 1-800-Missing). As usual, the thought goes through the viewer's head: ""Where on earth does Tarantino come up with these names?"" We may never know.As I write this, the film sits at #58 on IMDB's top 250. As is usual with movies in the top 250, I don't think it deserves a spot there, but it's certainly a nice piece of work. It's both homage and parody at different times, and Tarantino is a talented enough director that we know which parts are which, and any blurring between the two is intentional. The pacing is immaculate (another reason this could well have worked as a single four-hour piece), and the story is given to the viewer just quickly enough to keep the curiosity alive. Very good stuff, well worth watching. *** "	4.0	Good beginning.	2005-02-15	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ	Robert Blake	&quot;Kill Bill&quot; is Quentin Tarantino once again tearing into a genre and producing something uniquely his and yet obviously made by a fan. This is an exciting, stylish and over-all original and fresh movie, the type of filmmaking we long for in an era of boring trends (teen movies) and repetitive action movies. Tarantino here combines his trademark skill in crafting witty, memorable dialogue with his surprisingly amazing eye for incredible action sequences. &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is not as complex or brainy as Tarantino's previous &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Jackie Brown,&quot; but it is a superb take on the martial arts genre filtered through the Tarantino membrane. It feels like an exploitation movie elevated to a higher art form because we still get Tarantino's genius for writing and storytelling. The cinematography by Robert Richardson (of Oliver Stone and Martin Scorsese fame) is rich and he beautifully lights every scene. The performances are also very skillfull for what essentially is a Kung-Fu flick. Uma Thurman is bold as The Bride, she lets us feel the strain both physically and mentally of her character. The entire film plays almost like classic drama, it is an exciting movie to watch and seeing it once is not enough. First it should be seen for the visceral experience, second for the dialogue, the performances and perfect timing of each scene. It's also fun to catch where Tarantino borrows from other movies to paste into his own. And it's all done with a great sense of style and craft. Watching a Tarantino film can be a special experience for most cinephiles because you get the feeling it's being made by a fan, by a guy who simply loves movies. &quot;Kill Bill Vol. 1&quot; is an exhilarating action piece and awesome filmmaking craft.

The different styles used in the movie were all awesome, from the black & white scenes, shadow fight scene, the anime sequence (wasn't sure how I'd feel about an anime scene in a live-action movie but it was perfect)The fight scenes.. Amazing.. Awesome.. Incredible.. nah, not any of those 3 words can describe it, we need to come up with a new word to describe the fight scenes in this movie. The fight with the Crazy 88's towards the end was the most incredible thing I've ever seen in my life. So much blood, if you're queasy you might not enjoy this but the movie is so good I'd still suggest you see it anyway!The soundtrack was excellent. Quentin really knows how to use music in movies, I love the soundtrack to all his films and as usual every song in this movie fits perfectly with the scene.This is definitely my favorite Tarantino movie, and it's only volume 1!I seriously cannot wait until February for Volume 2!...Oh, and did I mention how awesome the fight scenes are?	5.0	Amazing.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1NBJ1H2DRHGBV	"Robert D. Pollock ""Leadership Student"""	2003 was a pretty darn good year for movies.  We got Return of the King -- if not the greatest movie ever made, it's certainly one of them.  Kill Bill isn't to the scale of a LOTR movie by any means.  These movies are by their very nature more epic, and epic usually means better.  But that's what's so great about Kill Bill.  It's not epic.  It's a pretty simple story.  The sophistication of Kill Bill was not the story itself, but how the story was told.  As a traditional Tarantino, it's nonlinear, and just like Reservoir Dogs, you never actually SEE the scene at the wedding chapel.  That's Tarantino's gift; he tells you EVERYTHING about the pivotal scene of the storyline, down to &quot;Hotaru no Hikari&quot; on Sophie Fatale's ringer (for the outraged Americans, Hotaru no Hikari is the Japanese version of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;), but you don't see the scene.  Perhaps more brilliant is the music of Kill Bill.  It's simply flawless, to the open &quot;Bang, Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)&quot; performed perfectly by Nancy Sinatra, to the whistling Elle Driver tune &quot;Twisted Nerve,&quot; that literally GIVES you a twisted nerve if you listen to it for too long.  That the music flows so perfectly with the scenes and evokes such emotion is what makes Kill Bill one of the best movies of 2003.  It's a must-see for any movie fan, not just fans of Tarantino.	5.0	One of the Best Movies of 2003	2003-12-29	6	5	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1JHJ48J9EZNMH	Robert evans	Kill bill was an awsome flick to watch.It wasnt tarnatinos best but it was an awsome movie towatch.  The cast members were better than perfect with thecasts of uma thurman,david carridine,michal madeson,lucy lui,vivaca A fox and more.  The movie is a simple revenge movie with lota action.  This was probably the most entertaining movie of 03.  The anim was beatifly made done for lucy luis character.The story is simple.  Uma thurma(Bride)is beatin and killed.But some how she survives.  Her boss bill kills her on the day of her wedding and now Bride returns after few months incoma and now looking for reveng.  Now all she wants to do iskill all the members who beat her to death and the man who put a bullet in her head...Bill.  This isnt just another revenge movie.Its tarantino's Revenge Movie!  Tarantino needs no introduction cause he knows what the hell hes doing.The film is filled with action.  I cant really explain any thing or use big words cause IM just not that type of person.Uma thurman did marvales in this movie.  I applaud her for this.She hadnt bin in a movie for a while to.  The only movie she stard in was an HBO original movie Wich she did great in!Im glad how they took parts from the whole movie and seperated them so they make it into 2 part epic adventure.The movie is very entertaining and extreamly violent filled with gore decapitation and lots and lots of blood spraying.  If it wasnt for the black and white this movie would have bin NC-17.For one example an asian girl who works for yakuzas ask this man if she wants to have sex with him.  When the man says she jams a broken glass bottle of wisky into the mans stomach,when she takesit out his intestince and liver start spraying out of his stomach all over the place.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3IBXED14SKZ8Y	"Robert Evans ""Robert"""	"Kill Bill is yet another great film from the creator of Pulp Fiction.  Kill Bill is was one of my favorite films in 2003 and I'm very glad to see a DVD edition out.  It is a great film it has style, it's funky, it's fresh and it just plain rocks.  The film is a simple Revenge movie but it's not what you're expecting, trust me it's from QT man!  I'm not going to get into plot but I will say the cast is amazing with Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Michael Madeson and the list go's on!The Movie has little dialoug unlike the rest of Tarantino's Movies like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown ect.  Also I must say the film seemed abit cheesy if you ask me but that doesn't stop you from enjoying this film.  The film also has a great sets of music and I will be getting the soundtrack soon.Awwwhhh yet again..here go's another one of my opinions on how violent this film is(I seem to critisize films that are overhyped by the violence i.e Dog Soldiers ect)And frankly you people don't know what graphic Violence is if you really thought that this film was ""graphic"".  I read some reviews from a school that lets college students write there review and I must say this is complete Horse crap.  This films violence is not Disturbing nor graphic you people just can't handle violence.  I MEAN WHEN YOU GET YOUR HEAD SLICED OFF YOU DON'T HAVE CLEAR LOOKING BLOOD SQUIRTING OUT OF YOUR NECK LIKE THE WAY SHOWERS DO!  The violence (as some people who know what is violent)is very, very unrealistic.  The film is not graphic nor disturbing but It's violent alright and pretty Bloody.  The Bride Slices and dices her way through the final Battle in this film and it's superb the way they Choreagraphed(sorry if I spelled it wrong).  As I have said before if you people who haven't seen the film and plan on seeing it don't worry this film is not Disturbing or violent at all it's just that ""some"" people can't handle fake cheesy violence.This film is superb, great acting, great action, simple yet great plot but one thing that really ticks my tocker is this film was butcherd because of the MPAA.  The film was ""censored"" so to speak in the U.S because some of the violence was too ""extreame"" for them and the ""audience"".  If it wasn't for dumb idiots in america getting hooked on GTA and doing all that crap we wouldn't have some films butchered, I mean it's not our fault some people in this world are idiotic enough to go out and get a gun and shoot up the mall just cause some video game character did.  The film was censored here and U.S and I hope Tarantino makes a 2 disc Special editon Unrated Directors Cut.  I have the Japanes version of the film mainly cause it has waaaaaaaaay better extras then the U.S version.  If I were to Rated this for the DVD itself I would have givin it 3 stars but I'm doing the film only.  The films only major parts that cut so Tarantino can get his ""R"" rating was to take some kills out of the final battle in the House of Blue Leaves and he had to make it black and white, not to mention he had to take out the part were Bride Cuts Sophies other arm off in the Car...ewww Poor Sophie.  But over all I acctually choose the U.S version over the Japanes version mainly cause of the black and white scenes.  If you didn't know already the House of Blue Leaves battle was in full color in the Japanes version unlike the U.S version which is in B and W, still I choose the B and W over the japanes ones I just hope that Tarantino makes some better extras when he releases a special editon of this film.Over all Though Censored here in the U.S, Kill Bill is a superb movie with excellent fights, pretty good story, Awesome actors and really characters, though the Violence is cheesy and fake the is suppose to be like that and the film doesn't try to be nothing els but a movie.  That's why I get this film a4.5 out of 5 stars...Kill Bill Vol 2 is waaaay better then this one though.."	4.0	Tarantino did it again!	2004-12-21	4	1	3
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2RVC3ARN2Z8MZ	Robert Golf	Imagine the television show batman, with the dynamic duo using swords instead punches. Well that sums up the last third of this movie. Kill Bill is a shallow patchwork quilt of campy gimmicks involving a lot of violence and even more redundant dialogue. Basically quentin takes the foxforce 5 idea thrown out by mia in pulp fiction and makes a whole movie about it, although the names are different and the characters are more sinister.  Uma is somehow supposed to be this Yank who's a superior sword wielder/killer, and manages to hack 88 or so Japanese men into pieces who have swords too, apparently because she has the great Hanzo's sword, specifically tailored for the mission she's trying to accomplish.  In reality of course, Uma wouldn't  manage to kill a single yakuza before getting chopped to pieces, but whatever the writer wants he gets, right?So anyhow, this movie manages to shock and appall with its quentin-esque violence, yet not have any depth whatsoever.  Probably good enough for the Anime nerds, but nothing that will be remembered in a year's time. Incidentally, I thought he did a really poor representation of Japanese culture, despite what Q's fanboys report. One saving grace is that he wasn't in the movie.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AE31M52VLKOG6	Robert G Yokoyama	Kill Bill is Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece.  He  has combined  elements of king fu movies, old Japanese samurai shows, and cowboy westerns to create a great action movie.  Uma Thurman is so great as a former assassin who turns into an angry bride focused on revenge on everyone after her wedding and life are ruined.  This movie is non stop action from beginning to end.  I loved the scene where Uma takes on a roomful of assassins with black masks and swords and kills them all.  Every fight scene is fun to watch.  I loved the fight scene between Uma Thurman and Vivica A Fox.  It was so funny how they stopped fighting and acted like everything was okay when the little girl came through the door.  Lucy Liu gives a wonderful performance as an  tough Asian assassin.  I loved the scene in the movie where she slices off a person's head after he insults her.  The Japanese animation sequence looks so good in this movie.  I loved watching the making of the movie where Quentin Tarantino talks about his sources of inspiration for making Kill Bill.  There is a pretty good performance by a female Japanese rock band called 5, 6, 7, 8 that is included on this DVD that I enjoyed.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"Question:  Can exquisite, riveting style overcome a near complete lack of substance?  Answer:  Very nearly.KILL BILL, VOLUME 1 is a perfect compendium of Quentin Tarantino's impressive gifts and lamentable shortcomings as a filmmaker.  From the opening studio credits to the closing credits, this film is glitteringly stylish, with virtually no uninteresting frames in between.  I was intrigued by the opening logos, but I confess I was utterly hooked from the second Nancy Sinatra starting singing ""Bang, Bang"" as we gaze at the beaten and battered face of The Bride, played by Uma Thurman.  We never learn her name, and the credits list her as ""The Bride"" (the film is based on a graphic novel of the same name), but we learn that her code name from the secret organization of assassins to which she belongs is Black Mamba.  The rest of the film tells in nonchronological fashion the tale of her avenging herself on those who killed her and her wedding party, beginning with her waking up from a long coma, and proceeding to her systematic revenge.Part of the problem I had with the film is that you have to turn off your brain most of the time and merely enjoy it on a purely tactile level, or at most as a series of cross-references to other movies.  Virtually the entire movie was based upon swordplay, but any dweeb with a gun could have handled any of the assassins in the film with ease.  At least in ENTER THE DRAGON, they took the time to invent a pretext for why there were no guns on Han's island.  In BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and ANGEL there is the pretext that guns were ineffective on vampires and demons.  In KILL BILL, The Bride herself is shot, but why the absence of guns?  Clearly, they are missing for purely stylistic reasons.  But even granting the presence of swords and absence of guns, The Bride's taking on a small army of swordsmen stretches credulity.  If you don't turn off your brain, you will find it impossible to enjoy this film.Approximately half of the film deals with her epic attempt at inflicting her revenge upon O-Ren Ishii a.k.a. Cottonmouth, played by Lucy Liu.  It is preceded by a animated segment that tells of the making of O-Ren Ishii.  The long scene is a movie it itself, and is as visually and stylistically as stunning as anything Tarantino has ever done.  Except on the level of logic, everything about this long scene works.  The set of the Japanese restaurant is spectacular, and there is a wealth of great little touches, like the marvelous Japanese all-girl barefoot surf band (played by The 5, 6, 7, 8s).Ultimately, I wondered what the point of it all was.  It truly did end up being all style and no substance.  Can a film be any good if it is nothing but a succession of brilliant images, even if many of the images are in some way referential to other films?  In rewatching all of films (including his screenplays) recently, I came away wondering if Tarantino has any view of life, has done anything thinking about greater issues.  If he has, it isn't reflected in his films.  Based on them, one sees a view of life that moves exclusively from one pop cultural image to another.  The Text ends up being about other Texts, not about anything that transcends them.  Is Tarantino capable of making a film with genuine tragedy?  Could he make a film featuring a believable moral dilemma?  Can moral issues arise in a Tarantino film?  They nearly did in RESERVOIR DOGS, but he hasn't come close since.  My own gut feeling is that Tarantino will always be hampered as a film maker because he lacks a vision about the significance of any realities beyond the language of pop culture.  He may make more films that are exhilarating and funny and exciting to watch, but I am beginning to wonder if he can make a film that makes us think, or makes us question the shape or point of our lives.  These issues do not, of course, arise with the vast bulk of filmmakers.  If it arises with Tarantino, it is because his gifts are so obvious that one wishes he would move beyond a superficial brilliance to a deeper exploration of the human condition.  Is it possible that he will do this in the second half of this film?  Yes, but I will be amazed if he does so.  There will certainly be surprises, but I doubt if they will have moral or metaphysical aspects.Warning:  This is almost certainly the bloodiest movie ever made.  The blood flies, oozes, spurts, flows, and sprays in a variety of ways.  The way that it spurts from severed limbs reminds me at times of the dismembered Black Knight in MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL.  Mercifully, in the long fight between The Bride and a few dozen swordsmen, the bulk of the fight was filmed in black and white.  This mutes the red from the blood that would have otherwise have covered everything."	4.0	Can exquisite style triumph over lack of substance?	2003-11-25	11	5	6

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3H9JSM1SUTE4O	Robin Simmons	"Quentin Tarantino's epic, blood-spewing, over-the-top, fetishistic, vanity production, KILL BILL Volume1 (Miramax) arrives on DVD just in time to wet anew the appetite for the big screen theatrical finale Kill Bill Volume 2.  So much has already been written about this high-profile, visual tour-de-force Asian-cinema martial arts homage and revenge saga (yes, it's all that and more), there's not much left to say.  The story of a massacre by an Asian gang at a wedding rehearsal that leaves pregnant former gang member Uma Thurman for dead is the set up.  The rest is all back story and exposition as a very lithe and determined Uma seeks out all those who block her path to Bill (a barely seen David Carradine), her ex-lover and the gang leader. But the story is really an excuse for dazzling filmmaking and brilliant riffs of heady dialogue.At heart, this is the darkest of comedies, a demented parody of excess.  In the better than average making-of featurette, Tarantino enthusiastically explains the stylistic inspirations (including Sergio Leone) for his film and the origins of the Bride character that he and Uma jointly developed while shooting Pulp Fiction.  Bonus material also includes trailers of Tarantino's three other films and very cool musical performances by ""The 5, 6, 7, 8's"" an amazing group Tarantino heard on a juke box in a Japanese bar while scouting locations. If there's any doubt that this movie is tongue in bloody cheek, check out the action figures, Pussy Waqon key chains, flasks, lighters and lunch box paraphernalia on the DVD insert. If you plan to see Volume 2, don't miss this dizzy exercise by a remarkably gifted, intuitive filmmaker."	3.0	THE ZEN OF KILLING	2004-04-11	2	2	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1ABDWJU9RTUWU	Rockinghorse Winner	I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was well acted and choreographed, had a suspenseful plot and a sympathetic main character. The cinematography was great, especially the final battle scene which took my breath away. However, being a relative newcomer to Tarantino, I expected this film to follow in the tradition of the ones I've seen so far in having great, quirky dialog punctuated periodically by violence. This movie reverses the formula, however, and we have here an almost non-stop carnival of gore which pauses periodically to propel the storyline forward with dialog which, IMHO, is not up to the the standards I'd come to expect from QT.While the director's tongue is still kept snugly in his cheek throughout, and there are a great many paeans to films from the past, I felt the video game violence and comic book stick figures were not able to carry the moral weight of a revenge film like this. While the film was fun to watch, and the simple plot left lots of room for the hilarious diversions Tarantino is known for, I just felt a little less gore and a little more dialog would have created a happier balance.	3.0	Good Film, but What Happened to that Great Tarantino Dialog?	2014-01-13	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"Quentin Tarentino's ""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" is the perfect film for today's ""trendy chic"" movie going audience.  Casual in its violence, flashy in its visuals, and conspicuously lacking in content and theme, the film is a genuine triumph of style over substance and a testament to the art of ""cool.""  Here is a film so self-consciously arch and emotionally detached that it plays more like a live action cartoon than a drama set in anything remotely resembling the real world (in fact, one section of the movie literally is a cartoon).  The ""plot"" is, essentially, one long drawn out revenge scene with Uma Thurmon as a young woman systematically seeking out and killing a band of assassins who left her, her unborn child, and her entire bridal party for dead on the day of her wedding.Yet, what person in his right mind goes to a Tarentino film in search of a meaningful storyline?  Indeed, the thing that counts in a Tarentino work is the director's obvious love for both movies and moviemaking, a love which is visible in every frame he commits to film.  ""Kill Bill"" is Tarentino's affectionate homage to the martial arts epics in which characters defy the laws of physics and gravity as they perform their deadly kabuki-type ballet with knives and swords.  In this pastiche of ninja melodrama and Japanese anime, at least half the film's running time is spent on elaborately staged swordfights and kickboxing sequences, all of which are filmed with the utmost brio and verve.  The violence is, indeed, gory and graphic - with dismemberments galore and fountains of spurting blood - but so preposterously overblown that the violence eventually becomes abstract and thus doesn't offend us much while we're watching it.  Thurmon doesn't have much of a chance to develop a character here, but the steel-eyed intensity combined with the strange sense of vulnerability that she brings to the role makes her fascination to watch nonetheless.Yet, for all its cinematic joie de vivre and visual inventiveness, there's something a bit unsatisfying about ""Kill Bill Volume 1""  after all is said and done.  Perhaps it's the fact that the film feels so much like a clinical exercise in style that it lacks the power to really draw us into its world.  We watch it with an air more of detached bemusement than of emotional involvement.  Perhaps, too, the absence of anything much going on beneath the surface leaves us with little of substance to take home with us once we've left the theater.I suspect that this is the very effect Tarentino is going for here - that if we were made to care deeply about anything that was happening on the screen we would somehow be violating his code of ""coolness,"" that we would be simply reacting to movies with the kind of programmed emotional responses the director is clearly militating against.  The problem is that, while we can appreciate all that on an intellectual level, we are still left feeling relatively empty and unfulfilled by movie`s end.  Perhaps, the completion of the story in Volume 2 will help to rectify that condition."	3.0	cool, stylish, empty	2004-12-05	13	10	3
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3JHEGHF9OR8P6	"Roll Man ""Jim"""	Extreme violence is not something that is usually appealing to me but Tarantino's movies give you enough space between reality and fiction to make it interesting and you don't recognize the gore. The music in this movie is perfect as in all of his movies. He is an extremely creative director and this movie is a classic in my opinion. Volume 2 is as good or maybe even a little better.	5.0	Great movie	2012-04-16	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1X49KNI27PP07	romantic fuel	I liked so much about the movie that it's hard to know where to begin. The movie reminded me of the crime fiction pulp magazines from long ago.  The black- and- white flashbacks to the past and soundtrack were campy enough to add to the almost comic book feel of the movie. The fight scenes were AWESOME and the excessive gore and bloody carnage was so exaggerated that you watched it as a cartoon and none of it was disgusting. I loved that the characters each had the code name of a snake. There was dark humor, betrayal, vindication. There were only two things that I didn't like about the movie, and each was very minor: there was just a bit of vulgarity (for the younger folks and the fainthearted.) And instead of being one superlong movie, it was divided into two separate films. I'm not a fan of cliffhangers so I waited until a few days before the sequel was released to rent Part 1 and watch them back to back- first at home and then at the movie theater. Oh, and I was never a big fan of Uma Thurman and doubted that she had the skills to do the main character justice but she was an amazing kick- ass killer!	5.0	Great movie and fighting	2014-03-05	0	0	0

That's not all, though-Uma Thurman pretty much singlehandledly kills upwards of 150 people with a katana. Certain people right now are clicking the ""Add To Cart"" button just for that alone. This is savagery and camp gore elevated to high art. Those of you who didn't tolerate this deathfest too well, I have no idea why you wanted to watch a Tarantino film in the first place...Anyway, to return my attention to the um, target audience(the people who can handle a little creative video violence...but man, there is ALOT in this particular film) it's a ballet of death that will easily meet or transcend your expectations if you know what you're looking for from this movie. But really...if you don't like violence in movies for its own sake, don't go near this thing. You will be insulted, revulsed, and wonder what the world is coming to when people are getting off on 2 hours of nonstop decapitations, stabbings and lopping of limbs.

Soon I brought the QT collection and not I have seen the movie two more times, and I will soon watch it again. Then you might wonder what's so special about it, perhaps even after you've seen it? Well for me it's the special feeling of Hong Kong nostalgia mixed with perhaps the best soundtrack. I've ever heard (the ending sequence with the pan flute music beats everything up to date), hell I even bought the soundtracks of both movies, and I have never bought a soundtrack before. Be careful though if you don't like blood very much because there is a LOT.

He doesn't pay tribute to anything, he basically RIPS OFF scenes, music, and camera shots from a score of classic movies in the above mentioned genre's.It's not new, it's not refreshing and it's not original, it's simply a hack slapping together a meddley of borrowed scenes, wrapped around his own silly story.

I am changed forever after watching the movie.To tell you the truth, I hate violence. I close my eyes through most action movies. But Kill Bill was different. Very different. Besides being very entertaining and very well made, there was much more. As Quentin said in one of his interviews, there is a story behind every character. He may choose not to tell it in the movie but it are there in his mind. The characters in Kill bill exist in Quentin's world.I walked out of the theatre energized and feeling empowered. Buried in tons of fake blood and limbs, there was a message. I don't know if anyone got the same one but mine was that women can be powerful if only we stopped giving ourselves excuses. If Quentin can imagine such a world, why can't we?It's funny that it look that many bodycounts to convince me.	4.0	I don't like action films - but not this one	2004-04-15	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A29CWGLEAS9AUN	"R. Seehausen ""aeroblaster2"""	"As many know, Quentin Tarantino's lovingly crafted ""Kill Bill"" was originally filmed as a single movie.  This review deals with its first half, volume one of two.The movie starts off with a blast...  a gunshot to Uma Thuman's head, to be precise.  Tarantino doesn't waste any time in showing you that this movie is going to be grossly gory, but fortunately, this first shot is the most realistic depiction of violence and gore within the entirety of this first volume.As the credits roll, we're treated to Tarantino's as-always stellar ability to match music with a film--""Bang bang, my baby shot me down"" plays over the opening credits.  This excellent taste in music pervades the entire film, and every selection works alongside the visuals on the screen to give a very specific impression.For, evident as always, Tarantino knows exactly what he's doing when crafting visual and aural sensations within his films.  He's masterful director when it comes to this, and ""Kill Bill"" shows this off remarkably, its looser reality, roving story, and larger budget giving Tarantino the freedom to really wow us with some great visuals.Many have stated that this movie is an elaborate homage to Tarantino's old grindhouse loves, and this is so.  The very style of the film reeks with it, and this isn't a bad thing--it gives the movie a very fresh atmosphere, apperance, and feel and only serves to enhance the story.Unfortunately, the dialogue in ""Kill Bill"", while competent, doesn't even approach the mastery of Tarantino's previous pictures.  But the movie doesn't rest on this as much as, say, ""Pulp Fiction"" did, so it's not a serious flaw in this case.The film climaxes with a huge fight scene, so long and over-the-top gory that you're numb by its conclusion.  Nevertheless, Tarantino did an excellent job of directing the action.""Kill Bill"" is a thrill ride from start to finish, and while it shows the same artistic love of filth that Tarantino has always wallowed in, it's well worth the time of a less than squeamish viewer.  Action fans, those who love the films Tarantino did, or those who simply love *his* films would all get loads of enjoyment from this picture.The DVD itself is sparse, though its featurette on the making of the movie is interesting and entertaining.

The anime sequence that tells the origin of Oren-Ishi even with the blurry effects common in anime looks simply breathtaking.All extras are presented in standard definition and they are basically the same from the DVD version (which explains the missing star on my review):* The Making of Kill Bill vol. 1* '5,6,7,8's' musical performances* Tarantino trailers (from 'Reservoir Dogs' to 'Kill Bill Vol. 2')No official announcements have been made on the 'Whole Bloody Affair', which is supposed to be the definitive version of Kill Bill by Quentin Tarantino. The fact that these two volumes in Bluray dropped in price and Tarantino is already talking about completing the anime section of the volume 1 may indicate these are coming soon.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AIVW1JAT9T44	"Rustin Parr ""Rustin Parr"""	"Oh, the joy of being a movie geek. This year has been a tremendous blessing for all of the human race, or just us film fanatics, as the movie gods have listened to all our prayers to deliver cinematic goodness.  One of these that came as a major grace is called ""Kill Bill: Volume One"", the latest offering from the dark, perverted but brilliant mind of Quentin Tarantino. Last seen under the spotlight in 1997 with ""Jackie Brown"", we have been painfully awaiting his next move throughout a six-year-span. Well, time finally came upon us and the wait is definitely worth it.Appropriately entitled ""Kill Bill"", Tarantino tells a simple revenge story, albeit through his usual non-linear storytelling structure, about a lanky blonde woman (played by the invigorating Uma Thurman) only known as ""The Bride"" a.k.a. ""Black Mamba"" who wakes up from a coma to exact revenge on her former assassin group called ""The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad"" lead by Bill (David Carradine), who aren't really happy of her decision to quit and marry someone in El Paso, Texas. Hence, bloody carnage ensues as Bill and the gang made of eclectic members-Budd, Vernita Green, Elle Driver and Oren-Ishii-massacres The Bride's family and guests on her wedding day, including her unborn baby. Bill saves her for last and shoots her head (on what could be one of the most startling introductions in a movie). Thinking that she's dead, they leave her cold in her blood-splattered wedding dress, which is a terrible mistake on their part, as The Bride gets up from her hospital bed after four years with furious determination and will to destroy every single one of the perpetrators, saving the best for last, which is, of course, Bill, proving that as far as justice goes, it can easily get very poetic.However, this is only half of the story, as Miramix, the film distributor, and Tarantino himself decided to cut the three-hour long movie in half and released them four months apart. That being said, I am very sure that Volume Two will be as equally brutal and vigorously entertaining to what I've seen four times in the theaters (Yes, four times! It's that good!)""Kill Bill: Volume One"" is perhaps the most violent American movie ever (and I've seen a lot of movies). It can be easily be used as an example of how the morals of the Western world have dramatically fallen in the 21st century. But it's most important to know that this movie was made as an ode to those rare, odd, cheesy and absurd kung-fu, Western, exploitation, slasher and grindhouse movies we usually see gathering dust in the cult section of a video store or occasionally seen playing on television at 3 in the morning. Kill Bill: Volume One on the surface looks like a very empty fluff made to only shock the already seemingly desensitized viewers, but underneath, it is really a very intelligent piece of art. Intelligent in a sense that it knows the rules of the cinema: it knows it audiences are and doesn't give a damn thing or two to those who don't want to get involved. For instance, The Bride wears a yellow jumpsuit during the last hour of the movie. To the uninitiated, it's just a striking sexy vintage number. To those in the know, it's a replica of Bruce Lee's tracking jumpsuit from his 1979 movie Game of Death. And this is just only a fraction of Tarantino's endless references, in-jokes and homages to old and obscure cinema. From Brian DePalma to Godzilla, from giallo films to Japanese animations, God knows what else are there he injected. I say this movie is an entire pop culture of pop culture.Even without this quality, it's still deliciously entertaining, boldly creative and visually arresting, it's safe to say that this is an instant classic. No, this is not an Oscar-winning movie, let alone be nominated. But not everything has to have a deep storyline with complex characters to be a great film. This movie has no substance and as empty as a dead shell. But it's an amazingly great film, nonetheless. The fact of the matter is that Tarantino made this with great respect, love and passion of the medium, that he practically utilizes everything to its full advantage from complicated camera shots (the long tracking shot of The Bride going to the washroom is incredible), beautiful cinematography (the claustrophobic and filthy Hospital environment, the beautifully exotic and bright Japanese backdrop), the amazing eclectic selections of music (from Nancy Sinatra's ""Bang, Bang"" to ""The Green Hornet"" theme song) and the excellently choreographed fight scenes as if we're watching an amazing, exhausting ballet dance with swords. Oh yeah, and the beautiful gushing of the blood and gore like water coming down from Niagara Falls.""Kill Bill: Volume One"" is an extravagant, highly-stylized, ultra-energized, uber-violent piece of celluloid. It's made up of a world were grativity is without law, violence is sheer poetry, pissed-off Caucasian women likes to play with samura swords, and even assassins have feelings. It's a world where obscure 1970's disco music goes perfectly seamless along with the motion of decapitation and maiming.Oh what fun!Aside from that movie that left me with tears featuring hobbits and wizards and that fetus-looking boy-fish who seems to say the word ""Precciooooooussssss...."" a lot, this year belongs to Kill Bill: Volume One (and I cannot wait for Volume 2!)Thank you, Tarantino for your sick and twisted mind."	5.0	Maiming and decapitation are never fun.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3L9FTW01LMYSE	Ryne	This movie is definately one of the most unique and stylish films of the year.  Uma Thurman, and the rest of the cast pack a punch unlike any kung fu film ever made.  The action is non stop with a lot of blood shed and stylized martial arts.  The story itself is interesting even if there were no action.  You develop a hate for the villains of the film before you meet them.  The bad guys by the way are Vivica Fox, Daryll Hannah, and Lucy Liu.  Quintin Tarantino should keep doing films because he gets more innovative and more original with each movi he makes.	4.0	Kill Bill	2004-08-05	3	2	1

He takes you for a ride that you never want to end.  The plot, the action, the effects, the score, everything was wonderful.  The way he directed this movie was unlike anything I had ever seen.  I cannot wait to see the second installment.  Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, Darryl Hannah, and Vivica A. Fox all kicked but.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A32ZATC8MSECNF	"saintsomewhere ""suz"""	"Okay- MY fault for looking for something of the ""Pulp"" or ""Reservoir"" caliber - this was my first and most fatal mistake. I was checking my watch 20 minutes into it, wondering when it was going to get good. After two hours, I was still checking, trying to keep from sighing and groaning with boredom. But few movies are all bad: Kill Bill is campy and cute in places (the Japanese Girl Band alone is nearly worth the price of admission,) and you can't beat Uma, even in a bad flick such as this. But the interminable sword fights quickly became tedious, to say nothing of the endless close ups of Lucy Liu (are she and Quentin an item? One would think so from the movie's obsession with her- her character is over developed, while other memebers are barely more than introduced.) The whole film smacked of a freshman art school film project- and if it were that, I'd say the student had great promise. But from Tarantino? I felt ripped off and disappointed.Of course, everyone else I talked to (including the audience, at the time,) apparently LOVED Kill Bill. So perhaps I am finally really getting old. My advice: see the matinee at the lower ticket price and form your own opinion."	2.0	Kill ME instead.	2003-10-20	14	8	6

In fact the second film Vol.2 has a track from THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY. I noticed the influence of old kung fu and spaghetti western films. This was an example of excellent film making and you can tell that Quentin put his heart in this piece of cinematic greatness.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AQI2CW6UKF1ES	Samario C. Oliver	I wasn't always a big fan of chick flicks, but after viewing this, it just makes movies like Bad Boys, The Matrix(Reloaded and revolutions), and Blade, look like boy scouts.After being kinda dissapointed with Jackie Brown, I was wondering if Tarantino was falling off a little bit.  I saw a trailer for this movie, and all the swordplay I saw on it, was calling to me.  I was hoping this wouldn't turn out like another Jackie Brown.Quentin creates a powerhouse, packed with comedy, action, and blood and gore.(They used over 450 gallons of fake blood to make the movie)  It's not a huge plot, but revenge is all that was needed to be said to put this gory tale in motion.This movie takes kick-@$$, blood, gore, and chick flicks, to a level only explored in this film.  If you love blood and gore, blades, action, and Quentin Tarantino fils, this films calling for you.  If you action, and love plot, look elsewhere.peace	5.0	Slice and dice	2004-09-08	3	0	3

The sound quality is extremely bright and crisp.  Watch the film in SDH (uncompressed sound).  This is a good film for testing the quality of your audio system. The Blu-Ray movies 'The Rock' and 'Drive' (in Blu-Ray) also have spectacular sound tracks.Remember, I'm not reviewing the contents of the movie, only the sound quality.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1FQM487AG5NTI	Sam	I think that this movie was poorly put together. It seems that those who think it is the greatest movie ever are more concerned with praising the director because of his past works. My main problem with this film is the swords. What is the purpose? It is not like she and her family were attacked with swords.. they were gunned down but suddenly she picks up a sword, which she has no skill with by the way. The worst scene in this movie is when the bride fights Yakuza and they all have swords and one fights with a ball and chain. I mean really...don't gangsters carry guns? Its set in the 21st century for crying out loud. The plot is horrible, the time frame is wrong and I could understand if it was a comedy..but anything else no. Show yourself some respect and save your money..rent it at best I gave it 2 stars because of its attempt at something unique and at times it was amusing.Uma Thurman : tricks are for-Lucy Lu : - kidswhat the ????????	2.0	Brain Dead Cinema	2004-05-25	6	1	5

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A32XW50ILWOXNO	Samuel McKewon	"Best described as a martial arts blood opera, ""Kill Bill"" is also a manifestation of director Quentin Tarantino's id - its exuberance, its showmanship and ultimately, yes, its shallowness. So disappointed with his last film, the criminally underrated ""Jackie Brown,"" that he took six years to make another, Tarantino dug far into his ""bag,"" as he likes to call it, plucking out a iconic, boring heroine (Uma Thurman) and trapping her in a bright, messy samurai flick so immense that it had to be split into two volumes.Yet ""Kill Bill"" is a step back for the most prominent writer/director of the 1990s. While technically daring for all its cartoonish blood and political incorrectness, it's much like the juvenile way rapper Eminem is daring. Both have indisputable talent, particularly as writers, but they poke stale, immature fun, as they're beholden to crappy, recycled coolness, and an insatiable desire to be liked by kids who enjoy the comfy childhood they didn't have. The movie is fixated on violence as an art form, and the various ways blood can spurt out of one's freshly cut stump. Why Tarantino is copping to this lowest common denominator like he's Michael Bay is a question only he could answer.""Vol. 1"" opens with a close-up of Thurman beaten and shot by a man named Bill, and left for dead on her wedding day, while the bridal party, including the groom, is strewn around her lifeless in the chapel. Thurman, know only as ""The Bride"" - her name is bleeped out for effect, to be revealed in ""Vol. 2"" - is comatose for four years; she awakens to find herself being raped by a trucker, and without the baby she carried on her wedding day.Though Tarantino inventively - yet predictably - shakes up the narrative, the Bride's mission is simple. Kill Bill, and the four assassins that helped him massacre her wedding party: Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Bill's brother Budd (Michael Madsen, saved for the next movie). The revenge against Vernita, now a housewife, and O-Ren, who has vanquished rivals to become the boss of Tokyo's organized crime, is the story of ""Vol.1."" Kung-fu vet Sonny Chiba also plays a large role in the middle of the film as Hattori Hanzo, retired sword maker whose steel is otherworldly.In an interview with Vanity Fair magazine, Tarantino vowed to take action scenes up a notch - he equated his work with Francis Ford Coppola's incredible ""Flight of the Valkyries"" sequence in ""Apocalypse Now."" These fights, which include guns, swords, knives, fists and a ball and chain are intricate, and have no shortage of blood, but they are not as impressive as anything in ""The Matrix Reloaded"" or ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" and, with a 70s chukka-wukka soundtrack blaring over the action, they are too daffy to be compared to Coppola's Vietnam movie.Tarantino's ""showstopper,"" a 45-minute bloodfest that culminates in the Bride/O-Ren showdown, works brilliantly for a stretch, as the Bride battles O-Ren's schoolgirl bodyguard, Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama) - she has the ball and chain - and then about one hundred samurai swordsmen in the middle of a two-story nightclub. But it settles into an endless parade of lost limbs and severed heads. And apparently Liu, who's a bit cold as O-Ren, can't swordfight a lick: Her fight against Thurman is rapidly over and presented in wide shot. Across four films, it's the first absolute letdown of Tarantino's career.And what had set him apart - sharp, hip dialogue - is basically wiped out of the picture in favor of monochromatic speeches and platitudes that pay homage to old Hong Kong kung-fu flicks. The movie's most inspired sequence, in fact, is its only fierce break from that homage: a powerful, beautiful work of Japanese anime that charts the childhood of the Bride's first nemesis, O-Ren, lending more depth the enemy than the entire movie invests in Thurman's character.The subject matter of ""Kill Bill"" is certainly pulpy and darkly funny, and Tarantino, with the chukka-wukka soundtrack and sight gags wants the movie to be entertaining. And it is.But visionary it is not. Nor is it revolutionary or substantial, despite the sad, dire nature of the Bride's quest.Because of her size and voice, Thurman is a fine vessel for this material, but she's too locked in Tarantino's tightly drawn, kung-fu universe boundaries. There is a distance between her and the audience, understandable given her circumstances, but it's hard to root for such a dour girl. A lot of this performance is doing, and Thurman is a well-engineered vehicle, lithe and acrobatic; so much so, in fact, that she overwhelms her competition. ""Kill Bill"" is not so much suspenseful as it is inevitable.Tarantino will always have his cult legion of admirers, and, judging by the virtuosity of this volume, ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" could be more impressive. But the director is one film away from becoming Brian DePalma, who lets us know just how many films he's seen while he erects his sterile obelisk in the corner. The best filmmakers - Scorsese, Spielberg, P.T. Anderson, Altman - consistently hammer away at new subjects while keeping in mind their individual styles. Tarantino might have boosted his ego with the goony fans he should have left behind, but his resume is not really any richer."	3.0	Fast, bloody and out of control, it's still a letdown.	2003-10-20	9	6	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2J0EFTGN6I1S9	Sarah B	There's been a lot of subtlety and art drained out of recent action movies-- there's nothing but shock value and explosions and terrible dialogue and plot holes.this movie will renew your faith in moviemaking. it tries new things and every shot is packed with intensity and subtelty. you will cheer for the mysterious main character and sit on the edge of your seat as a complete and intreguing story unfolds. the characters are round and nothing is sacrificed to produce this homage to what every action and kung fu flick wanted to be. there's no way to describe that tingly feeling you will have after the movie, even between every elegant shot and striking line passed between characters with deliberation and poignancy.if you get this move, make sure you see the second volume in theaters right now. it was originally made as one movie but cut in half. trust me, if you see the first one you won't be able to help yourself; you'll be sucked too far into this modern gilgamesh.	5.0	Returns something to the genre of action movies	2004-05-05	2	1	1

Did they not have enough money to preform these actual stunts so they drew them up?I understand the story of getting revenge since she was left for dead on her wedding day but it was not enough to keep my attention.Kill Bill left me wanting her to kill me so the movie could finally be over with.

The soundtrack is also very well selected.  The plot is the usual revenge story and Uma convincingly portrays the wronged assassin.  My only complaint is that Vol. 1 and 2 could have easily been combined into a single movie.  There are many slow and uninvolving parts in both volumes that should have been cut.  By separating the story into 2 installments, Tarantino effectively doubles his profits.

After my stomach settled I can testify that KILL BILL was a surreal adventure full of violence and bloodshed unlike any other. While it had me twisting and turning in my seat waiting for the blood to stop spilling, other members of the audience swiftly left the theatre in disgust. I am not a lover of adventure movies, martial arts, or extreme violence but I really enjoyed this movie. It was smart, innovative, and full of creativity (although Quentin Tarantino borrowed from many other genres to create this film). The Bride (Uma Thurman) excels in her role of seeking the ultimate revenge upon the members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad who left her for dead at her wedding alter. Although her real name is never revealed (it is bleeped out) the audience follows her quest from the United States to Japan to seek out and destroy her enemies. The fighting scenes are excellent and displayed in several different formats (color, black & white, and Japanese anime). It&#65533;s a wild ride, and one that followed me long after I left the theatre. Two thumbs up. Can&#65533;t wait until the sequel is released in Feb.	5.0	"""Silly rabbit, tricks are for kids"""	2003-10-13	1	0	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2PN7Z2VTHICL8	"Schtinky ""Schtinky"""	With everyone so focused on the blood and gore of this movie, I urge you to think beyond the blood; think of a favorite Japanese graphic novel brought to life.  Think of the ultimate revenge fantasy, where you are so very bad @ss that no one can touch you.  Think invincible, brutally gifted with weapons, and fueled by hate beyond death.Kill Bill is a visually stunning treat for the eyes, and ears, of its viewers; even the blood is overdone in its gushing fountains and sprinkler type sprays.  The background story of O'Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) is entirely done in Anime; expertly done I might add.  Tarentino uses cinematography to its best advantage in this film; stop action shots, slow motion, down angle shots, B&amp;W during the big fight, and the battle in the snow between O'Ren Ishii and The Bride is the tastiest eye candy fight scene I have seen in a very long time.Even down to costume design, Kill Bill stimulates the visual core of your brain even better than the original Matrix.  Direction, choreography, soundtrack, editing, production, acting, everything combines to make one of the greatest revenge fantasies ever filmed.  Really, I'm not even a huge Tarentino fan, and  I still found myself riveted to the screen, even starting the movie over again after my first viewing.The actresses and actors deserve special mention of their own.  Forget Uma Thurman as the pretty little innocent we saw her as in Dangerous Liaisons, she is one hard fighting woman as The Bride, and really mastered the art of sword fighting for her role in this movie.  She does a superb job.  Lucy Liu is both beautiful and dangerous in her role as O'Ren Ishii, her voice as soft as rose petals and her sting as deadly as the Cottonmouth's bite, thus her code name from the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.  Her eyes will quite literally transfix you, you will feel her staring into your soul and know that she would love to see the color of your blood.Also Exceptional in their supporting roles are Vivica Fox and Darryl Hannah, two more beautiful ladies that we never considered dangerous until now.  Unknown in America for any acting is young Chiaki Kuriyama, who plays O'Ren's 17 year old bodyguard GoGo Yubari, a baby faced schoolgirl with dead eyes and a psychotic mind.  And Sonny Chiba, long time veteran of Japanese cinema plays Hattori Hanzo, a retired sword maker.Don't miss the amazing snow-scene fight, the expertly done anime, and the visual and audio treat that is Kill Bill.  Favorite Line?  The Bride, after kicking everyone's hinder at the House Of Blue Leaves, shouts down to them from the balcony, &quot;Those of you lucky enough to have your lives take them with you. However, leave the limbs you've lost. They belong to me now.&quot;Enjoy!	5.0	Revenge fantasy soars far above Tarantino's other works	2004-05-23	4	3	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3FWM76OIIGYXE	Scott Feuless	When hollywood doesn't know how to capture an audience with anything intelligent or unique, they can always resort to the cheapest and easiest trick in the book.  Just shock the audience.  Show them something more repulsive or twisted than they've seen before.  It's easy to do, and it always buys a few good reviews from people who think anything that shocks them must be art.The fight scenes in this movie are less imaginative than what you can see at home in Alias or Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but they add ridiculous amounts of blood to please the small minded serial killer wannabes out there.  No realism - just characters that never go into shock or bleed to death.  This movie carries on Hollywood's seeming goal of desensitizing the public to any kind of atrocity - perhaps to help make the real atrocities in the world more pallatable for us.

I expected, from the few trailers I saw (this film was advertised much on paper, little on television here in the Czech Republic) I expected it to be a Charlie's Angels-esque comedy/action film. Then a friend saw it and told me it was stupid, so I thought that is was a STUPID comedy/action film. When I went, I was proven wrong. While at the theater, I must confess I had to leave several times, as I am not accumstomed to nor was I prepared for this level of violence. But I kept coming back in after only a few minutes of missing the screen ( i could still hear the sound). I said to a friend that it was ""a surrealistically dark gore-fest of macabre art forms"" or somesuch and I stand by it. In the theaters, I thought it was a crime to make a movie such as this. BUT...after i left the theater and I began to replay it in my mind, I realized that this is one of the most artistically excellent films I have ever seen. Yes, it is bloody. Overly bloody. BUt I don't see it as distasteful, immature, or comedy. It's an artistic statement. Everything, the music, cinematography, special effects, were all an excercise in artistic ability. Torentino is beyond a shadow of a doubt one of the most brilliant artists I have ever seen at work, and this is the only one of his films I have seen thusfar. The anime sequence is appalling, but that's an artistic statement, mixng the innocense of cartoon animation with horrific violence. I know he's not the first to do it. But he has perfectly packaged a mixture of every artistic form I can imagine, except possibly for religious imagery, I don't remember. It's not a goth-art thing, but ALL other artforms are encompassed in this film (except for classical art). Anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing the second film. Torentino has earned my deep respect as a director and an artist.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2CW1R89Q4WJ5S	"S. D Haynie ""girlranger"""	The samarai scene between the two ex-assassins was so beautiful I felt emotional.  Honestly, I thought I might start crying.  This movie is beautiful and powerful.  I don't particularly care for all the extra blood that comes literally spurting out of peoples' headless necks.  I'm not a comic book fan by any stretch.  I can, however, relate to the idea of wanting to seek revenge for someone killing my groom, my wedding party, and my baby (unborn, no less). She's a bad bad fighter.  She really is.  The samarai sword scenes are amazing.  I'm a female, by the way, although this comes off as a male movie.  I recommend this flick.  The storyline is good.  The characters are developed.  They are not shallow; they are just quiet. Uma plays off being a stupid American tourist in Japan quite well; she also pulls off the ex-assassin bit very well.It's gory.  Don't watch it with your three year old.	5.0	This movie had some beautiful scenes	2004-08-19	3	1	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AONNVIQXNOUGG	Sean Devlin	"As a massive Tarantino fan, I will not try and sugarcoat ""kill Bill"" for the few of you who havent seen it, its certainly Tarantinos weakest film yet. It doesnt contain the suspense of ""Reservoir Dogs"", the ultra cool interlocks of ""Pulp Fiction"" or the sheer watchability of ""Jackie brown"". But, as many a fan will tell you, a under-par Tarantino film is still twice as good as most Jerry Bruckheimer productions (bar ""The Rock"" and ""Pirates of Carribeann"").The story is simple, former assaasin who. on her wedding day, is shot in the head, along with all the guests, by her former colleagues (Lucy Liu, Vivica A Fox, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah) and her boss, Bill. She also loses her unborn child. 45 years later shge wakes up in coma, and sets out for revenge, and by revenge I mean BLOODY RETRIBUTION.So armed with a legendary Hitori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba) sword begins her quest with O-Ren Ishi (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A Fox).On the excitment side, Kill Bill Vol 1 delivers by the bucket load, an amzing confrontation with a army known as the Crazy 88 followed by the stunning samurai battle with O-Ren Ishi in the snow. Watch the red hit white. *That means blood and snow*.Also, Uma Thurman's performance is excellent, you have to wonder why she is most under rated actresses in Hollywood.The direction is varied, however. Some things are truly fantastic, like the colours the film uses and some sound effects.Its hard to judge one half of a film, but this really is action over story, and the film could have done with a bit more of Michael Madsen or David Carridine (Bill).Nevertheless, gret rental material, and of course, perfect if you want to see Kill Bill Vol 2."	4.0	Not the Tarantino we know and love	2004-09-18	2	0	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1R9GZ8FC44MF5	"Sean ""Dragon Ninja"""	I personally think Vol 2 is better, but this one certainly is not bad at all.  This one is a stylish action packed revenge story, with good performances and is lots of fun.  The second one is more of a character driven drama, with 2 cool fights, and a brief but still well choreographed fight between Bill and the bride.  Also i must say that apart the movies are great, but if they were put together, which they will be soon, they would be 10 times greater.  I a waiting for the merged dvd because i would prefer watchin the whole bloody affair all at once, hint hint, (thats what the combined version is going to be called).  I give this movie a 9 out of a 10, i thought the reference to pimping out the bride while she is in her coma was kind of stupid, but everything else kicks a$$, esspecially the gogo fight.	5.0	Vol 1 action, Vol 2 drama.	2004-08-06	4	3	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2A7CI7OWBOI3A	"Sean E. M. Dence ""optimus_sean"""	Kill Bill was great. It was better than Pulp Fiction. I don't know why I liked it so much but it was just really exciting and funny and nicely edited. The gore was extreme and some of the blood was cartoonish and the action was a little tongue-and-cheeck but the sword fighting scenes were the best sword fighting scenes that I've ever seen.Kill Bill is so incredibly unique because it's the first action movie I've ever seen that were a combination of so many other genres. It was like a huge tribute to comic books, Anime, westerns, explotation films, Psychedelic films and Kung-Fu flicks. The characters and the dialogue were entertaining and the music was also good. It fit so well with the picture!Uma Thurman was really great in her performance. She's like a female Johnny Depp in the way that she becomes characters with such ease. She really improved a already great film. My only complaint is Bill. They have that weird guy from that lame Kung-Fu series. The only person as weird or as creepy as him is Christopher Lambert. Thank goodness he wasn't in the flick. If you love Pulp Fiction and Quentin's films then you will like this one. It's a lot of fun. It, however, is not for the faint of heart. Some of the violence gets a little sadistic in the Yakuza scenes.I liked the film so much I might see it again!

In short I believe Hollywood doesn't like Tarantino which is why the advertising for this movie is very flaky and makes it look like a comedy. Truth is, is that Kill Bill is a profound story, combining elements of Japanese and Chinese culture in a Western-styled film. It's as if Tarantino is the successor of Sergio Leone and is able to show it perfectly in his films. Hollywood doesn't like Tarantino because his movies are probably one of the best in cinema, and they just don't want him that popular.If one likes Western-, Samurai-, or crime-styled films with Leone's taste, they REALLY should own this film.	5.0	A brief review on the film, not the product itself	2014-01-06	0	0	0

They could have added some more to the movie but it was alright anyway and it makes you want to watch the sequel. The movie did have some good fight scenes though. Overall it was pretty interesting to watch so if you are looking for a good action movie, this is a good one to see. However, warning, this is not for the faint of heart. There is much blood and gore.  But if you don't mind watching someone getting their head chopped off and then seeing the blood spill out of their lifeless body then by all means this is the movie for you. By the way all of the blood looks extremely fake and seems to be made the same way the blood was made for the comic book scenes. What a pity.	3.0	Kill Bill bleeds over the screen	2005-07-10	3	1	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A72120TZV1MTF	S E R I K O N	The guy is very creative in displaying a story in a very original structure and media.  Kill Bill is a cult movie fan's greatest dream come true.  Everything is in there from good old Western Coybow movies to the cinema of the east slapped together.  For the sterotypical &quot;white&quot; person who only consumes the blockbuster hits of what ever popoular trend is out, this movie may appear silly or confusing to a degree of laughter.  Thats the beauty of this movie, it shows us which movie watchers are out there.  In the theaters I caught a lot of white people laughing at the asian sequences of the film and they were also dumbfounded by the special appearances of the actors from Wild Zero, Ichi the Killer, Battle Royale, and Suicide Circle to name a few.  (i was hoping to see Tekashi Kitano) The only special appearnce of a star they would know is &quot;David carra..whats his name...? the guys from that Kung-Fu show...yeah.&quot;  A lot of people failed to see the element of honor that was displayed in both films between characters which was a very beautiful element.  The action sequences were directed very well so that it made up for a lot of the actor martial arts flaws such as akward positions and hyper extended punches, so there are little moments killed.One sad thing though is that Kill Bill Vol.2 had a trailer for the 2002 film HERO, which is now going to hit theaters here that did it injustes.  They stated that the movie was presented by Quentin Tarantino, but I've overheard many reactions of people thinking that it is directed by Quentin Tarantino rather than the truth (Zhang Yimou).  Plus the trailer gave the art film a false representation of an epic war film, many may be disapointed.  So are movies like Kill Bill building bridges with Hollywood and Asia or are they just going to jokingly stereotype Asian films and cuture in an unfair way?  Fans and crowds shall tell in time.Oh and by the way, I don't want to sound like &quot;white&quot; people are not cool, I use the term &quot;white&quot; for the typical stereotyping day by day american.  As far as stereotypes go, sometimes people enjoy becoming part of it and making it obviously true.  I look forward to one day the stereotypes are non existant and everyhting in around our lives is understood for what it is and not what it looks like on the surface.	5.0	Quentin Tarantino's Tribute &amp;...	2004-05-09	3	2	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3EM4511SYC27N	"""seriussam10"""	Apart from the great cinematography, superb soundtrack, and thoroughly entertaining, beautifully romanticisized violence, this movie is just a B movie with a finely polished veneer. To say that the plot is lacking would be rather kind. Not only is it lacking, I have seen hundreds of martial arts/animes that have the same premise, and this movie didn't really stick out to me. Sure there are lots of dialogues and colorful characters that Terantino fans will love, but it just isn't a great movie. Entertaining as hell, but not a great movie. I hate to say it, but Terantino's best movie is, and always will be, Pulp Fiction. I wish it wasn't so, he is so damn likeable and stylish, but it's the sad truth.	2.0	A Great B  Movie Correlates to an Average Movie	2004-03-08	13	0	13
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A22S8IZ3MOM65M	"Seth Miller ""Lice is Macho"""	"I'll admit it. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a film for film lovers all the way through its core. Its a `movie for guys who likes movies,' if you will. I'll also be the first to admit that I didn't catch 3/4ths of the references to the film and television programs that Tarantino is paying homage to in this delightfully tacky and lovingly geeky story. One thing is certain though. Tarantino has seen more post-Kurosawa samurai films, spaghetti westerns, and anime features then the disembodied limbs he has spewing from every minute of Kill Bill - and he LOVES them. Judging by how much fun I had watching Kill Bill Vol. 1, I am inclined to think that I, too, just may be a bigger geek than my suave ways indicate.The thing that is so brilliant about Kill Bill is that it is so unabashedly indulgent, so completely full of ultra-cool style and highly imaginative cinematography, that it is nearly impossible to share in its joy. The film itself proves that content does not always have to outweigh style. In fact, style can itself be content.Yes, its true, many will be offended by this wildly grotesque and intensely violent film. Understandably so, I say. There is far more blood in Kill Bill then there are false endings in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. But the movie is placed into such an intense fantasy world, it is hard to imagine it actually happening to real people in real time. Still, those that suspect that they will be offended probably will, and should steer clear.However, those that find this movie intriguing should take the plunge. Its dizzying, witty, and beautiful in its own `Tarantino-esque' way. Not to mention a soundtrack to disembowel all others this year featuring cheesy and hyper fight tracks and a moody and crooning Nancy Sinatra. Come to think of it, Sinatra's ""Bang Bang (my baby shot me down),"" over the opening titles gives the perfect feel for the film as a whole. If the first 2 minutes excite you, then you're in for a ride. If the first 2 minutes leave you feeling agitated, you might want to consider finding a more calm way to spend an hour and a half.

The fighting finale would match, or beat, the 'Burly Brawl' from Matrix Reloaded. But sadly that's about all going for the movie.Sure, it's a typical Tarantino visual feast with delicious camera shots from wicked angles. And yes, as a martial arts movie it may hang with the top of the tops (was it just me or did anyone notice ""Crouching Tiger"" influences too?)But his 4th film nowhere near matches the sheer class of Jackie Brown or Pulp Fiction. Once the hype has faded, I am sure people'll realise how mediocre this film really is, stylish maybe, original somewhat, but a boring script that shows little direction.What's most worrisome is that this tripe should be long enough to be cut into two bits. Perhaps the stuff that cults are made of, but a disappointing movie overall.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A33K69BEF5QA0S	Shawn Ankersen	This movie is just the epitome of grindhouse action and style. It pulls so many elements from so many other films, and somehow makes them better. The visuals are amazing, and Tarantino's mastery of color and composition really shine through, just like Pulp Fiction. I know many people say that he copies shots exactly out of older films, but so do many other directors, and chances are most shots anyone is about to do, unless they do a long-take, it has already been done. So, for the cinematic critics out there (and I know I need not say this because this movie has been analyzed for years) the long takes in O-Ren Ishii's place are amazing. Watch it.Just bought this on Blu-Ray for $4--be careful, the rental version on Amazon is 480p, standard def, so for the best experience I would download an HD version or buy it on Blu-Ray. The Blu-Ray came with a free rental, (sweet!) but as I said, it's only 480p. Now that I've watched it again, I'll have something to compare the Blu-Ray to. If it's anything like Pulp Fiction's (again, $4!) Blu-ray, it will be a world of difference. Every pore and imperfection...gorgeous to say the least.I think this is the better of the two Bill movies; the second is really good but this one is just more fun, and I personally think the music is better, which was a big factor for me.	5.0	In My Opinion, Tarantino's best!	2012-11-28	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2B7BUH8834Y6M	"Shelley Gammon ""Geek"""	"This is definitely one of the bloodiest films I have ever seen - yet after the film ended, I was already anxiously awaiting Volume 2's debut in theaters.  Like all things Tarantino, ""Kill Bill, Volume 1,"" is unlike any movie you've ever seen - even though it borrows elements from every B movie ever made.  Unlike the seat-squirming ear-removal scene in Tarantino's ""Resevoir Dogs,"" the ultra blood-spattering violence in""Kill Bill"" is less disturbing simply because it's more flashy and less intimate in nature... not to mention that everyone who ends up on the wrong side of a bullet, blunt instrument, knife or Samuri sword has it coming in a big way.The film opens with Uma Thurman's heavy breathing... she is about 8 and a half months pregnant, wearing a white wedding dress... and she is the only surviving member of a wedding party that has been mowed down by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (note the acronym would be ""DiVAS""), including Lucy Liu, a Chinese American who is now a king-pin in the Japanese underworld.Thurman's character (whose name we don't know, because it's always bleeped out) is shot in the head by the unseen Bill (David Carradine) but miraculously survives, albeit in a coma, for four years.She bolts up 4 years later, realizes what has happened to her, and she goes on a globe-trotting rampage, exacting justice for the unborn baby she lost and the injustice of a wedding day gone bad.When I say this movie is bloody, I don't mean that you see a few people get shot... people are dismembered left and right to such a degree, you would need to pause the film and get a calculator to count the severed limbs. People get disfigured, decapitated and otherwise really eviscerated.Despite this unbelievable level of violence, the film has a grotesque kind of beauty... those who get dismembered or killed appear to have it coming (as awful as that is to even fathom), and the choreography, intelligence and humor are an incredible, palpable blend of yummy film.The film leaves many unanswered questions about what made Bill put the hit on  Thurman's mysteriously yet-to-be-named character, what happened to her unborn child and how she got so skilled at butt-kicking and sword wielding... leaving the viewer pining for the conclusion in the next volume.Due to the mature themes, excrutiatingly horrific violence and language that can peel rust off old tools, this film isn't for children, victims of violent crime or those with weak constitutions."	5.0	bloody incredible	2003-12-02	5	2	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A13IKSGDYNBNQS	S J Buck	Opening with 1970's style 'Our Feature Presentation' and then you are straight into a roller coaster of a film. Yes it is violent, and there is a lot of blood. But its very well done and of course a homage to the films that Tarantino grew up with in the 60's and 70's. Spagetti westerns, Kung-Fu movies are all referenced in images and the soundtrack. Spot Sonny Shiba as the greatest sword maker ever.A third of the way through the film we get an anime section as well. Tarantino may be a fan of anime, but watching this sequence again recently I realised how incredibly violent it is. The whole film is an adult comic strip anyway, but this section is so violent that maybe Tarantino just decided to do it animated to avoid censorship problems. Whatever it doesn't matter, it works.This is, as you would expect, well directed and fantastic entertainment. The performances from the cast are all good or better.BTW there is really no point in buying this DVD without buying vol 2 at the same time. The reason it only gets 4 stars?

After my second viewing I realized how dazzling and inovative the movie really is. The movie still has some vises that I can't get over.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1392N8VVOD1AV	"""skubasteve"""	"First off, let me state that while I have enjoyed all of his movies, I have not, until now considered myelf a ""Quentin Taratino fan.""  Second, I must elaborate on what one other reviewer wrote; the ladies of KILL BILL's Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (aka. DiVAS) would eat Charlie's Angels for breakfast with a side of wheat toast and a glass of orange juice.  If you want an action movie with REAL women, see KILL BILL.  The ladies of Quentin Tarantino's latest picture are beautiful without ridiculously tight or revealing costumes.  They are sexy without laughable, double ententre dialogue.  These women smart, strong, and dangerous.At it's heart KILL BILL is a simple revenge-action picture (albeit a excellent one).  However, the film centers around the best-written female characters that Hollywood has seen in the last 25 years.  And not one or two, but many.KILL BILL is a glorious synthesis of the Spaghetti Western, the Hong Kong Action Flick, Japanese Anime, the Samurai films of Kurosawa, the Mob Movie, and even a touch of the Errol Flynn Swashbuckler, from across the entire history of cinema.  It is not a complex, emotional film, but a relentlessly enjoyable homage to every ""popcorn movie"" made before it.  Plus Tarantino manages to add an unprecendented layer to these genres: women.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3VRP9IKXK0I4Q	"""slivek"""	This movie is really dull. I saw it in the theater and wished I had a remote. Let's have a long scene where Uma Thurman pretends that she can't speak Japanese but maybe she really can even though she can't even pronounce &quot;yakuza&quot; correctly. Let's have this go on for five minutes and then find out that it is completely unimportant and irrelevant to the story. What fun. There's a reason those bad kung fu movies were only shown in &quot;grindhouses&quot; - they were crappy and very few people wanted to see them. Okay, let's be cool and say that bad is good, and pretend we're the first ever to say that things are relative. That will really show our parents, huh? This is a movie for fourteen year old boys.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AH4RF780RHG5U	sloc234	Quentin Tarantino's films have always been propelled by great writing. The dialogue between characters is always unique and is impossible to beat. Few movies have come close to duplicating the likes of the writing in Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. In Kill Bill, Tarantino's genius definitely shows. It's the story of The Bride, whose wedding was massacred by her former business partners.  Now, after waking up from a 4-year coma, she is out to get bloody revenge. Of the two volumes, Volume 1 is mostly dedicated to paying  homage to older asian martial arts films and the like. It's filled with blood, gore, over-the-top violence, frequent dismemberment, and some decapitations. The film's violence turned away many people to watching it, as some of it is very disturbing. The character study and plot are less explored in volume, because Quentin has saved that for Volume 2. Having seen Volume 2, I can say that it is a better film than the first,  but Volume 1 stil appeals to many people, and is still very entertaining to watch if one isn't bothered by excessive violence. 5 stars, Very entertaining.Sidenote: Before making your judgement on Kill Bill as a whole, make sure that you watch both volumes. Volume 2 really focuses more on the story and less on the violence.	5.0	The 4th Film by Quentin Tarantino	2004-08-02	15	14	1

A pregnant bride who wanted out of the life as a killer, but Bill has other ideas, and sends the hit squad to finish her off.  Well so they thought.  Black Mamba is alive after being in a coma, she realizes her baby is gone, and she is out to get everyone who tried to kill her.  The fighting is gorey, bloody, and just action packed.  How ironic that copperhead (Viveca) has a weapon in a box of Kaboom cereal.  Uma does some serious mind over matter exercises to get her lower extremities to work so she can walk and drive!!!One of my favorite scenes is the animation scene showing Oren Ishii?s life.  The crazy 88's scene is my absolute favorite scene in the movie that I watch over and over on my DVD.  I can never get tired of that scene.  I loved how you heard that music when Black mamba spotted a revenge victim.  You knew the fighting was about to start.  GoGo was intense with her metal ball weapon.  Despite the crazy 88's Black Mama did not let anything get in way of getting to Oren Ishii her main target.  This movie is phenomenal and I'm amazed some people did not enjoy this movie.

I then think to myself how in the world can this be? Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest film makers of all time. I loved Pulp Fiction for example, it is one of the most influential movies of the 90s. Some speak of violence or gore in the film with the same lack of understanding or ignorance. Tarantino is trying to fuse Japanese Yakuza and Samurai movies, water it down till its palatable to a U.S. audience to present a masterpiece. Seems like all the great directors whom you all love have a great respect for Asian cultures, Lucas with his Jedi or should we say Samurai or Spielberg with Road to Perdition, its been done before with Lone Wolf and Cub. Tarantino?s ability to stylize his film with music and anime is a respectfully refreshing new concept in American cinema has gone un matched in originality. This movie is a must buy.	5.0	Awesome- if you still have a functioning imagination	2004-07-20	2	2	0

It's the visual imagery and sheer brilliance of directing that's just amazing about this film!  Thurman fits the bill (no pun intended) as the super hero.  The supporting cast is great!

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2LICSQ2IFE3C5	"SPM ""scott_maykrantz"""	"Tarantino made a smart move when he decided to film a two-part martial arts movie. In the wake of the Matrix films and Lord of the Rings, he could cut his four-hour flick in half and release it 6 months apart. Ten years ago, he might not have been able to. By cutting it in half, he took a long, rambling movie and turned it into two tight movies. This DVD, the first part, moves fast. It's funny, violent, and full of memorable scenes and images.Another reason it's such a smart move: Tarantino is a movie geek, so he can throw in dozens of ""homages"" to his favorite kung fu movies in this movie. If you get the references (like Uma wearing Bruce Lee's yellow motorcycle outfit) that's great. If not, you don't miss out on anything essential.Tarantino is still mixing up the sequence of events, telling the story out of order, and it still works. The audience can follow along the first time, but the movie is better the second or third time, when you have a better idea of who's who and what's going on. In Pulp Fiction, the out-of-order sequence puts you off-balance. This time, he's so good at it, you can't imagine telling the story any other way.Tarantino challenged himself in Kill Bill to shoot great action sequences, and he succeeded. The fights are the high points. They are suspenseful, intercut with humor and dialogue, and too stylized to be taken seriously. The swordfight at the end is fantastic, even if you only pay attention to the lighting. (Which brings me to Robert Richardson, the cinematographer for Kill Bill. Best known for his work on Natural Born Killers and other Oliver Stone movies, he's the guy who puts the glowing light behind everyone. Overhead lights shimmer in the hair of actors, and windows bleed light around the edges. It's a nice effect.)You can't go wrong with this film. Although the DVD doesn't have a lot of extras, the movie itself is worth it. Tarantino has developed his directing and writing style, making it simpler without losing any of his trademarks: the Seinfeld-like conversations, the long takes, the camera-in-the-trunk point of view, sudden bursts of violence, and fake product placement. This is his fourth film and he hasn't peaked yet. He's four for four.."	5.0	U and Q do Kung Fu	2004-04-17	0	0	0

Greetings my loyal constituency, and welcome to musings of a - oh no! gasp! shriek! - MIDDLE-AGED white gal.  Because of Uma Thurman and her status as a proud big-boned female I knew this movie was a must-see.  Sure enough, she manages to steal the show with her ninjitsu kicking and flipping.  But for a teenage and a pre-teen girl, yes, both budding neo-feminists (as I), the movie will make you groan over the VIOLENT images.  I'll never watch the Volume 2 because I know it is only more of the same lowest-common-denominator crud.  To their credit, my friend's girls came out gagging over the bloody scenes vividly rendered in the works of Quentin Tarantino and I took them to Friendly's for a fried Apple Muffin with enough pure butter to clog their arteries permanently.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3DY46ZABF4CMQ	"S. Sarhan ""matured reviewer"""	Kill Bill is an amazing spectacle directed by the best filmmaker in Hollywood today, Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs), and starring Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction), David Carradine (Death Race 2000), Vivica A. Fox (Independence Day), Daryl Hannah (Wall Street), Lucy Liu (Lucky Number Slevin), and Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs).Kill Bill is a revenge tale that wastes no time in delivering a heavy dosage of blood, Samurai swords, and quirky dialogue. From the opening credit scene, we are introduced to the blood-splattered and very pregnant 'The Bride', or Black Mamba, played by Thurman, all beaten up and unconscious. Not even a minute later, The Bride confronts the first of the 5 people who betrayed and attempted to kill her, Vernita Green, played by Fox. The bloody battle goes down in Green's lovely home before her daughter returns from school and interrupts them. This is just one example of how Kill Bill, or shall I say Tarantino, mixes humor with hardcore violence. It turns out that The Bride used to be in a group of professional killers called the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, or DiVAS, that, besides Green, included the leader of the pack Bill, played by Carradine, a one-eyed blonde maniac named Elle Driver, played by Hannah, a Japanese gang leader named O-Ren Ishii, played by Liu, and Bill's trailer dwelling brother Bud, played by Madsen. The Bride wants to kill each and every one of them starting with Vernita, then Ishii, then Bud, and Elle, then, finally, the head honcho Bill.Kill Bill Volume 1 covers The Bride's revenge spree that takes on only the first two characters. However, with a character background study on Ishii, shot in animation, and The Bride traveling to Okinawa to meet Hattori Hanzo, an infamous Japanese-steel sword maker, played by legendary Samurai-movie actor Sonny Chiba, so he can build her the most fatal weapon on earth, extends the movie's running time to over 2 hours. The other three on The Bride's list are taken care of in the equally long and outstanding Volume 2.Kill Bill has been hailed by many critics as Quentin Tarantino's best work since 1994's Oscar winning Pulp Fiction. It is undeniably his bloodiest film to date, and one of the most brilliant films, along with it's sequel, of the first decade of the millennium.RecommendedA	5.0	...a heavy dosage of blood, Samurai swords, and quirky dialogue	2003-11-26	0	0	0

Uma Thurman is headlined as a samurai sword wielding, revenge-seeking assassin.  Playing on the old Japanese samurai movies, it even begins with the opening credits looking like an old-time movie.  The all-star cast includes Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, and perhaps a not so surprising person playing Bill.  The movie intercuts between flashbacks in black-and-white that explain the backstory and current day slasher scenes. Overall, an entertaining movie.	5.0	Tarantino at his best	2014-04-25	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2CT2SA6KFE8GC	"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk"""	Mr. Tarantino is a man who obviously loves movies.....LOVES movies.  All the better still, he loves good movies.  If other film directors loved movies as much as Tarantino we would have some good flicks out there, and a minimum of Michael Bays and Zack Snyders.  Tarantino sets out to make the kinds of films that he loves, but with his own personal twist.  Kill Bill is obviously a labor of love given Tarantino's passion for 70s kung fu flicks.  I love kung fu flicks too, not as much as Tarantino(though I do rival him in our love for horror flicks), but I know enough to get all of the homages in this film.  You have to go into this expecting a movie that's not 100% serious and has all of that 70s cinema corniness on purpose.  Lets face it, no major studio would have released this film if any other director had made it-this film is a little more violent, zany and bizarre for the average 2 Fast 2 Furious crowd.  It's a good thing Tarantino did do this or it would have just been an obscure cult hit.  Tarantino shows he can do action sequences quite well-he hasn't done much of that in the past.  The martial arts sequences are well done, not that Matrix-slo-mo crap.  Uma Thurman looks like she really knows her stuff, though I'm sure she really doesn't know martial arts.  I'm not a big Uma Thurman fan, but that takes a back seat when watching this film.  Similar to Alice In Wonderland, though she may be the main character, it's all the other characters along the way that are cool.  And what is Tarantino's obsession with Uma Thurman's feet?  First Pulp Fiction, now here.  Uma Thurman's got some nasty feet, folks!  I don't know why we need to have so many long closeups of them.  I can tell you I'm sure not gonna risk getting thrown out a window for massaging those feet.  The rest of the cast is great though.  Tarantino likes using actors he admires, not just casting Vin Diesel for a quick buck.  Usually he tends to revive an old career in the process.  Look at Travolta, Pam Grier and now, David Carradine.  Plus we get to see Daryl Hannah as a villian.  I've always liked her.  Some great cameos too by Gordon Liu and Sonny Chiba.  Basically, I'm recommending this film very highly coz you won't be seeing many like it.  Sure, the plot is no different than a cheap Seagal movie, but this film makes up for it with storytelling, style, gore and action.  So, as a favor to me, think twice before renting crud like XXX or Dorque.	5.0	A Great Tribute To A Great Genre	2004-05-27	2	0	2

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3LXKO2S6G2DBI	"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant"""	With &quot;Kill Bill, Volume One,&quot; Quentin Tarantino, whose near-miss &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; deserves more audience acclaim than it gets, finally manages to make a bonafide film, as opposed to bloody, low-budget romps like the vastly overrated &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and the better but stagey &quot;Reservoir Dogs.&quot;  Here, he confidently frames scenes, uses music and dialogue to maximum effect, and knows when to back off and let his actors carry scenes that are truly cinematic (even if they, too, seem lifted from &quot;Thunderball,&quot; &quot;Goldfinger,&quot; and any number of martial arts movies and 60s westerns).  Of course, those of us old enough to recall that American television pretty much churned out watered-down versions of this stuff every week may wonder what the fuss is all about and why the heck it takes so long to make it, but compared to most so-called films today, &quot;Kill Bill, Volume One&quot; shows a level of competence that is generally lacking.  The plot--if there is one--is simple:  An assassin known here only as &quot;The Bride&quot; (played with exceptional vigor by Amazonian Uma Thurman) seeks revenge against her former comrades, whose death squad turns her wedding rehearsal into a massacre.  Their leader--the enigmatic &quot;Bill&quot;--is voiced by 70s favorite David Carradine with gravelly menace, reminding us that too many great actors (including Sonny Chiba and Gordon Liu) have to suffer through lousy roles before finding their mark.  Refusing to abandon his patchwork approach to story-telling, Tarantino nonetheless keeps the pace of his film high-octane, even in more thoughtful moments, bridging the otherwise disjointed elements nicely, and it is to his credit that each scene is charged with emotional electricity--and enough action to satisfy even the most jaded of moviegoers.  Though &quot;Kill Bill, Volume Two&quot; features much more and better character development, not much in the sequel comes close to eclipsing the sheer adrenaline of this film's climax--nor the sheer beauty of being transformed, the way film should, from one environment to the next, here with just the sliding of a paper door.  It's also to Tarantino's credit that the film loses something in the transfer from large to small screen, something rare in contemporary movies, which generally seem like big TV shows.  His vision is such pure cinema that my only real gripe is that on the small screen we can't quite savor it the same way.	5.0	Excellent Film, but See It on the Big Screen	2004-04-24	2	1	1

I just love this film and Uma is sooo hot. She is way hotter than those bimbos Paris, Britney, Christina, Electra and Pamela combined.

Just know that it proves that you truly are the moron that people have always said you are.	1.0	As bad as I always thought it would be	2014-04-24	4	1	3
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	When will Amazon ever separate reviews of BluRay discs from those of the Standard Definition DVDs? When will most reviewers stop writing book report summaries of the plot and their opinions of the acting. If I am interested in buying a blu ray DVD it is because I have already seen the movie and liked it and may already have it on a Standard DVD and want to know of the quality of the BD transfer.I do have Kill Bill vol 1 on a Standard Def version and have just bought the Blu Ray version.  As a movie, 5 stars.  As a Blu Ray, only 3 and lucky to get that.  The standard dvd had DTS 5.1 audio and DTS audio has always been good. The blu ray version has  lossless PCM audio which is very good.  However, despite good use of the front sound stage, especially for the audio score, there is very little use of the rears when there really could have been, most specifically when our heroine is fighting the Crazy 88s who have surrounded her in the club.  There should have been tons of directional discreet audio coming out there but there wasn't.  I do have a very high end esoteric home theater so I consider myself more attuned to the audio directionality than most but was disappointed in the audio editing.The video transfer was a huge disappointment.  While I saw no artifacting, aliasing or even grain for that matter, the entire film looks, for the most part, dull.  This is one of those  transfers where there really is no difference between the video palate from the Standard Def version to the Blu Ray version.  There are far too many scenes in this movie where the colors should be popping yet they stay in the kernel.  And that is the reason why I gave this 5 star movie only 3 stars. Even the extras are the same on Blu Ray as opposed to the Standard DVD .  Bottom line, if you don't already have Kill Bill vol 1 on DVD, then, of course buy the Blu Ray version as they are always inexpensively priced.  If you do already have it, you really won't see or hear much difference.Tomorrow I look at Kill Bill Vol 2.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks	3.0	Kill Bill vol 1 on Blu Ray	2012-08-16	17	14	3
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2RHQMV5GD18Z8	Steven Aldersley	Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (Action, Crime)Directed by Quentin TarantinoStarring Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu and Daryl HannahDisney / Buena Vista | 2003 | 111 min | Rated R | Released Sep 09, 2008Video:Video codec: MPEG-4 AVCVideo resolution: 1080pAspect ratio: 2.40:1Audio:English: LPCM 5.1 (48kHz, 16-bit)English: Dolby Digital 5.1French: Dolby Digital 5.1Subtitles:English SDH, Cantonese, Korean, Japanese, SpanishDisc:Single 50GB Blu-ray DiscThe Film 5/5I'm a big fan of Chungking Express and remember reading that Quentin Tarantino cries when he watches it because he loves it so much. That's how I feel when I watch the two Kill Bill movies. Within three minutes, I hear Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down) and I'm transported into another world. It reminds me of what I'm in for. Every choice that Tarantino makes, from story, to dialogue and music, is absolutely perfect. I feel like he made this film with me in mind.Uma Thurman was born to play the role of The Bride. I'm still not sure how she managed to keep a straight face as she spoke the dialogue.It took me five years to bother seeing Kill Bill because I don't embrace things with senseless violence. The movie suggests extreme violence, but shows hardly any of it, just the result. The cuts are convincing and have the same effect as if you had seen the violent acts. I expected Thurman to prance around with a samurai sword, hacking people to pieces. In fact, she pretty much does, but there's so much more to the story.First of all, she makes me care. Her back story makes her actions seem justified, but I also feel pity for O-Ren Ishii (Liu) when we see what happened to her when she was a child (brilliantly portrayed anime style). The film uses a number of tricks such as stills, black and white, slow motion, silhouettes, changing aspect ratios, and extreme close-ups. The pacing, humor, drama and action all seem to be woven together perfectly.Kill Bill is a simple story of revenge. We learn in the opening scene that The Bride was shot in the head at her wedding rehearsal and spent four years in a coma as a result. The story isn't linear, so the first person we see her kill is actually second on her Death List. Although it reveals that she successfully killed O-Ren Ishii by showing a line through her name, none of the tension is lost when we are shown their epic battle.We see The Bride recover from her coma and visit Japan in search of O-Ren Ishii. There's a great scene involving Sonny Chiba and we eventually see The Bride hunt down O-Ren Ishii and her minions. The showdown is approximately an hour long and it's intense. Thurman looks like she can handle a sword and stunt double Zoe Bell handles the more difficult scenes.It's hard to think about the film without using the word perfect. The battle involves dozens of fighters as The Bride hacks her way through the obstacles standing between her and O-Ren Ishii. The contrast between those scenes and the final fight is stunning. Instead of being surrounded by a noisy mob, The Bride and O-Ren fight in a quiet setting. It's a very effective transition.I always watch Kill Bill Vol. 2 after seeing Vol. 1 and think of it as one long film. If you think that the characters feel incomplete, the concluding volume fleshes them out and makes them seem a lot more real. This first installment contains most of the action and fans of that genre should be happy with the result.Video Quality 5/5Kill Bill Vol. 1 looks fantastic on Blu-ray, even though it was released in 2008. Detail is strong throughout, whether the image is in color or black and white. Colors are rich and accurate and black levels won't disappoint. I detected slight aliasing in one scene, but the overall presentation makes the film one of the best-looking live action films yet released on Blu-ray.Audio Quality 5/5The lossless English: LPCM 5.1 mix matches the excellent video quality. There's a lot going on and it's all separated well and presented accurately. Whether it's the sound of swords clashing during the intense battle scenes, dialogue, feet crunching on cereal, or Daryl Hannah whistling the theme from Twisted Nerve, you'll hear everything clearly.Special Features 2/5The extras are all presented in standard definition:The Making of Kill Bill (22 minutes) - A decent feature with Tarantino and some of the cast and crew.The 5, 6, 7, 8s Musical Performances (6 minutes) - Two songs from the band featured in the film.Trailers - Six trailers for Tarantino's films.As I said at the start of this review, Kill Bill is so good that I'm close to tears within three minutes. It's full of action and thrills, good music, and some of the funniest dialogue I have ever heard. I find myself watching both parts more than anything else in my collection and love every moment each time I give it a spin. It's guaranteed to make me grin for four hours. If you like action and intelligent humor, I challenge you to name a better movie.Overall score 5/5	5.0	I watch the two Kill Bill movies more often than anything else	2011-04-25	4	4	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A359IT81FBX64Y	Steven Mason	Kill Bill is stylistic art, to be appreciated subjectively. Expect to be entertained, but also expect to be piqued. It has no real plot, but the story works anyway. I hate gratuitous violence, I refuse to watch slasher movies, and I don't enjoy true crime or martial art films. It's difficult to explain the appeal of this uncompromising, irredeemable revenge film, but I can say that it touched some primitive, atavistic part of my emotions (humans have a degree of bloodlust built into their genes, necessary for the survival of our ancestors, which, ironically, may be the undoing of us now), without making me feel dirty or used when I left the theater. Tarantino also doesn't throw in the usual bunch of moralistic, hypocritical baggage that comes with other violent movies. There's no vigilanteism, no heroism, no phony honor system, no blind loyalties, and innocent people are left alone. Anyway, Kill Bill is as fun as murder and mayhem gets.	5.0	Violence and revenge made slick and fun	2005-12-04	3	2	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AZHBX3PN7NVNU	"Steven M. Fish ""Steven M. Fish"""	First of all, Amazon's product feedback feature is not the place to praise or berate Sony or UMDs in general. Please stop bringing down the rating of this specific release just because you want to whine about the decisions Sony has made for distributing movies for the PSP. There are plenty of other forums for that. People are coming here to decide whether to purchase this title and couldn't care less about your opinions outside of that.After that rant, I'll keep this review short: The video quality is stunning. The soundtrack is clear and crisp (although stereo only). The valuable extras from the DVD are all here (only missing the trailers.. who cares?). This is a solid UMD release. If you can wait, certainly the price will drop, but if you can't $21 isn't unreasonable for what you get here, early adopter.In my opinion, this is the UMD movie to get today.	5.0	Excellent quality with all the expected extras!	2005-04-22	10	6	4
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AU3ECAEUNI0VV	Steven Russell Calava	Kill Bill is an exhilarating rollercoaster ride of visuals and sound, and in my opinion the finest of all Tarantino films. This striking tale of absolute revenge will not appeal to everyone, but it should. A smart, savvy script, great performances, unbelievable camera work, heart-pounding action scenes and a pulsating soundtrack puts this at the top of my must-see movie list. The DVD contains the wonderful DTS audio option and a fine &quot;making of&quot; featurette. Don't miss this one.	5.0	First rate action flick	2004-04-18	3	2	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A145B8OHVNNFAJ	Steward Willons	This is a wonderful, postmodern plundering of kung-fu, rape-revenge, and cult action movies. In Kill Bill, Tarantino deferentially revisits the 70s(ish) genre film with his typical style and wit. It's every bit as good as Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown.The major short-coming is the DVD itself. There is next to nothing in the way of extra features. This is inexcusable for a major studio release of a major studio film. The DVD includes a brief featurette that, as usual, spends most of its time showing clips from the movie. There are also some liner notes, but nothing amazing. It's a shame because there are some many places they could have gone with extras. I'd love to hear more about some of the specific references in the movie, I'd love to hear about the filming process during the black-and-white/color Crazy 88 sequence, I'd love to hear Tarantino talk about getting such an over the top violent picture through the ratings board. What would be better than anything would be a commentary track or two. Just look at Tarantino's buddy, Eli Roth. Cabin Fever wasn't a really great movie, but it includes no less than five commentary tracks(!) as does Hostel.Regardless, it's a great film and it's totally worth owning on DVD. I just wish there was something substantial in the extra features.	5.0	Classic Tarantino	2006-07-11	2	2	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2VKJKICHHOHNC	S. T. H. Thesingh	When I saw the trailer of this movie I had a feeling Kill Bill would not be a movie I would like. After seeing it my premonitions proved correct. Kill Bill has nothing to offer in comparison to a whole lot of other violent movies. Everything I liked about the previous films of Tarantino was missing. Intelligent plot and humor, very good acting, characters with depth, and I could go on, were all missing. The whole movie was a big clich&eacute;. Tarantino probably did that on purpose, but then still intentional boring clich&eacute;s are still boring. Not to say that KB is not well made in a technical sense. It's just not the special film that we all know Tarantino can make.	1.0	Very disappointing	2006-03-04	21	8	13

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A28OB7AV29AC1G	StonedRocker	Shockingly cruel scenes, extreme violence, and harsh language. Bravo! It's about time someone exposed the nature of humanity brooding beneath the thin skin of what we call civilization.A true, creative work of Art. Yeah, this film is all of these and a lot more. Tarantino reveals the violent nature of our age, the anger that we hide behind in the form of political correctness.pure geniusDon't go looking for the story??? ... sounds like someone might have missed the boat. Maybe they were looking for the Titannic instead of the eight-foot canoe next to the dock. Actually, there is a very ancient and simple storyline at work here, the same one that worked for the cheesy Hong-Kong kung-fu movies of the 70s. The same one that worked for a lot of old westerns, namely the quest for revenge, in this case, a mother's revenge. The story is simple and traditional, but like all great stories, that is not where the art lies. The art is in the satirizing of violence itself, the art dwells in the subjective abstract. The violence is extreme to the point of absurd, just like revenge is absurd, or is it? Perhaps it just is, whether we choose to embrace it or reject it, human beings are absurdly violent. Perhaps this is what Tarantino is trying to tell us.	5.0	A Master Piece	2006-02-14	2	2	0

If you are a fan of Tarantino movies then you will probably enjoy this one as well.  If you are not familiar with his work, then this may be the least offensive you might start with.  The gore is mostly phoney but still prevalent.  Ms. Thurman is an attractive young lady, no doubt.  But her attractiveness quickly disappears in the gratuitous mayhem and glorrification of blood revenge.  The fight scenes are pure martial arts fantasy of the cheesiest variety and are only props for additional blood-spurting ""entertainment.""

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1W3FS1C2H4RCV	stu	"This movie looks incredible.  The action sequences are top-notch.  There are lots of impressive stunts and swordfights captured with expert cinematography.  Kill Bill is absolutey dripping with style.  The problem is, this Tarantino picture comes across a lot more self-conscious than his previous films.  It's like when someone can't tell a joke because they're so caught up in how clever they are.  Also absent are his snappy dialogue and his usual command of non-linear storytelling.  This dialogue is often hokey and cloddish.  He does do the non-linear thing again, but this time it's lop-sided.  It doesn't flow as seamlessly as I expect a Tarantino script to flow.Now, the good stuff; did I mention that the film looks good?  ""Slick"" does not even begin to describe the look of this movie.  The last fight sequence in which Uma Thurman's character battles at least 100 men and women, is really a lot of fun.  If you are a fan of splatter movies or kung fu movies or especially splatter/kung fu movies, you will want to see this movie for this scene if nothing else.The four stars are for the eye-candy.  As far as characters or story, this is not Tarantino's best film.People talk about how derivitive this movie is, and rightly so.  No one ever mentions how much he has been influenced by Miike.  I hate to say it, but if you want to watch a real samurai flick with lots of arterial spray and humor and interesting characters, watch Dead or Alive or Ichi the Killer.  Then watch Kill Bill again with a fresh perspective."	4.0	Flashy.	2004-05-05	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AZBMTXXNPS6YD	"Subauthor ""jeffgonsalves dot com"""	"You don't understand! It's a tribute to 70's martial arts films!! It's a parody! It's a satire! It's an oxymoron (or maybe just moronic).These are the justifications that people use to defend ""Kill Bill""'s ingenuity. But what do these proclamations really mean?? Is a movie brilliant simply because it's a homage? Or is this an excuse people make to give a self-indulgent bloodbath from a slumming director a glowing review??Is this the best QT can do after a four year hiatus? A simple-minded revenge flick without complex characters, a lick of sense, or any realism whatsoever? It's like a Road Runner cartoon where Wile E. Coyote keeps getting his furry fanny kicked but keeps coming back for more. Only I liked Wile E. better than any of these one-dimensional goons. Heck, most twelve year-olds could write a more insightful or creative story than this one. And my apologies to any twelve year-olds who are insulted by this comparison...This is a film in which hundreds of assassins attack Uma Thurman simultaneously, and not one has the good sense to gun her down with an Uzi. It's the ultimate in style over substance. Frankly I found the Anime portion more emotional than the human story. All the characters are despicable. However, if your idea of an awesome movie is to see limbs severed, blood gouting up in crimson fountains, and sadism masqueraded as ultracool chic filmmaking, then dive right in and drown in an ocean of gore. Personally I prefer the soul and intensity of ""Jackie Brown"" over this piece of cinematic drivel. Like the mad cloning of Agent Smith in ""The Matrix"", martial arts action scenes keep getting duplicated yet more and more complicated until any sense of fun or drama is lost in the clever technology."	2.0	Blood?

I don't know why but this film feels slightly rushed.Bascially you have a woman, who was going to get married but got brutally battered and left for dead by a bunch of assains. Waking up after a 4 year coma she vows revenge. The music in this movie was good (classic stuff). the hanzo sword scenes weren't bad but not as good as part 2. You have a little comedy, a little sass, and a lot of attitude. I read a few reviews were people misread the animation scene (cause there is one and it surprised me cause you don't expect it in a film). Anyway some were saying it was porn. There was no sex, no talk of sex, and no sounds of it. So how can someone see it that way is a mystery. My only guess is those people didn't actually see the whole film (you know how some are, they see 2 seconds of a one hour film and want to give a review).	3.0	good...	2005-02-15	2	2	0

She was shot down by her former colleagues, an assassins' squad headed by David Carradine (Bill) on her wedding day, and while very pregnant. Four years later, she wakes up with a taste for vengeance.The cinematography is outstanding, the acting even better. The references to the old movies of this genre are just a treat.

However this was actually the first Tarantino film I sat through and believe me it will be the last.I was told that this was a great film with an interesting story and a unique use of music and fighting (I like watching women kick ass). The only thing unique about this movie (and like KB vol 2) was ""THE END"". I was waiting for the story to make sense, the plot to begin and the cheesy, corny and inane stuff to stop. For example: we are not allow to hear Uma Thurman's character's name until the second movie (he actually beeped out her name in the first one-WHY).Then there was the over usage of gore/blood/violence. Apparently Mr Tarantino has a fetish with blood (see all movies done by Tarantino). I don't think, in his career, he could make one movie without using blood.Now, Uma Thurman. She is indeed a beautiful woman. However, a martial artist she is not. She acted very plastic like and had movements like she was programmed to. As Lucy Liu said to her in the movie: ""White girl thinks she can fight like a samari"" (not verbatim-sorry).As I sat watching this gore infested, so called ""great film by many critics"", I was wondering ""Why the heck am I watching this?"" Apparently I was tricked into watching this. All I know is I would not have spent the $$$ to watch it in the theater. I, more than likely, would have walked out.The movie moved like a video game (like Gauntlet Dark Legacy). Each level has a ""sub boss"" before you can face the ultimate boss (in this case Bill and Lucy Liu, etc).As for the music, I was disgusted with the music. It had no reason/relivance to the story. I was sitting there when the music would blare on and think: ""Huh, ok. Why in this spot in the movie?"" The music was overbearing and over the top (as is Quentin).I am also wondering why so many critics praise him. Why do so many of them think he is a cinematic genius? The only thing I can think of is that he either bullies them into declaring his movies the greatest since Adam or he buys them off.Well for whatever reason, I am certainly not a fan of Kill Bill vol 1 or 2 nor am I a fan of Mr Tarantino."	1.0	IT'S A SHAME I CAN'T GO LOWER THAN 1 STAR	2005-03-11	32	9	23

Ten to fifteen dollars seems good for a no frills version of a movie you might already own on DVD. I also recommend DVD/UMD packages for new releases. I for one would not mind paying 29.99 for both the DVD and UMD version together in one package. This way its not like paying twice for the same film, instead you're saving money so that you don't have to buy the movie on UMD. Sony obviously didn't think this idea through because the Memory card can hold movies, as cumbersome as that process is, and sooner or later someone is going to come out with re-writable UMD's so that you can burn it on your comp and play it on the PSP.So let's review.1)Drop the price.2)Create DVD/UMD bundles3)Create re-writable UMD's.Wake up sony we already own these movies and we aren't itchin to double dip on versions of the film that don't come even come with features.

Having said that, and being a Tarantino fan, i find it impossible to forget that Tarantino himself has ""conditioned"" me (and most of his fans for that matter) to other standards. I've been conditioned to the stunning catalogue of Pulp Fiction and to the unmistakable ""indy feel"" of Reservoir Dogs. Tarantino's fans have learned to expect things.These ""expected things"" are in Kill Bill (for the most part) NOT delivered. Sure, Kill Bill has quite some things going for it. It has spectacular camera work and is overwhelming visually, it has the usual cult Tarantino characters, it has a very succesful retro touch, and when the action arrives on the screen it does so with a vengeance.Now, all this should do for a great flick, correct? Yes, it should, but sadly the negatives outweigh the positives. And the negatives are as overwhelming as the positives, this resulting and in a spectacularly unbalanced film.For starters there is practically NO dialogue. And, when there is dialogue, you wish there wasn't. Remember, this is a Tarantino film. You can have hordes of cult characters (and Kill Bill does) but if you dont put some appropriate dialogue in their mouths (and in KIll Bill there isnt any) all the ""cultness"" goes to waste, check that, the whole film might go to waste. The attempts at humor are lame at best and grand failures at worst. I'm focusing at humor because Kill Bill can NOT be taken seriously, therefore, anything any character utters in the film HAS to be funny. But it isnt. It comes out silly overall, and it spoils the positive credits of the film.Then, to move on, even if you're going to make an on purpose over the top film, you still have to maintain some coherence and logic in the plot, you know. Otherwise, why shouldnt i go and rent an original C-movie of that kind straight from the 70s? The reward would be much bigger because the originality would be there.A character wakes up from a coma and has atrophy in her feet but not in her hands??? Gimme a break. Then this same character, walks out from her room after murdering two people, and for 13 hours tries to get her limbs to work while (mysteriously) NOONE looks for her even though she's only in a car at the parkng lot of the hospital??? Gimme two breaks. The top of the head of another character gets chopped clean off and yet the brain is miraculously protruding off the top of the skull? Please.And so on and on, as there are plenty of such ""little"" plot mishaps.You could say that Quentin was counting on the rest of the film overwhelming the audience. It seems (if one looks at most reviews here) that Quentin is right.  You can have audiences loving in their majority a film and that said film still being mediocre though. The examples of this are countless.Tarantino doesnt reach past greatness with Kill Bill, certainly not with this Volume 1. It's no Pulp Fiction and no Reservoir dogs. More sadly though, one has the suspicion that Tarantino is trying to ride on his great past assuming that evereything everafter will be revered beyond belief automatically. Might be.Tarantino as a filmmaker is irresistible and this is a concrete fact. I will go to see Kill Bill Vol. 2 as well. You cant easily deny Quentin especially if you're a movie buff (or junkie) yourself.That's exactly the secret.But that cant force me to see ""greatness"" where there isn't any..."	3.0	"""Kill Bill"" kills itself...Sadly so..."	2003-10-27	7	3	4
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A17RFKCYS69M3Y	Tall Paul	This movie never lets up from the start. Very smart and original screenplay. There are a lot of homages to Asian films of past and current. You have to watch it several times to catch everything. Chiaki Kuriyama really stole the show as the character Go Go Yubari. She gave a very intense eerie performance. Even though she didn't get many lines the impact is tremendous. The only complaint is that the movie stopped so abruptly.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1ALSHTL8T6B9U	Taraellen	Here it is...the evolution of a creative genius.  Everything Tarantino has ever done has brought him to all new levels with this film.  Any Tarantino fan would understand this comment.  The characters are dynamic, the dialogue is incredible and the story is so original and unique.  His other films reveal mere glimpses of this tale, but now he finally reached the point when the ultimate story must be told.  Kill Bill Vol I sets the scene.  And the story continues, not in a Hollywood &quot;Part II&quot; way, but in a story that needs to be told in chapters.  Vol I sets the motif of a Japanese graphic novel come to life in every detail.  It's about legends, power, fear and survival.  All these elements brought together in one film makes it a timeless tale worth viewing many times over.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A8ZTPTLGC4755	Terry	WOW!!  That's all I can say when I first saw this film by Quentin Tarantino.  Uma Thurman is superb as the left-for-dead bride who comes back four years after being left in a coma to wreck vengeance on the cowards who tried to do her in.  David Carradine plays Bill, the clandestine leader of the Vipers, who seems to direct everyone's motives from the shadows.  This is definately Tarantino at his best and I highly recommend it.  It's not a film franchise for everyone; if anyone saw the interview he had with KRON's Jan Wahl a few years ago it just goes to prove that Tarantino makes films that he wants for his fans, not for those who love musical theater (not that there's anything wrong with that genre either).	4.0	Don't mess with the Bride!	2009-08-29	1	0	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A268EEWUXYCA8Q	Terry Mesnard	"Many have complained/slandered Quentin Tarantino for his use of heightened, over-the-top violence in Kill Bill Volume 1.  Those who would think twice would know that Tarantino was raised on the old martial arts movies from the 70s, etc.  In these movies, blood would fly in squirts of red water.  So, its no surprise to me that Tarantino would create his magnum opus as an homage to these early movies that gave him so much joy.As it is, Kill Bill Volume 1 is an exciting, very blood-filled revenge story.  It's also very different from Vol 2.  It sets up the Kill Bill universe, while introducing The Bride.  In fact, Vol 1 is a trial by fire for The Bride, effectively being a training ground for her where she will learn who she is and who here enemies are.  In fact, the first movie can be considered a ""coming of age"" story where the Bride finally comes into her own as an unstoppable brute.  She goes from having everything, to being in a coma, and then the movie shows her fight to get everything back (her coming into knowledge and power).Those who loved Pulp Fiction might not find the same dense storyline in this first volume.  The story here is basically for setting up the characters and giving you a hint of what's to come.  The second volume will answer questions and change what you think you know about the story, so just hold on through this one.This first movie, as stated earlier, is an homage to the old martial arts films but it is also an homage to Japanese cinema.  Not only do we have the very stylized violence of the martial arts films, but we have an amazing 10 minute anime sequence that is probably the most violent part of the movie.  We even have a master sword creator who will give The Bride her weapon of revenge.  The movie oozes with Japanese pop and cinema culture throughout the ages.I have never been a real fan of Uma Thurman but she excels in this movie.  You can tell this part was written for her and it amazes me that Tarantino is able to elicit such a terrifice performance from her where she has been merely adequate in other films by other directors.I was thoroughly entertained by this movie.  The cinematography was excellent, the music fit with the theme of the movie, it was crafted, you can tell, with love.  It is a powerhouse of a movie where those who aren't turned off by the stylized violence will find excellence.  And then there's Volume 2 (if interested check out my Review Part 2: Where we learn of Bill on the Kill Bill 2 page)..."	5.0	Review Part 1:  Where we learn of the Bride	2005-03-16	5	4	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2ZLQ0L1KU9VLO	"Terry R. Reynolds ""terr@mpinet.net"""	This movie is nothing but an orgy of violence. I cannot see this movie's appeal, unless you really like watching a relentless stream of hacked off limbs, blood gushing everwhere, pedophilliac rape, etc. The movie has very little plot. What truely amazes me is that I didn't turn it off earlier.For Parents: If you are one of those parents that use the rating system with some latitude, don't do it here. Keep your kids away from this one. This one is sick.I think the critics must be afraid of Tarantino or something. I cannot understand how they present their reviews of this flic. I suppose that in some way the movie was art, but the critics certainly should have at least qualified their praise. It really scares me that virtually every critic I read recommended this movie without qualification.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3P7ERFJUWNXVN	The Birdman	Japanese lore has a word for the people who  gave this film less than four stars: idiot. i mean, what were you thinking? firstly, its not a bad influence to kids because blood just doesn't flow like that. its not ripping off Japanese culture or anything like that, it's paying homage to the grindhouse(of which Japan was a major supplier to). the very movies that inspired Tarantino to make the likes of Resevoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction which these same people either haven't seen or hated because they are idiots. i say that again, BECAUSE THEY ARE IDIOTSThis film is not original, it is an eclectic blend of classic movie styles which, because it features neither CG nor explosions nor the most convoluted type of love story tripe, grates horribly for anyone without a 1970s to 1980s sensibility. or, for that matter, an open mind.The Kudos are as follows: Uma Thurman is brilliant and more violent than Arnie as The Bride. David Carradine, in just a few of his scenes, makes a villainous presence quicker than any villain currently in cinema(why isn't he in more movies?) Yuen Woo-Ping, who out does his impressive work on the Matrix movies, and Tarantino himself for bumping the grind(house).The insults are as follows: anyone who deemed this movie too violent, too boring, too unlike Pulp Fiction, too harmful to Llamas, Ferrets or indeed any vertebrate animal, and anyone who has said a bad word about this movie. they can go watch Forrest Gump for all i care, all i want are three things:A Samurai Sword, A Yellow Tracksuit, and Volume 2!!!	5.0	Uma Thurman is never a straight line	2004-04-20	1	0	1

The music and sound effects alone make the movie wonderful...but it is the cartoon-like excessive violence that makes it what it is.  The fights are brutal, but in a REALLY fun way...this is where his brilliant music and sound effects choices make the film.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ	the-gr8shag	"- Revenge is a dish best served cold. -  Old Klingon Proverb""Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids."" - O-ren Ishii and ""The Bride"" exchange a pop cultural reference (and a hint to ""The Bride's"" real name) before squaring off in ""Kill Bill"".Even before I saw this film back on 10/11/03, I had a strong feeling I was going to be owning ""Kill Bill"" on DVD, and I was right (I purchased it on 4/14/04!).One of the best films of 2003, Quentin Taratino's 4th film is, perhaps, one of, if not, his best film to date. Not as ""quirky"" as ""Pulp Fiction"" (still a great film though), ""Kill Bill"" is a justly violent revenge film that pays tribute to the chop-socky, grindhouse, exploitation films that graced drive-ins, and rundown theaters of the 1970's.A female assassin known as ""The Bride"" is setup on her wedding day, with her former employer ""Bill"" and his gang known as ""The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad"", killing her, and her friends on her supposed wedding day. ""The Bride"" miracously surivives and spends the next four years in a coma. She awakens to find her baby gone (she was pregnant at the time of the massacre), a hole in the left side of her head, (a permanent reminder courtesy of Bill) and a cold, blood chilling need for revenge. She does get her revenge, dispatching, former fellow employees, Vernita Green, and O-ren Ishii with her gang, ""The Crazy 88's"" led by Johnny Mo & Go-Go Yubari, with a vengeful wrath that would make Khan blush.This movie easily has ""cult film"" written all over it. The action is almost non-stop (the last 45 minutes alone is worth the 5 star rating). Tarantino is at the top of his game. His direction in this film is tight (the film moves from color, to black and white, to silhouette in the fight at The House of Blue Leaves with ease, the viewer is thankful for it, without being to jarring). The performances are great (the cast members who were a part of the ""DiVA"" squad went through some martial arts training for the film). If you've seen ""Kill Bill Volume 2"", watch this film again and you might see some subtle hints to the second film (the reference to ""Trix"" cereal hints at ""The Bride's"" real name, an eye pull during the final battle hints at Elle Driver's fate in ""2"" and notice in this film that when ""The Bride"" walks through the airport to get to The House of Blue Leaves check out the billboard in the background advertising Red Apple cigarettes. Does the woman look familiar? It should. Its Julie Dreyfus who plays Sofie Fatale). ""The Bride"", unfortunatly, doesn't kill Bill in this opening installment, but, there is always ""Kill Bill Volume 2"". Die-hard fans of the genre will not be dissapointed.As for the DVD, its a must own, but don't expect a lot of special features (a 20 min. making of segment, 2 music videos by the ""5,6,7,8's"", with trailers from other Tarantino films as well as trailers for ""Kill Bill: Volumes 1 & 2""). Hopefully, with the release of ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"", Tarantino will release an ultimate ""Kill Bill"" edition in the near future."	5.0	"Killer ""Bill"""	2004-04-16	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	The Groove	There's a good chance that you already know the story behind &quot;Kill Bill,&quot; the first Quentin Tarantino movie in 6 years.  It was originally going to be released as a 3-plus hour epic, but the boys at Miramax studios made the dubious decision to cut the film in half.  Even so, &quot;Volume 1&quot; is good enough to stand on its own.  Uma Thurman is on fire as the Bride, who goes on a mission to get revenge against the five members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (the &quot;DiVAS&quot;) who gunned her down for dead on her wedding day four years ago.  Like 1994's &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; the events in this film are told out of sequence, leaving the viewer to piece together the chain of events in order.  And as action movies go, &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is a virtual bloodbath, a martial arts film with enough gore to make &quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&quot; look like a Disney picture.  If the sight of decapitations and the removal of limbs repel you in any way, you are best advised to steer clear from this movie.  (There's also an extended anime clip that shows the history of the assassin O Ren Ishii that's equally graphic and disturbing)  At times, &quot;Kill Bill&quot; goes into overkill and gets a bit too flashy for its own good.  You can almost visualize Tarantino exclaiming &quot;look Ma, no hands!&quot; as he relentlessly brings on the action to cartoonish extremes.  Say what you will about this movie, but one thing is certain: you won't be bored.  &quot;Kill Bill&quot; also closes with an effective cliffhanger that leaves you salivating.  The second &quot;volume&quot; is slated for release in early 2004.  I'll be in line for tickets.	4.0	The Bride and The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.	2003-11-03	44	32	12

His other movies are great too, but this and Pulp Fiction are definately his best.  Does he have anything else up his sleeve?  I don't know...I don't even know why I would ask myself that question.This movie centers around a woman who is seeking revenge on those who killed her baby and shot her in the head.  Four years and one coma later, she awakes to a shabby trucker who wants to do the old in-out with her.  She escapes that hospital in trademark Quentin gore and chases down those who have wronged her.  The rest is pretty much her getting a sword and shoving it through people.

Everyone loves this guy for basically no reason...He made Pulp Fiction, great, but that movie blows.  I mean seriously, it was a mesh of inconsequential garbage losely tied together and littered with sophomoric dialogue that certainly worked to fool a lot of viewers into thinking it was somewhat significant.  To top it all off, they add swearing and gore, so people won't be scared to think it's 'cool'.  The whole movie blows.Anyway, Kill Bill is stupid.  Who wants to see an ugly banana jump around pretending she doesn't suck at martial arts.  Honestly, could the martial arts suck any more?

I find myself eating my words after seeing &quot;Kill Bill.&quot; I had never really known that a film could have a plot like this, be so stylish, and have just about everything else as well, all fit into two hours. The fight scenes (albeit bloody) are amazingly entertaining, and the characters are enjoyable. Some of the dialogue is a bit dry (&quot;Silly rabbit, trix are for kids) but they do fit the scene. It has comic relief in there right when it is needed. Uma Thurman gives a wonderful leading lady performance as she takes out her various former associates who attempted to kill her, ultimately leading up to the point where she will kill Bill, the head of the organization, known as DIVAS (Deadly Viper Assasination Squad.)

I like the fact that this movie is a bit (note: bit) different than any movie I've seen so far.  Of course he's taken lots of different things from other film genres but what film doesn't nowadays?  Practially every film has nearly been done and done to death, can't fault QT for that.  I loved the Anime part for Cottonmouth's story.  The first fight scene with Copperhead was brutal and I loved it, it was wild and unfilm like which added a level of realism.Now for the bad (or near bad)After the kitchen knife fight I was expecting something along those lines throughout the film.  Meaning, the realism of that fight scene made me believe that most of the fight scenes would have that same level of realism to it.  But as the movie went along the scenes just got more and more cartoonish.  Like the blood shooting out of every chopped off limb. Maybe it was something QT was aiming for and therefore was done on purpose but it just didn't do much for me.  It brought me out of the ""realism"" of the brutality in the movie (which IMO would have been better) and brought it to a out of this world fantasy.  Once again something QT may have been aiming for but did nothing for me.  Now don't get me wrong, I still loved the fighting in the movie, I even loved The bride fighting Cottonmouth's 17 year old guard.  But still there was something off about this movie.  Uma Thurman was off for me.  When she stabbed a guy and lifted him up in the air I couldn't help but roll my eyes at that scene.  IMO I think ""The Bride"" should have been a more bada$$ hard as nails type woman, Uma looks like a mouse to me.  The only scene she was remotely believable as ""The Bride"" was the Kitchen knife fight.  There I was like ""Ok, this woman is ready to kill this b*tch""  But then as it all went practially in cartoon mode I was like ""Ok, This woman is ready to be a super hero""  Which seems to be what QT was aiming for since in the previews for ""Kill Bill 2"" it says something about her becoming a hero.  But still Uma was all wrong for this part, it was hard to buy her as a bada$$ killing machine.  IMO, she just didn't belong.  I guess I have to see this whole movie as a live action anime film which it basically seems to be the route it took.  As for the violence, I can't see how anyone could even take it seriously enough to get offended by it, it was like something out of a cartoon instead of something real.  Also how come none of the crazy 88 carried guns?! I'm quite sure it would have been really hard for Cottonmouth to become Queen of the Tokyo underworld with the  mediocre sword using crazy 88 as her backup, the other Yakuza clans would have just pulled out their guns and blew them all away, but apparently no one uses guns in Japan.  Uma battling over 40 or 50 guys with swords? Give me a break (but I still liked it.)  Also the 'Viper death Squad' and 'the Bride' should be featured on ""worlds dumbest assassins"", e.g. She (bride) accepts coffee from a women she tried kill two mins earlier and actually drinks it, Copperhead is too dumb to even poison the freaking cup.  'California Mountian Snake' is too dumb to just push the top of the needle down to inject the poison before answering the phone, Bill is too dumb to just let ""CMS"" kill her, Cottonmouth is too dumb to hire compentant men who carry guns.But still, overall I still enjoyed the film, I liked the music, liked the story (good old fashioned revenge!) and I enjoyed the characters all but Uma, actually one reviewer was right when they said the only interesting characters are the ones 'The Bride' is killing off.  Also I can't really feel for Uma's character, I mean, I understand why she would want revenge, the beginning was brutal, but still I can't really feel for her plight.  So I'll give it a 3 to maybe 3 1/2 stars."	4.0	Pretty Good movie	2004-04-15	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A15LP6QH9UXJTA	Thomas C. Banks	What was Tarantino thinking? He stuffs all his favorite genres into a single movie mixing visuals, music, and styles from scene to scene. A washed out scene like a spaghetti western including the ripped off soundtrack. A campy chopsuey bloody fight scene. A stylish martial arts scene. Japanese anime - yes, Tarantino tosses in animation scenes. Film noir. A dash of campy Charlie's Angels. I'm sure I'm missing some. Add in a near record number of annoying flashbacks and you have a confused film one assumes is meant to be, at some level, satire but lacks any real humor, cleverness, or bite. Terribly sadistic in places, it generally is lacking in humanity. Uma Thurman is completely wasted though she tries awfully hard to breath life into an empty script. Oh, did I mention his fascination with spraying blood that gushes from wounds like an uncapped fire hydrant? Excessive is what this film's all about.

How else do you explain the overbearing pop culture jokes all over this overlong, over-bloody cheeseball of a revenge flick? Lots of them are just stupid (the ""Ironsides"" theme) and then one of occasional brilliance (like the cereal box of Ka-Boom) to make up for it, but most are just of the overbearing clever-clever variety. And gory. REALLY gory. I mean, really really REALLY gory. Was this some kind of attempt to make up for the past 5 years of bloodless mega-fights (see ""Matrix Reloaded"")? The fight in the Tea Leaves room is nothing but severed body parts and so much blood that you imagine firehoses pumping the goo from just out of camera range as Quentin giggles with glee...""yeah, that'll make 'em squirm!

Hee hee hee!""Well, aside from the opening setting of The Bride in black and white and the anime sequence, there was little here to suggest that Tarantino was once being heralded as genius. In fact, aside from The Bride tracking down her ""kill list,"" there ain't much of a plot or development of character. Uma Thurman is stunning as the bride, however.

""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is a tribute to old kung fu, samurai and revenge flicks. People may argue that it's a huge ripoff, but it's totally fresh. The Bride (Uma Thurman) was a part of the DiVAS, a group of mercenaries, but quit for an unknown reason. Bill (David Carradine) was the leader and he ordered his gang to off the Bride. But, they didn't exactly do a good job and she ended up recovering from her coma. She traveled to Tokyo and summoned a retired Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba) to construct the perfect samurai sword. Green Hornet music remembrance! Bruce Lee's yellow track suit is the bomb! Then in the House of Blue Leaves, she took care of everyone. A red rain had been poured all over the place! She even nailed the schoolgirl, literally! The ultimate showdown between O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and the Bride was a work of literature! Gracefulness has never looked so good in combat! ""Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"" is one of the best songs in music history! Mammoth achievement by Quentin Tarantino. Even the cliffhanger ending made quiver in my seat! Wholly!

When Uma Thurman starts making the film sound like a  feminist spectacle, and I don't know the name of the black actress starts doing the same, well, that's akin to anti-porn activists calling ""The Lion King"" ""subtle pornography.""

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A8GC79UDFIN6E	toddowen	The best part of this movie is the feeling of relief once you've removed yourself from its sight and sound. If only it could be completely forgotten as well.It's not even the violence or the gore that causes me to dislike this movie, because I've never let that get in the way of a good movie.But to put it simply, this is NOT a good movie. It doesn't even make it as a camp/cult classic.I think it mainly suffers from a poorly written and predictable script. It's embarrassing at times, and the shame is compounded by the knowledge that there is an audience out there that approves of this film. But then again, there's an audience for the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as well. In fact, this movie could be seen as sort of a graduation from the tantrum throwing Ritalin years of adolescence into the unpredictable rebellious spray paint huffing juvi-delinquent stage.Save yourself the time and strive for better.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AV5G37VFE5NVD	Tom Benton	"Finally, after six long years, writer/director extraodinare Quentin Tarantino is back with the much anticipated KILL BILL: VOL. 1, the first in a two-part film series that was first visualized by Tarantino back in 1994, during the filming of PULP FICTION.Uma Thurman plays a character only known as ""The Bride"" (her real name is bleeped out throughout the film, just to agrivate us).  On her wedding day, the pregnant Bride is attacked by Bill (David Carradine) and his band of assassins.  Beat brutally and shot in the head, The Bride is left for dead by Bill.  Four years later, she reawakens from a coma to find herself the source of sexual abuse.  After beating up her doctor viciously, The Bride steals his ""... Wagon"" and takes off on a quest for revenge on Bill.Tarantino loves to do films that start off in the middle, then go back to the beginning, and then go to the end.  KILL BILL is no expection, as it begins with The Bride stopping at her second victim's house.  The victim, played by Vivica A. Green, is no match for The Bride, who soon murders Green...right in front of her daughter.  Following that, we learn how The Bride killed her first victim, O-Ren Ishi, fittingly played by Lucy Liu.KILL BILL is a new direction for Tarantino.  He gives us your typically violent and brutal Tarantino action flick, and yet this time, he combines the violence with black comedy send-ups and references to old martial arts films.  One such reference is the O-Ren Ishi murder scene, in which Thurman is dressed in a yellow suit identical to the one worn by Bruce Lee in his final film, GAME OF DEATH.  Sonny Chiba, the legendary star of THE STREET FIGHTER films, also stars as the retired sword-maker who teaches Thurman the way of the samurai.The directing is excellent.  It's just as good as when Tarantino began in 1992 with RESERVOIR DOGS.  The script is fun and immensely entertaining, and surprisingly, it works much better in two films than in one.  There's another Tarantino trademark as well, the awesome soundtrack.  It's not as good as PULP FICTION's soundtrack, but it's pretty cool as it is.  Language-wise, KILL BILL is rather tame, with only about ten uses of the F-word, unlike Tarantino's other films.  Violence-wise, it's one of the most violent films I've ever seen, and definitely the most violence (over 450 gallons of fake blood were used).  There's also a neat little ten-minute anime sequence, which I'm sure brought the film very close to an NC-17 rating.Purposefully cheesy and immensely entertaining, KILL BILL is one of my favorite Tarantino's yet.  Thurman is terrific; there's no question of acting here.  There's also some nice editing, especially around the attempted hospital murder scene (featuring the theme from 1968's ""Twisted Nerve"").  Tarantino fans won't be disappointed; in fact, I highly doubt anyone will be disappointed.  KILL BILL is nowhere near Tarantino's best, but it's one of the most original films I can remember seeing.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AP5MAXBH03H4T	tom	I have not been a big fan of Quentin Tarantino's films to be honest.  They have been energetic, sexy, brilliantly shot and entertaining but I never involved myself fully into his films.But Kill Bill is extraordinary entertainment from Tarantino.  It's a pure revenge film about a woman, named the Bride (Uma Thurman) who sets out to kill those who tried to murder her and murdered her unborn child on her wedding day.There are exciting sequences throughout, and while the film is extremely violent, it is also cartoonish violence and the visuals are eye-popping and dazzling.  Uma Thurman makes a great heroine, and I disagree with a previous review that said that Thurman does not make her character sympathetic.  I think the audience will root for her to get her revenge, yet there are moments in the film where you realize the kind of life she is living (and has led in the past) and there are moments of vulnerability displayed by Thurman's character.The soundtrack is also fantastic and I highly recommend this no-holds barred entertaining flick.	5.0	My favourite film of the year so far	2003-10-10	1	0	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AST3QGXUEX31Z	Tom	I call this: Quentin's masterpiece.  I thought this movie was better than The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.  I watched this movie in theatres and thought it was one of the greatest movies in movie history (next to Spider-Man 2).  This movie is pretty much: BLOODY FUN.  I'm going to warn you that this is an ultra-violent tale of revenge but if you get through it, you'll love it.  If you hate violent movies, you'll still like it.  I guarntee you'll love this movie and treat it like gold when you get a copy of the DVD or VHS.  I saw this movie about over 15 or 20 times and I still love it.  I thought it was the best Quentin Tarantino movie so far.  The first time you see it, I know you'll be kind of shocked by how much blood they put in there, but if you watch it more, you'll appreciate the story more and why she's killing all those people.  I don't want to spoil it for you but she has a choice and it's kill or be killed and she chose kill.  It's shocking what horrible things they did to this woman and she wants to fight back and get revenge.  If you haven't seen it yet, listen to me: GO NOW AND RENT IT OR BUY IT AND SEE IT and I know you'll love it.P.S.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ALN0TTRTLHA4E	"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick"""	What purports to be a  highly trained assassin is left in a comatose state in a hospital for four years after her husband and her friends are killed violently in front of her. She decides to take revenge by killing all those involved in her husbands and friends death. Up to this point things are reasonably rational. We only know her name as the bride and she is played by Uma Thurman.One of the main participants in her death, and thus a target for revenge, is a woman called Cotton Mouth who runs the Japanese criminal underworld.  Uma decides that to kill Cotton Mouth she will need a special weapon which is, a sword. Now I thought that Lord Kitchener at the battle of Ombaduran (1898) had demonstrated that bladed weapons came in a rather distant second to modern fire arms. Kitcheners army lost one soldier to a mild stomach upset whilst his machine guns killed 20,000 Sudanese in a little over an hour. Not only are swords very much the weapon of yesterday they are just so bulky. If you wander down the street you can see them and they rather telescope what is about to go down. However in a film like this we are not in the real world. What we are doing is to try to create a legend and in legends you had swords. King Arthur had one that he drew from a stone. The King of Vietnam had one given to him by a sacred turtle. The legend is of course one that comes from countless Hong Kong flicks which this is really either a tribute to or derivative off.Uma, sword on her back riding on a motor bike, is able to head to a restaurant in which the hated Cotton Mouth is having lunch with her eight (8) body guards. Oddly enough the restaurant sees no real problem with eight people entering their premises wearing black masks equipped with swords.  Perhaps it is just how things are in Japan. Uma who is meant to be a trained assassin could of course used a sniper rifle, placed a bomb in the restaurant or poisoned the food. She however cuts the arm off Cotton Mouth's secretary and challenges the rest to a fight. One would have thought that one possible problem with this strategy was that her proposed victim could simply wander off out the back door during the excitement. Not to mention the fact that Uma could be killed by the overwhelming numbers or be caught by the police. These are not real considerations for her and she is then involved in a frantic fight with Cotton Mouth's poorly coordinated body guards. Cotton Mouth also seems to have hired her protectors from idiots are us. None of them have fire arms or are able to work in a rational or systematic way.One would have thought that in a well regulated country such as Japan a fight involving eight people with samurai swords might be the sort of thing which would attract police attention. In fact the death of eight people in such circumstances would be one of the more significant events in any large modern city. Not only do the fleeing restaurant patrons not call the police but another forty or so people wearing masks and carrying samurai swords turn up as reinforcements. Again one would think that this is the sort of thing which lead to at least one police car wandering by to see what was happening.Of course however the epic fight goes on and then there is the final confrontation between Uma and Cotton Mouth. In real life Cotton Mouth would possibly simply slip out the back of the restaurant and wander down to a gun shop to by an Uzi. However she stays around to be involved in one of those climatic type duel things.And of course the reason for this is that in all those Hong Kong films you always had sword or Kung Foo fights. But of course films like the Shaolin Monastery were set in a time before the use of gunpowder.In an earlier scene Uma kills another woman responsible for the attack which left her in hospital. She turns up to the woman's house and has a knife fight. Now this is a dumb way for an assassin to act. If you leave blood at a scene nowdays the police pick up samples and if you get away it is still enough evidence to arrest you later. That is why people who do actual contract killings use firearms and try not to leave much to indicate who did it such as traces of their blood or body tissue. But again this film is a tribute to the Kung Fu genre in which the revenge motive is played out by a series of personal confrontations.Despite the fact that the high number of absurdities makes it difficult for one to watch the film without annoyance it sort of works. Uma looks great and yellow motor bike outfits will probably be the all the go for a while. The dialogue is one of Tarantino's strong points what there is, is central to the creation of the mood of the film.	2.0	Sort of allright	2004-04-14	12	2	10
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1F74MIBVETBPT	tommy	In my honest opinion, this movie surpasses The Matrix by a long shot. This movie was made so well, and Tarantino added this awesome style to the movie, it's simply stunning. It has just about everything, humour, martial arts, great dialogue, very very very fake blood thats spurts out in fountains, and an awesome supporting cast of unforgettable characters.Four years after the massacre at her wedding, the Bride awakes from her coma and seeks revenge on the 5 people who did this to her.The cast is played very well by everyone. Uma Thurman truly shines, and the supporting cast is also very good: Budd (Michael Madsen), Oren-Ishii (Lucy Liu), Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and of course, you can't forget the big man himself, Bill played by David Carradine (voice). Other well done roles include the girl who plays GoGo Yubari and Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba?)Every role in the film is very well done.If you don't mind A LOT of blood and lots of violence, this moviemust be seen.

Let's see, we were 4 years ago, 4 years later, two days past 4 years later and tomorrow 6 months ago. HUH? And don't forget the all important subtitles and animation he added to make sure you &quot;got it&quot;. I think at the very least he could have spent a little extra money on the English translation of the English dialogue because otherwise I can not tell what the H--- is going on!I finally &quot;got&quot; Pulp Fiction after the 12th viewing. I even managed to keep up with &quot;Resevoir Dogs&quot; even tho there were no subtitles and no Englsh to English translation. The actors even had characters to match their given nicknames! I loved that movie and have probably seen it ten times! BUT..........I guess it's me, apparently this is a Testosterone flick and since I don't have that particular hormone this movie could not get past my brain sensors.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A38QJ7JUUTVLKX	"Tom Servo ""Robot"""	Okay the previews looked very dumb, but believe me this ended up pretty decent. Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill, Vol. 1 is trash for connoisseurs of violence, gore, and stupid senseless fighting. That be me. Yes the plot and story are direivative, but since he injecting his own oft-copied, never-duplicated style into what is, quite simply, a revenge flick, beginning with the near-murder of the Bride, pregnant on her wedding day and left for dead by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad including Lucy Liu and the unseen David Carradine who become targets for the Bride's lethal vengeance. Culminating in an ultraviolent, ultra-stylized tour-de-force showdown, that will please gore hounds and action/kung-fu buffs. It's just a fun movie. Haven't had this much fun since Pirates of the Carribean.	5.0	Not as dumb as it looks. Very Satisfied	2003-10-28	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ABMM93A1VJ4UO	Tom Timmermans	You'll notice 99% of votes here are either 1 star or 5 stars. There really isn't any &quot;in between&quot; or halfheartedness possible here. After all, it's a Tarantino movie. I find his movies usually have that &quot;love it or hate it&quot; effect.I was in total awe after seeing this movie. Probably the best movie since 1998's The Big Lebowski.The storyline is dead simple... But Tarantino manages to inject so many style-elements into the movie that it keeps you at the edge of your seat. 70s Hong Kong kunfu flicks, Japanese manga, graphic displays of violence, wry humor of the blackest kind and a soundtrack that at times seems so inappropriate it becomes appropriate. As usual for Mr T: blood flows like water down a mountain stream and the characters are quirky, but somehow likeable.And still it's unlike Quentin's last couple of movies. It's more like Tarantino to the tenth degree.Vol. 2 just came out in the theaters here and I can't wait to see it. See how this bloodbath of vengeance continues.Definitely not for everybody, but those who can see through the violence and gore, will find what a true cinematic gem this movie is.Good to see Mr T hasn't lost any of his genius.So in short...If you hate Tarantino's other movies, please steer clear of this one. If you love his other flicks, run (don't walk) and get this DVD today!Period.	5.0	1 star or 5 stars: which category are you?	2004-04-21	4	2	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3S7REHVBOSTLR	Toni V. Sweeney	The credits say this was Quentin Tarantino's 4th film. I say it always should be considered one of his best. A mixture of live-action and anime, it's bloody and violent in the true anime sense but still manages to inject that it's-a-story-and-not-real-but-entertainment aura. Blood in extravagant amounts but somehow it still seems unreal rather than gory.There are performances by actors not usually known for this kind of film and everyone is excellent. The story is one of revenge but the way it's orchestrated, directed, and acted out has to be seen rather than described.  Well-known names in some interesting roles. Look for Samuel L. Jackson hiding under a well-concealing hat brim. Uma Thurman delivers a tour-de-force since she's in every scene. Why there weren't more award given out for this movie is a mystery.This movie was rented by the reviewer and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.	5.0	Action, Anime...what more can you want?	2014-06-08	0	0	0

I didn't see it at the theatres because of all the negative hype on the &quot;glorified violence&quot;. After seeing this film, I can say that it is violent, yes, but without the gore. If you want real gore, go see something like Silence of the Lambs, or better yet, The Passion of the Christ. The violence here is on the level of comic books, and in the tradition of the old samurai films (the 'baby and carriage' series comes to mind). It is a pure delight to see how the film is woven together masterfully, any film student will find it intellectually and artistically stimulating.	5.0	Brilliant movie making	2004-04-19	6	4	2

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2ND03M2J2W8CB	Tony@TonyTalksTech.com	"Okay, most of you have already heard something about Kill Bill. If you were listening to some professional critic, then you got their take on the movie...negative. If you heard from a friend or kung fu enthusiast, then you heard that this movie really rocks. Of course, I take the side of the kung fu enthusiast. The movie is good on so many levels.Quentin Tarantino labels this movie as a dark comedy; it definitely is. With all of the lose of limps and blood, there was a lot of comedy mixed in and I don't think that you have to be specially attuned to realize it. When Uma Thurman goes to fight Lucy Liu, she wears a yellow sweat suit with a black stripe, just like Bruce Lee did in the Game of Death. Before Uma can fight Lucy Liu, she has to get through all of her henchmen. Part of the henchmen are the infamous 88. If you watch kung fu movies you'll know that the hero has to  kick butt on a 100 bad guys before he can get to the well rested super villain. Lucy Liu even had the nerve to ask if Uma had saved her strength for their fight. That was funny!...Well, maybe you had to be there.If you watch this flick pay attention to the airplane's &lt;Acronym title=""Samurai Long sword"">Katana&lt;/Acronym> holders. Attention is not drawn to this sight in the movie, you would just have to notice it. It is funny to see, for if it was a plane in reality, you wouldn't be allowed in the airport with such a sword, let alone allowed to board the plane with it.There are a lot of great ideals to see in this movie. The modern day Samurai is portrayed, for anyone that wishes to carry a sword with them, does. Women are great warriors. All of the fights that mattered are girl on girl. The sword play and knife play are superb. Hat tip to Uma, Lucy, Vivica, and Chiaki. I really liked watching Chiaki play her part; you have to see it.The kung fu influences that inspired Quentin are prevalent throughout the movie. Bruce Lee's Game of Death with Uma's outfit, Shogun Assassin with Uma's ability to severe limb from body with great ease, Master of the Flying Guillotine with Chiaki's deadly ball and chain. Homage is indeed paid to these classic films. There are other influences, the more kung fu you watch, the more things will reveal themselves to you.Filmography will hold your attention as well. Black & White was used to emphasis some of the crucial events of the story. One spot I didn't like the use of Black & White shooting and it was in the fight scene with the 88. Anime was used to ease the audience into the upcoming blood and guts. I didn't see any guts, just a lot of blood and severed limbs. Part of the fight scene with the 88 was done as a silhouette scene against a blue backdrop. I thought that was really cool, a great effect. The story and writing was great, even for a revenge story. Excellent fight scenes, sword play, top notch. There was even an air of Charlies Angel's thrown in the mix...Bill's face was never shown (I think!). Uma also doesn't have a name in the movie, she is known as ""The Bride"". This pays homage to a classic as well. So much to catch in the first sitting, I need to watch it again. DVD is on my must have list. The movie gets a 4.75 stars from me. Go see it!"	5.0	Quentin is back!	2003-10-12	11	6	5
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A10E6UXWQFKD5M	Topper In Missouri	I saw this film when it was in theaters.  I don't understand why so many people think this film is so great.  It reminds me a geat deal of an older movie &quot;Falling Down&quot;, but with an angry white woman as the lead instead of an angry white male.  Being a non-white in this movie is a death sentence.  Umma Thurman's character makes it a point to kill or mame just about every non-white in her path.  I walked away from this movie wondering if Tarrintino doesn't have some serious issues with the non-whites of the world.	1.0	I don't understand why this movie gets such good reviews	2004-04-14	29	4	25
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A8U8JSMH2IA2T	Torik	Kill Bill is by far the best action movie of all time. The plot is a bride (Uma Thurman) is shot in the head at her wedding in a small chapel in El Paso, Texas. The bride was pregnant at the time. She wakes up from a four year coma and wants revenge. She has a kill list and has 5 people on it the last being Bill. This movie is great and i can not wait to see the sequel. I praise this movie and recommend it very highly. Not only does Uma Thurman have a great performance but so does Lucy Liu who plays the leader of a underworld gang from Tokyo. Although this movie is excellent it is very gory and sometimes disgusting so close your eyes when they happen (especially the Buck part). I promise If you watch this youll want to see the next one.

Uma Thurman slices and dices her way through tons of bad guys with her trusty Japanese sword, deftly defying gravity to her advantage. At times, this seems like ""Crouching Tiger"" for the MTV generation. The violence is so over the top that it really is funny, especially when limbs and heads get severed and there's geyers of blood spurting forth.Part of the film is animie that explains the origin of the Lucy Liu character. It is highly stylized in its own right and commands your complete attention.Some of the non-action scenes are too long and drawn out, which is this film's biggest flaw.If you're looking for complex plot and thought-provoking dialogue, look elsewhere. If you're looking for mindless action, this is about as stylized and as funny as it gets. Blows away films that take themself too seriously, like the Blade series.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	Even though I am a huge movie buff, I am not a Quentin Tarantino fan. I didn't enjoy any of his previous three films and thought they were basically overhyped garbage. Therefore, I was reluctant to see KILL BILL VOLUME I. When I saw the previews, I thought to myself, &#34;Give me a break.&#34; However, after a close friend recommended the film to me, I finally gave in and was quite surprised with what I saw.KILL BILL doesn't seem to contain one original piece of filmmaking. Just about everything in the movie is stolen from some obscure film or television show of the past: from the opening credits to Uma Thurman's yellow jumpsuit. However, all the pop references of the past are chopped up and brought together in such an unique way that a totally new film is born. Even more surprisingly than that is the film actually works, even with all the cheesy gore, great sword fights, and witty-yet-over-the-top dialogue. Outside of the characteristic heavy foul language, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I left the theatre thinking to myself, &#34;Ah, man, now I have to four months to find out what happened.&#34; In that sense, the movie resembles another great tribute of the pop cultural past: the surprise cliffhanger.

I am in luck that I can see the ""more violent"" version in Hong Kong (where the Crazy 88 Fighting scene is in color).  First, I appreciate Mr. T's admiration to HK movies, especially the Kung Fu oldies.  Much of the fighting scenes - though handled by Yuen Wo Ping - are different from the wired scenes like those in Charlie's Angel or Matrix.  I would like to say that, believe it or not, the body cutting action is very very common in the 70's in HK's martial arts movie.  In one famous movie, the hero even carried his intestine hanging outside his torn abdomen.  Ridiculous?  No.  On TV screen, we once saw a sword fighter to cut half vertically an enemy.  Violent?  You've only seen little in Kill Bill.Also, the storyline is quite a common revenge story in Chinese martial art story.  So common that what this story still shines is Mr. T's superb story telling ability.  I am sure that no other director can present such a standard story in such a stylish way.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AXDD8KIQF5GGX	Ty Jones	Let me start off by saying that this is an excellent idea. Who really wants to play $250-$400 on a portable DVD player? Not me, i am not made of money. i would rather carry around a portable gaming device/mp3 player/movie player/picture viewer for $250+ than spend more on a DVD player alone. The one thing that i do think is an annoyance would have to be the price. Some people probably have these DVD's and would probably not want to buy them again just to see them on their PSP. I am in this position becuase i am an avid DVD collector. I do agree with the previous reviewer about the DVD/UMD packs. They should lower the UMD price to $10.00 at the most. If they don't do something, i think that the UMD market might crash, and that would not be very good now would it?	4.0	UMD = awesome.	2005-04-21	4	1	3
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3OVG2AHZRGA55	Tyler Durden	I thought Kill Bill was a great film for many reasons, and a bit of a dissapointment for a few others. Ultimately, I thoroughtly enjoyed it, though honestly I can't be bothered to write an actualy review, least of all beacuse I know nobody's gonna read it.I'm an American student on exchange in Tokyo, so I saw this film as it was presented to the Japanese market. At the time, I didn't know it was any different from the American version, other than there being not subtitles during the spoken Japanese. After seeing the film, however, I started seeing things on the internet about the American version being black in white in parts to tone down the violence, so I went out and found that version of the film.Not to dissapoint anyone who was looking for torrents more blood, but there really isn't much of a difference. The only part of the Japanese film that is more violent is the colorized fight scene at the end, but it's only, what, three minutes of the whole scene that's been changed, from when Uma rips that guys eye out until they end up in the blue room for the showdown with the final group of Yakuza.I feel both versions of the film have their merrits. The black and white enhances the visual eclecticism of the film, which goes along with the countlessly shifting colors and anime sequence, while the full color version is much funnier, and the colorized blood is so violently red and copiously abundant that it can't help but make you laugh.The only other difference is that Uma cuts off Sophie Fatal's other arm when she's got her in the trunk of her car. That many have actually been in the American version, but I don't think I saw it. Anyway, so there it is.	4.0	Japanese vs. American Version	2004-03-19	64	45	19
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1WL2EKE4TAEJP	"Tyler Durden ""Mutton Man"""	"Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) get into a small discussion about a pilot episode Mia was involved in called ""The Fox Force Five"" in Tarantino's masterpiece ""Pulp Fiction,"" which has a blonde woman, a Japanese woman, a black woman, a French woman, and Mia's character whose specialty was knives and supposedly known as ""the deadliest woman in the world with a knife."" Unfortunately, it was just the pilot that aired and Mia only got 15 minutes of fame. Nearly ten years later, the Fox Force Five would become resurrected and reincarnated to become the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad in Tarantino's fourth film ""Kill Bill."" The members: Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), aka Copperhead; O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), aka Cottonmouth; Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), aka California Mountain Snake; Budd (Michael Madsen), aka Sidewinder; and lastly, The Bride (Uma Thurman), aka Black Mamba. Bill (David Carradine) is their boss.The Bride (name revealed in Vol. 2) is left for dead when members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and Bill interrupt her wedding by blasting anyone who's anyone, and putting a bullet into the Bride's head. Unfortunately, she miraculously survives, but is left in a coma. She awakens four years later, only to discover that her unborn child is gone, and that her body was used as a ""love machine"" by any perverted men who paid a doctor (called ""Buck"" here) to have sex with her comatose body. She escapes the hospital once she awakens and sets out to kill those who attempted to kill her: The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.This is Tarantino's wackiest, bloodiest, and yet, extremely creative movie he has ever presented to us. The fight sequences and sound effects feel as if we're watching an old martial arts movie from the '60s or '70s. The fast camera zooming to show a close-up of a character's face, avant-garde filming style, and the film's score reminescent of good ol' Bruce Lee films certainly provide us with one thing: art. Of course, Tarantino is known for ripping off other movies, but he works around it by miraculously making it seem innovative and his own. I'm not sure how he does it, but... he does. One of the highlights is the story of O-Ren Ishii. Tarantino could've gotten some actors to do the sequences, but instead, he tells the story through animation... Anime, to be exact.And of course, the bloody fight scenes. They were at one time hailed as the bloodiest sequences in a movie ever, up until ""The Passion of the Christ"" was released. People frown on them by exclaming it as a form of celebrating violence. Compare this to ""Natural Born Killers."" It seemed that movie celebrated violence with Mickey and Mallory getting a kick out of killing whoever they want. ""Kill Bill"" is more over-the-top and cartoony. In other words, it's very unrealistic, which at the same time provides twisted humor. But Tarantino manages to keep the Crazy 88 sequence intact and slip by with a R rating by showing most of itin black and white. Since DVDs are constantly having more special features, why couldn't we have been treated with the sequence presented in color? As I've read elsewhere, the Japanese version of ""Kill Bill"" has the sequence in color.I think one minor character steals the movie and fans seem to think so as well: Go Go Yubari. A teenage girl, dressed in a school girl uniform, and O-Ren Ishii's bodyguard. Is it because of her uniform, or is it because she's the only character that almost got the best of the Bride? It's one or the other, both, or neither, but I'm gonna settle with the latter. Go Go's fighting technique is damn impressive. She does all these crazy tricks with a ball and chain (perhaps that could be another reason she's a fan favorite). She's deadlier than even the Bride or any other character here. Whatever the reason, Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama) just about steals the movie.And another highlight of the movie is the impressive soundtrack. Hearing ""The Lonely Shepard"" by Zamfir is worth buying the soundtrack alone. Just an absolutely beautiful and powerful track. Purchase whenever you get the chance. Oh yeah, can't forget other amazing tracks like ""The Green Hornet"" theme, the movie's theme ""Battle Without Honor or Humanity,"" and ""Twisted Nerve"" (that whistling song). There's many other great tracks as well.Sorry about getting off-topic for a sec there. Tarantino has yet provided us with another masterpiece. I talk of both volumes as just one movie, but as separate, both are equally good. Tarantino still gives us the witty and intelligent dialogue he's best known for (especially in Vol. 2) with an amazing epic storytelling of revenge and loss. Vol. 1 has all the bloody action, and Vol. 2 makes up for the lost storytelling Vol. 1 rushed through. Both are essentials for the Tarantino fanatic. Sadly, the DVDs are lacking. We all know a DVD edition will be released later in the future. I hate it when that happens, but in the meantime, we'll see if one does come along.Anywho, the ""Kill Bill"" saga are works of art."	5.0	Tarantino's fourth film	2005-01-12	3	2	1

The beginning scene is cringeworthy and so unreasonably and unnecessarily graphic - (why?  why must tarantino do this?  do we need to SEE such graphic imagery?  Ever heard of subtlety? implication?) but i figured i'd keep on watching cuz maybe the story would come through or SOMETHIN.  it didn't.  i went back later and gave it another shot, but i wasn't the least bit impressed.This film is pretty sick.  the animated portion is just so.. that anime stuff is truly nasty.  If you don't know, there's a large animated portion of the film that proceeds to show - horrifyingly - how one of the assassins comes to be the assassisin she is.  I seriously wonder at what sort of a mind enjoys this stuff.  But aside from the violence, the films story (and its manner of telling) sucked on its own merit.  The bride (thurman) gets revenge on the people that shot her, one at a time.  for some reason tarantino jumps back and forth in time.  it serves absolutely no purpose.  You remember the end of Pulp Fiction the moment you realized Jules and Vincent were in the same restaurant as Pumpkin and Honey Bunny?  Right before ""Garcon!! Coffee!!""?  Nothing like that genious collision of storyline here.  And the action scenes are utterly lame - save for the very first one where the Bride fights Vivica Fox's character in the house.  THAT was very well executed fight scene.  Aside from that scene, the stuff here looks like a bad high school play.  you should watch the basically flawless wire-fu on display on a film like Crouching Tiger and compare it to what you see here - Thurman looks exactly like there is a wire pulling her back and forth over a Hollywood soundstage.  She very obviously does not know karate.  At times she seems bodily surprised that hers was being pulled in a diection she was not prepared to go.  It's ridiculous.  Not the least bit exhilarating as you hope to see in a kung fu flick.  (remember that awe you felt as a kid when you watched Bruce Lee karate his way through a picture?  You were justifiably awestruck because Lee was an artist.  Thurman is what we call a 'novice')Furthermore this flick is edited terribly.  We get loooonnnng drawn out scenes where nothing much happens.  The worst such scene is the one where the bride goes to the karate masters attic to get the sword.  We see her approach the attic...  locate the sword.. approach the sword.. admire the sword... pick up the sword.. and so on.  As if T. is trying to add depth to his narrative simply by making individual scenes longer.  That doesn't work.  You just end up with a boring film.  You gotta give us something to CHEW on T!"	1.0	pretty bad	2005-10-10	23	6	17

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2AZ46UWM2BXV9	"UncleChris ""mekins"""	I hardly know where to begin, this film being so terribly awful. The fountains and geysers of blood were so over the top as to be laughable. The several hundred &quot;Kato&quot; characters running around left one begging for a cartoon Green Hornet to enter the scene.... it couldn't possibly have been worse than what we got. Uma's in a coma for 4 years, yet in a few hours she's up walking and fighting again. She flies commercially while nonchalantly carrying a Samurai sword. The language would make a sailor blush and run away. A young non-Japanese woman running a Tokyo crime syndicate could happen, right? Has anyone ever heard of a gun??? Uma's character would have been dead many times over (except for the &quot;expert assassin&quot; in the beginning of the movie who shoots at Uma and misses): OOPS! I forgot! At the start, Uma gets shot in the head at close range, yet comes back unscathed. etc. etc. etc. I'd need 10,000 words to list all the garbage that reeks in this film.I thought maybe Tarantino was going for camp, but no..... there's nothing but a few very lame attempts at humor. This idiotic film actually takes itself seriously. It's weak attempts to pay homage to another time and to other films falls flat.Folks.... If you believe Uma Thurman makes a good Samurai, then I've got some property in Florida you might be interested in..... natural irrigation, wildlife.... it's beautiful!!Tarantino is Sam Peckinpah times 10, without his grit or meaning.Look.... The acting's bad, the plot is thin and predictable (did anyone not know after 15 minutes that the baby was alive?), the language and lines are eye-rollingly horrendous, and the blood so deep as to not even be gross. Don't just leave this movie on the shelf, hack it apart with a Samurai sword.... It's the only satisfaction possible out of this gelatinous chunk of dooty.&quot;Run away.....

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AID8OJP77VK6Y	unicornelia	Fast-paced story of revenge! Highly entertaining; audiences should really end up cheering on The Bride as she battles each enemy--the assassins who betrayed her and attempted to murder her--in samurai style with her Hatori Hanzo sword straight from Japan. This high-energy thriller is an epic masterpiece! It's essentially lots of fun to watch. Some of the head-slicing turns out to be humorous, as everyone lightens up to watch red fountains shoot forth in the midst of a serious story. Danger lurks around every plot twist, such as the formidable Go Go and her crazy ball-and-chain. Each part of the movie is an exciting adventure, including the anime segment. It grabs you right at the beginning and holds you in suspence until the end--which is, incidentally, a cliffhanger! &quot;Kill Bill&quot; leaves you wanting the next volume.	5.0	Awesome movie.	2004-05-23	0	0	0

It's got excess, gore, violence, neck-breakign pace, amazing scenery, cultural diversity, witty dialogue, terrific acting, beautiful women.... In other words, this movie delivers the whole package.Some critics attacked the story line as a weak link. I do not agree. The story is strong enough to keep the movie together and allow it to deliver on all of the things I just mentioned. The non-chronological development turned out to be a plus in this case.I give preference to this Volume over the second Volume of Kill Bill, because direct confrontations between the Bride and her enemies are more colorful, more action-filled and in general more entertaining than in this first Volume. The confrontation between the Bride and Vernita Green and later between the Bride and Crazy 88 and Orin Ishii are unmatched in their color, movement and other aethetic values in the second Volume.The Director achieved a perfect synthesis of American action/adventure with his tribute to Asian cinema, with his fascination for and love of women and violence."	5.0	Murderously Entertaining	2005-12-09	5	3	2

It has another 2 minutes worth of footage as to what the distinction is in running times between the Japanese 113 min and the US 111 min version. But the big difference is the House of Blue Leaves in color. Full throttle blood and guts color. The US MPAA forced the washing out of the coloring of blood into gray splattered effects with The Crazy 88's. I mean come on just because it's gray and not red really means anything?!? We all know that it's BLOOD. Just like when Hitchcock filmed Psycho in B & W to avoid the mental challenges of the public of seeing the shower scene in living color.This was the first dvd I got from another country to play on my region free dvd player back in '04. It's one among many now. I only wish that in the supplement sections when the Japanese artists are speaking about what they did in their own language, that there were English subtitles to what they're saying.I really hope that the Japanese artists get their full due in the upcoming Whole Bloody Affair; since none of them showed up on the US dvd version. On the dvd set and their words translated into English.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3SMT15X2QVUR8	"Victoria Tarrani ""writer, editor, artist, des..."	".This is a fast paced thriller filled with wicked battles, and is not for children, nor for all adults.  It is loaded with violence, bloodshed, revenge, and gory action sequences.  If this is not something you tolerate, then you will hate the film.  However, if you can accept this brutality and have never seen Kill Bill Volume 1, be sure to also purchase Volume 2 at the same time.The sword dances are simply amazing, reminding me of the skills used in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""  Flashbacks to the opening scene are a dominant and driving force during both volumes.  The theme song lyrics are associated with characters, plot, action, emotions, determination, and strength.  Now I find the notes, the melody, the words wander through my mind no matter what I do, and I want to see the film again.Quentin Tarantino's use of non-sequential progression is perfect... it worked in ""Pulp Fiction"" and it works in ""Kill Bill.""  His films now fall into my classic ""Viki's Chick Flicks"" category.  The action and violence show me a side of humanity that I hope to never see up close and personal, but I understand it better.The history of Lucy Liu's character O-Ren Ishii is revealed through Tarantino's surprising use of animation, and it succeeds.  She is the only character whose background is revealed.  I was startled to see this animated sequence.  However, the gross violence and other information that reveal what twisted this assassin are strong as it creates verisimilitude for the complex killer, and makes the film formidable.  Though none of the other assassins have their background revealed, it is reasonable to assume that they also have been through such experiences to drive them into their careers.Tarantino ends this flick with a far more emotional connection than I've seen in his previous works.  I found it fascinating that QT used aspects of the classic spaghetti western, the amazing sword frenzy shown through back lighting similar to scenes in ""Flash Dance,"" and other surrealistic filming techniques.I found a few discrepancies in the films, but this is still five stars for a ""Viki's Chick Flick.""Victoria Tarrani"	5.0	Bang, bang, my baby shot me down ...	2004-10-07	4	1	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2JA7C0WEMB1M7	"Virgil ""Virgil"""	To say that Kill Bill is without a plot isn't' exactly correct, rather the plot is quite simple; an ex-lover's pregnant bride-to-be and her wedding party are slaughtered by his gang of trained assassins [she herself at one time a star member of this hit-squad]. She survives, goes into a coma for four years and seeks revenge when she recovers.  Its title should make the level of violence within Kill Bill readily apparent to any potential viewer. And, being a Tarantino film, it's frankly surprising that anyone is surprised.  Suffice it to say that if you subscribe to the Michael Medved school of morality and movie reviews you won't like Kill Bill Vol. 1.Uma Thurman is wonderful as the vengeful bride her, actions set within Tarantino's cool homage-to-the-seventies style.  And what a style it is; everything from the seventies is here, a soundtrack to Ironsides, marital arts stars and a flashy-retro sensibility. It's told in typical Tarantino non-linear fashion with each chapter a different adventure in revenge by Uma. The non-linear style allows the director to slowly reveal the motivation for Uma's character [the character is nameless in Vol. 1 except for her code name- Black Mamba]. The supporting cast, Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah and especially in Vol. 1, Lucy Liu are fantastic.With violence that exceeds the final scene of The Wild Bunch, cinematography that rivals the best in film and a timeless story of revenge Tarantino has built a movie both exceedingly simple and complex. My one and only criticism is that both Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 should have been released as one movie, studio execs be damned.Moralists and those with queasy stomachs should avoid this film. Everyone else be prepared to experience what may be a landmark film, certainly one of the most stylish of the last twenty years.Excellent all around and highly recommended.	5.0	Stylish, Violent and Highly Recommended	2004-08-07	3	3	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1QBQ8N71X5V81	!Vision!	First off, I'm a Tarantino fan. I'm a Tarantino fan. I'm a Tarantino fan. Hmm... sorry... Just have to keep reminding myself of that after seeing this piece of crap. Oh, that's what it is! There is no denying it. It is a big stinking, heaping, load of crap... Sorry Quentin.It is so painfully obvious that because of who he was, Quentin Tarantino was given free reign to do whatever he wanted and what he decided upon was style over substance. For such a talented writer, it is confusing as to how he could write Kill Bill vol. 1. Nothing of his earlier work is present. No humor. No interesting characters. No intelligent dialogue. Heck, there's hardly even any dialogue at all; just a bunch of noise, flashy imagery, and ridiculous amounts of blood.Then there are those lulls, points where the whole narrative just comes to a standstill. They were so boring it made my head hurt. When the action actually began to take place again, I just didn't care anymore. The movie had already dulled my senses. Even if I did care, the action itself was an exercise in idiocy, especially the ending. I just cannot suspend my disbelief enough to believe that one mortal flesh-and-blood person, no matter how masterful, can slaughter an entire room full of sword wielding martial artists. Oh, and then the one-on-one confrontation between the Bride and O-Ren is still supposed to hold some significance. Give me a break! The bride just killed a hundred people! How does O-Ren, or the audience, even concieve that she has a chance.Another thing that drove me crazy was the completely out of place anime sequence. I know Tarantino is known for not following a linear form or adhering to conventions, but having a cartoon right in the middle of your live action picture is too damaging. I like anime, but having it coincide within an actual live action movie doesn't work. It's too distracting. By the time the movie returned to the human actors I had become engrossed in the animation and had forgotten all about them.I wish I had something nice to say, but i don't. I've read other reviews praising the conglomaration of styles; Hong Kong Kung Fu, Spaghetti Westerns, etc. I believe that there's just one style missing however, Quentin Tarantino's.	1.0	Say it ain't so Tarantino	2004-08-17	21	8	13
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ASJ89T42CIUHU	V. Marshall	"Quentin Tarantino has managed to create something unexplainably brilliant with his duo of films, ""Kill Bill."" Only Tarantino could have pulled these films off. Part one is the Eastern version with a huge emphasis placed on the physical aspect of the characters.In KB Pt. 1 we meet ""The Bride"" played fantastically by Uma Thurman. The opening scene is gruesome and starts this film off on a path that others would have totally butchered. Part one is graphic and brutal in some scenes so be prepared, blood flows in buckets here! Thurman is a trained assassin who discovers that she is pregnant and decides to retire, an easy decision but it makes a mountain from a mole hill. Thurman spends the rest of the film seeking revenge for the wrongs she suffers and she does it brilliantly. ""The Bride"" aka ""Black Mamba"" aka Thurman uses the finesse and artistic beauty of Kung Fu and other martial arts to reek havoc on her prey. The fight scenes with Lucy Liu are cinematically beautiful and the group fight is perfectly choreographed. Thurman outdoes herself!Starring with Uma Thurman is a cast of characters played by, Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, Julie Dreyfus, and many stars from the real Kung Fu genre. Tarantino managed to cast his characters perfectly and has created some very interesting foes for Thurman to avenge herself against. The film is told in chapters with each arch enemy dealt with in a great short story. Tarantino shoots with fantastic colors and unique lighting so that each frame is something stunning to behold. He takes a fun stab at Kung Fu films from China, the old spaghetti Westerns from Italy and even a few horror scenes straight out of De Palma's generation. Tarantino winds his way through this film making many little pictures that mesh into one, he has become a master at directing this type of picture and manages to hold the interest of his audiences the entire way.""Kill Bill"" Pt. 1 may not appeal to all people although it is a journey highly recommended for its utter uniqueness, beautiful scenes and great music matched perfectly to the background stories. It is bloody and brutal but in some strange way entirely necessary and not out of context. Between all of the sword fights, Kung Fu kicks and fatal injuries the story is really good. ""The Bride"" is relatable and you will root for Thurman and her stoic vulnerability until the very end. All I can say is Wow!"	5.0	A Masterpiece of Uniqueness Part 1	2004-08-19	3	1	2
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2RFAGXJOB6ZN7	Voracious Reader	I just wish that reviewers would be accurate with their facts.  The Bride is codenamed &quot;Black Mamba&quot; (with an &quot;A&quot;) which is a species of fast and highly poisonous African snake (it can travel up to 12mph and 2 drops of its venom can kill a human in an hour) and which makes sense since she's supposed to be an assassin along with the rest of them.  The &quot;mambo&quot; is a Latin dance step which is definitely *NOT* her codename.  Jeez.While the movie is somewhat gory, the most jarring part is the flipflop from human actors to cheesy cartoon (describing O-Ren Ishii's history) and then back again--they could've used actors!!!  It's even worse than the constant flicking back and forth chronologically (at least the black and white footage helps us to figure out whether we're viewing something in the past or the present).  The best fight scene is the one between The Bride wielding a katana and Gogo Yubari using spiked ball and chain in my opinion.  Even the final fight scene between The Bride and O-Ren Ishiii is a bit of a letdown.	3.0	Mamba, Mamba, MAMBA!!!!	2004-05-31	4	1	3

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1C76USK9IOWW4	"Walter Rhein ""Walter Rhein"""	I recently revisited this kinetic classic from Quentin Tarantino and found myself loving it just as much as I did when it was originally released.  It's fun to see how a film ages, and although Kill Bill might show some wrinkles, it's definitely still a fresh, fun face.  The only reason it might seem as if this film has aged is that it has had such a cinematic influence.The film follows the exploits of &#34;The Bride&#34; played to perfection by Uma Thurman in, perhaps, her definitive role.  The film credits the story to &#34;Q & U&#34; so one must suspect Uma played more than a cursory role in the conception of this character.The Bride goes on a revenge rampage that is less an exercise in realistic storytelling as it is a metaphor for the woman's fury.  She begins the film a pregnant bride who is shot in the head by a scorned lover, has to overcome paralysis and repeated rape, and concludes the film as an almost inhuman robot who sends messages with dismembered low-level minions.As skillful as the choreography and as slick as the dialogue, this a fundamentally very basic film (which is why it's so effective).  It's not difficult to side with the bride.  Any rational human being recognizes that a pregnant woman who is shot in the head can pretty much justify all the anger in the world (which The Bride embodies).  Still, this film gains intensity after a viewing of Kill Bill 2 which also shows preceding events which explain how, although still innocent, the Bride did contribute to the construction of her fate.	5.0	Tremendous, Visceral Action Adventure	2014-03-10	1	0	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2KU5PG32H7QBN	"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic"""	"First of all, this won't be like any Quentin Tarantino movie you've ever seen.  He often makes pop culture references and writes wonderful dialogue.  But in ""Kill Bill: Volume 1,"" he trades in great dialogue for great action sequences and great cinematography, and trades in spoken pop culture references for a one and a half hour long reference (parody) to the old, B-level kung fu movies of the past.  If you understand that he is making an homage/parody, you'll love the film.My main disclaimer would be the violance.  If you have a weak stomach when it comes to realistic gore, come.  If you have a weak stomach for any form of blood/gore, DON'T COME!  Arms are sliced off and heads go flying with huge waterfalls of blood pooring out like that body part was just a dam and there's an entire lake of red hidden inside the body.  For example, a woman's arm is cut off and blood squirts out for about five minutes.  And ten minutes later, you still see her rolling around on the ground, alive.  This is sort of a half disclaimer, because the way Tarantino makes fun of the old kung fu violance will mostly make you laugh, rather than mutter to your date ""this is so stupid.""My second disclaimer is its simple plot.  If you're one who loves complex, ""you have to think every moment"" movies, then you may not like the film unless you're looking for something different.  The plot is as follows: a woman (whose name is beeped out, played by Uma Thurman) is left for dead at her wedding after her former partners in assasination (the Deadly Viper Assasination Squad, or DiVAS) kill her friends and family, and wakes up from a coma four years later with revenge churning in her mind.  And then she goes out to get it.  That's it.  But watch out for the twist at the end...it's a killer!  A great way to end a film.But beyond these two reasons, which I didn't really find as reasons not to see the movie, there is a fun chemical put into the movie you don't get a lot anymore.  Uma Thurman plays her role with Oscar-worthy rage which never leaves her eyes.  And you stare and stare at her, but it never goes away.  She's out for revenge and she won't let it leave her, herself!  It's a joy to watch her.  She makes you laugh and amazes you with every step.  And Tarantino, of course, puts his usual uniqueness and non-linear movie form into it, keeping you locked at every moment.  I hope all will take everything I just said into consideration and see it, or not see it.  Whatever decision you make based on this review means I was successful, one way or the other.Bottom Line:  A fun, exciting, hilariously bloody flick that will have people talking from the moment the credits begin rolling.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2DBPCXGRAPAJU	Warren Taylor	"Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill is the most quintessential movie that I've seen to date vis-&agrave;-vis revenge, gratuitous violence, blood, gore and human carnage.  It is extremely over-the-top.  It captures the essence of kung fu, black comedy, spaghetti westerns, Black exploitation films, etc. to the Nth degree.  I, however, did not find the over-the-top parallels to be ingenious or the slightest bit humorous.  Of course, the movie has out done all of the revenge themes of the Kung Fu movies that I've ever seen.  For doing this, Torentino should win an academy award.Quentin Tarantino is indeed catering to people's most bass impulses of violence and sex. Why not? Violence in cartoons, TV programs, music, and movies are very popular and has been part of the American culture since its beginning.  I'm not saying that we should be Pollyannish and deny the aggressive and sexual impulses that we all have, but must they be displayed to such a pornographic and graphic level that should make even Larry Flynt, the owner of Hustler magazine, blush.Many of the scenes look like something out of an animal slaughterhouse, except that it was human bodies being butchered by the blonde heroine, who was a former assassin who was out to exact revenge on those who tried to kill her at her wedding.  The white heroine appeared to have cartoonish super powers of Superwoman and of any of the DC, and Marvel Comic Book heroines and heroes.Overall, Kill Bill comes across as extremely racist, especially with the white, blonde and beautiful white heroine (Uma Thurman) killing a multitude of Asians, and killing off the beautiful African American actress, Vivica Fox, at the beginning of the movie.  While I was watching this movie, I did not see any Asians and African Americans laughing or being impressed with the movie.  Based on what I saw, Tarantino would careless.  The KKK could really use him to develop some excellent racist propaganda.  Tarantino's Kill Bill is right up there with filmmaker D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation.  Reviews of this movie have stated, ""Despite protests, Birth sold more tickets than any other movie, a record that stood for decades, and President Woodrow Wilson famously compared it to ""history written in lightning.""From reading reviews, Kill Bill is Tarantino's masterpiece film to date.  The Birth of a Nation was D.W. Griffith's.  I must say that I don't know anything about Tarantino's political views, or his personal life.  Personally, I did not find anything new, ingenious or creative about Kill Bill.I strongly believe that art, be it good or bad, reflects what is going on in a person's unconscious and conscious mind, and that Tarantino has extremely strong aggressive and violent proclivities that are being played out in his films.  Although being a popular filmmaker is empowering and has undoubtedly has made him very rich, his movies suggest that he still has unresolved feelings of powerlessness and impotence on many levels.Nevertheless, I'm debating whether or not to see the sequel.  I found it quite interesting that the heroine in Kill Bill did not have a name.  In the movie, she is just referred to as the Bride, which resulted in me thinking of the film The Bride of Frankenstein.  In Kill Bill, the Bride is a creation of Bill/Tarantino, and is out to destroy Bill and his associates.In addition, I couldn't keep the names of Electra out of my mind as it relates to the heroine, and Oedipus as it relates to Tarantino.  I can't help but surmise that the daughter that the heroine was pregnant with at the time she was left for dead was delivered while she was in a coma, and was being raised by Vivica Fox's character.  Of course, the racially mixed daughter of Fox's will either grow up and unknowingly and knowingly kill her mother, who is more than likely the heroine, or the heroine will knowingly and unknowingly kill her daughter.  This would be a very interesting ending to Kill Bill, along the lines of a Greek tragedy; however, the gratuitous violence of Tarantino's films will more than likely keep me from seeing the blood-curdling conclusion.In closing, I can't help but wonder how Lucy Liu felt about playing in a role that saw her and a multitude of other Asians brutally destroyed by the blonde heroine of this movie. I'm really wondering what Asians have to say about Kill Bill.  I've had my say.  Of final note, the movie should have a significantly higher rating than R, and it is best seen and digested on an empty stomach."	1.0	The Bride of Tarantino	2003-10-13	27	11	16

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	ADA4GGFWDKTYD	Watching and waiting	I recently rewatched Volumes 1 and 2 of Kill Bill on Amazon Instant Prime for the first time since seeing the two films in theaters when they first came out.  I liked them on first viewing, but this time around came to appreciate them for the extraordinary pieces of film-making they are.  QT marries his vast knowledge of a century of movies with the full bag of modern technological opportunities to synthesize a masterpiece.Kill Bill was the opener of Tarantino's trilogy of revenge fantasy movies, movies about oppressed groups who get their own back with change.  A trilogy so far, anyway, unless he decides to continue it.  Kill Bill about women, Inglorious Basterds about Jews, Django Unchained about blacks.  That is a primally satisfying theme, to me at least.	5.0	Volume 1 of a classic	2014-04-14	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A180JJI7WPRXK7	WatchOverMe	"I saw this movie in the theathers last year and ever since then I been addicted to it. I don't know how Tarantino does it but he made a great movie. Yes, I'm very aware that Vol.1 and Vol.2 were suppose to be one whole movie. But Miramax split them and so we have two films. Even with the split I'm very drawn to vol.1.It's been quite awhile since we seen an action heroine on the screen. Kill Bill is like no other. It delivers! These lovely femme fatales are exactly what movie goers like me enjoyed. They are vicious, violent and sometimes evil! Take a closer look at the character of O-Ren Ishii. Not only is she evil and very deadly, but also beautiful and charming. But even with that beauty a hidden wicked soul lies hidden. She is only but a victim of her own violent enviroment.The character of Gogo is very hard to analyze because she is so young and spoiled. But don't let that cute teen smile fool you! She'll cut your guts before you can even say ""help"".Vernita Green is the character we see less in the movie. But we come to see that she is the prime example of what the Bride is trying to achieve.And now the Bride! WOW!!! Not only is the character very beautiful and sexy, but she is the reason why Kill Bill is so damn exciting! This lady takes no crap from anybody she is one mean killing machine! This woman wants revenge and anyone that is involved will pay.......with their lives.Overall the movie is a must see. The DVD is a must own! I'm glad I got it and despite the fact it doesn't have much I still enjoyed the movie. Quentin Tarantino is by far a suscefull director and ignore the haters for obviously they care more about bashing him than to recognize his skills in movie making. A must have for Tarantino fans!

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3STPF8MRTJXFN	W. Doyle	I thought Pulp Fiction was the best film of the 90s, which pains me to say, because the decade contains Goodfellas and Martin Scorcese is my favorite director. When you consider PF along with Reservoir Dogs and the True Romance screenplay, Tarantino emerges as one of the singular voices of the past 35 years. But it seems he has lost it. Yes, there are flashes of brilliance here (Uma's initial meeting with fighting master Pei Mei is mesmerizingly cool and surreal). However, it seems as if more than 50% of this film is spent in having to listen to David Carradine's Bill ramble on about the film's backstory. It's a film Quentin, not a novel.	2.0	Tarantino has lost his touch	2008-12-30	3	1	2

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A18M68DE1Y6W51	Wendy Kaplan	This is a review written by an ordinary, non-cinema buff whose only other encounter with a Tarantino film was Pulp Fiction. I rented this movie (which I have now ordered for my own) simply out of curiosity, and nothing more.What can I say. I was blown away. From the mixture of genres (spaghetti western to anime to old-time badly dubbed black and white Asian flicks) to the incredible camera work to the kick-you-know-what acting (and fighting) to the mix of color and black and white to the incredible but somehow-it-works plot, this is simply an experience not to miss.Yes, it is incredibly violent. It is also incredibly fun, incredibly beautiful, incredibly exciting, incredibly everything. I loved the Japanese girl group (especially the two extra songs in the additional scenes); I loved the beautiful choreography of the final fight in the snow; I loved Uma Thurman half to death; I loved Lucy Liu; I loved the wickedly evil cameo by Darryl Hanna; sheer spectacle of the entire thing.And while I normally eschew the directors' comments as incredibly boring, NOTHING about Tarantino's comments are boring. He explains the movie with such enthusiasm, such complete lack of self-consciousness, either professional or personal, that you feel he is having a drink with you in your livingroom. Fascinating, endearing, wonderful.Simply a must-watch, must-own DVD, in my own humble opinion.	5.0	Pure Genius	2004-04-19	3	2	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A4UKBG3M5U5TI	Westley	"Quentin Tarantino triumphantly returned to directing after a 6 year absence with the exhilarating ""Kill Bill, Volume 1.""  Uma Thurman stars as ""The Bride,"" a deadly assassin who has been betrayed and left for dead by her cronies.  When she recovers, she seeks vengeance on them in a most spectacular manner.  The film is perfectly cast, with Uma in particular giving one of her best performances ever.""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" is as stylized a movie as you're likely to see - it seems to exist in a world never before seen.  The fight scenes are clearly the heart of the action-packed ""Volume 1,"" and each ml&eacute;e is highly distinct, making the sections of the movie highly memorable.  The film is truly a mish-mash of styles - with elements of karate movies, spaghetti westerns, anime, and 70s exploitation films.  However, even though Tarantino swipes from so many genres, the result is his own peculiar blend.The film is told in an episodic manner, replete with title cards announcing each ""chapter.""  In addition, each ""chapter"" has been conceptualized and filmed in a different style.  As always, Tarantino has found the perfect music to accompany scenes, with the help of rapper RZA.  Perhaps his greatest strength as a director is matching a cool visual to the right music, even employing music from pan-flute player Zamfir!  I'm not always a fan of action films, but I was genuinely blown away by this movie.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A3N5XIM9R2OQH0	Wheelchair Assassin	"If ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" were vintage Quentin Tarantino, ""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" is Tarantino after an all-day crack-and-acid binge.  It's a nonstop barrage of ideas, allusions, and above all, violence.  The gritty urban realism of Tarantino's twin early triumphs has been replaced with a bizarre, schizophrenic revenge fantasy that reveals Tarantino's blatant fascination with Westerns and Japanese Samurai films.  He throws jarring visuals (and watery blood) at you with such relentless regularity that by the end the effect has become numbing, but your eyes will probably be glued to the screen just the same.After a brief intro, the movie opens with a brilliantly offbeat scene that shows Tarantino at his best.  One moment, Uma Thurman's nameless Bride pulls up to a house and knocks on the door.  The next, a woman opens up, and there's a searing flash of recognition that recalls, of all things, the Chinese pulp Kung Fu classic ""The Five Fingers Of Death.""  And just as you're processing this, two gorgeous young women are engaging in a death-defying martial arts brawl that's interrupted when one's daughter gets home from school to find a strange woman in her house and broken glass all over the floor.  Everything Tarantino is crammed into these ten or so minutes: wit, action, directorial dexterity, and out-of-left-field surprises that will floor discerning cinephiles (is that a word?).""Kill Bill"" is definitely Tarantino's starkest and rawest film (ok, I haven't seen ""Jackie Brown,"" but there's no way it could beat ""Kill Bill"" in this regard), both when it's speeding along with hyperkinetic vigor and when it slows down to focus on some smaller detail.  When Thurman's Bride wakes from her coma and realizes both what's happened to her and where she is, it's a truly harrowing moment in the midst of the insanity more often on display.  Of course, seconds later we discover that a male nurse has been prostituting her comatose body in another one of those ""What kind of mind thinks of this stuff?"" scenes that Tarantino has seemingly trademarked.  Moments after that, following a brutally harsh scene in the Bride's hospital room, the bloodbath is on.""Pulp Fiction,"" as everyone and their brother knows by now, consisted of a series of vignettes tenuously connected by a few unifying plot threads, and ""Kill Bill"" takes that concept to its logical extreme.  Like ""Pulp Fiction,"" the action is out of sequence, but ""Kill Bill"" has an even more disjointed feel than its predecessor.  On its most basic level it's a revenge fantasy, but the movie uses its underlying plot to venture into all sorts of territory befitting a filmmaking mind as scattershot as Tarantino's.  Of special note is the Japanese anime chapter ""The Origin Of O-Ren Ishii"" revealing how Liu's character came to be a Yakuza boss in her mid-20's.  Filled with equal amounts of blood and pathos, the scene may not have much to do with the plot, but it's still damn entertaining.Of course, the most grabbing (and sure to be controversial) aspect of ""Kill Bill"" is the shockingly extreme nature of the violence.  Whether intentionally or not, Tarantino has become a mainstream filmmaker, and mainstream cinema has rarely if ever been this bloody.  Limbs and heads fly off with alarming regularity, and that's just the start; the stage-blood budget for this movie was probably more than Thurman got paid.  Films like ""Fight Club"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" occasionally use in-your-face violence to shock, or in service of a larger point, but Tarantino's motivations are clearly less serious.  If anything, he's paying tribute (he likes doing that) to the more over-the-top aspects of martial-arts movies, and the brilliantly obvious use of stage blood lends a cartoonish air to the proceedings.  When Liu decapitates the hapless Boss Tanaka and and his neck spews fake blood like Old Faithful, it's so outrageous that it's, well, funny.Everything comes to a culmination in the movie's epic concluding swordfight, which makes anything in ""The Matrix"" seem like mere child's play.  Forget for a moment any concerns about realism.  Of course Uma Thurman couldn't take on a couple hundred sword-wielding Yakuza members at once, especially given the fact that no human being has the wind to kill so many people with a sword in such rapid succession.  What really matters is that this scene, gratuitously graphic though it may be, is a feast for the eyes the likes of which you can scarcely imagine.  It's actually somewhat refreshing to see violence on such a grand and guilt-free scale.  I think the vast majority of people are drawn to such massive carnage whether they want to admit it or not, and fortunately Tarantino is only too happy to indulge our fascination.  And there's even one incredibly hilarious throwaway moment that I won't divulge, but suffice to say it's pure Tarantino.None of what I've written above is to say that this is a perfect movie, or even in the same stratospheric region as ""Reservoir Dogs"" or (to a lesser extent, in opinion) ""Pulp Fiction.""  Much of the movie has a self-conscious, weird-for-the-sake-of-being-weird air, playing as much like the work of an overly earnest Tarantino impersonator as an actual Tarantino film.  Some will surely be entertained by Tarantino's frequent detours, but others may well walk out of the theater asking ""where was the plot?"" and Tarantino's commitment to eclecticism could be taken by some for incoherence.  The film also suffers from an obnoxiously overbearing soundtrack that typically did nothing but distract.Still, ""Kill Bill"" is a Quentin Tarantino movie, and therefore worth seeing if only because it's different.  His movies have always provided a nice middle ground for those who find mainstream movies stupid and those who find indie movies boring, and this one is no different.  Few can combine a flair for esoterica so effectively with a populist instinct.  In sum, volume one of this two-part saga is an enjoyable as it is intentionally trashy.  Now bring on volume two!"	3.0	Overkill in every sense of the word imaginable	2003-10-18	6	3	3

However, I couldn't help but enjoy the humour injected various scenes and then seconds later Uma slices and dices her opponents. It wasn't as gory as I thought it would be, however it still has some explicit scenes depicting some of the killings. It is mostly about revenge, however, it is not revealed why Bill attacked the bride in the first place. Hopefully Vol. 2 tells us that.	5.0	Bloody awesome...	2005-07-21	2	1	1

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2KY905FRDVT5M	"Wilhelm Louis Murg Jr. ""Wilhelm Murg"""	Tarantino's lifelong ode to 1970s exploitation/drive-in/grind house films began with film noir (Reservoir Dogs) went through Blackploitation (Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown) and Zombie filx (his work on From Dusk to Dawn) and now we're up to the Kung Fu/Hong Kong years with KILL BILL VOL.1.  When I first saw the film I was a little disappointed, especially as David Carradine and Michael Madson were billed as being in the film, but neither of them show up for very long.  I bought the film on DVD, just to see it again before going to see vol. 2, and I liked it a lot better on the second round.  I like Kung Fu films, but I never became as obsessed with them as I did over early splatter films and film noir, so I'm missing some of the jokes (for example, the short documentary on the DVD points out that the actor playing the sword maker is actually continuing a role he made famous on Japanese television).The criticism that this film is too light or pointless sounds a lot like the flipside of the criticism that JACKIE BROWN (which was a fine film) was too serious and not enough fun.  Tarantino is never going to make PULP FICTION again, so everyone needs to get over it. PULP was an amazing moment where the right people came together with the right attitude and created a classic. I have no doubt that Tarantino will make something even greater, but it might take awhile.In the meantime we have KILL BILL VOL.1 (with Vol. 2 opening in the theatres as I write this, and Vol. 3 is bouncing around in Tarantino's mind).  The weakest aspects of the film are Uma Thurman and Lucy Lui.  Thurman just doesn't have much presence (compare the way Travolta and Jackson's careers exploded after PULP FICTION to Thurman's near disappearance) and Lucy Lui is beautiful to look at, but never really seems to raise to the call in this film (we'll have to wait a few years before Tarantino casts Chiaki Kuriyama, who plays the young, crazed asasasin Gogo, in a film- she steals every scene she appears in).KILL BILL is a fun homage to Asian cinema with touches of westerns and film noir mixed in for maximum violence.  In the documentary on the DVD Tarantino talks about how he's trying to create a homage to the Kung Fu film the same way Spielberg and Lucas created their homage to matinee serials in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  This film was designed to be non-stop action, while Vol. 2 is supposed to be more character driven (like the director's other films).  Overall, it's a good movie, and I while I might consider it #3 if I were ranking the four Tarantino films (I'm sure film just to remind everyone that he did NOT direct Natural Born Killers, True Romance, Desperado, From Dusk to Dawn, etc.) it's a lot more interesting than most popular action films (like the Die Hard series) and funnier than most attempts at comedy today (Old School comes to mind).  For people who want to see PULP FICTION again, they should probably just watch PULP FICTION and forget about trying anything new.With all of that said, we all know the DVD will ultimately be a rip-off.  After Vol.2 comes out you know there will be a special edition that will make this one seem pointless.  Tarantino still hasn't put in a director's commentary track (the only one he has recorded was for FROM DUSK TO DAWN, and he didn't even direct that film) and the extras are just the short documentary, a couple of songs by The 5,6,7,8s (who I find unlistenable, and I love surf punk music) and trailers of the director's other films.

That much makes sense, in a movie-script kind of way, but much not else does. Like why for example.The killer sent to finish her off in the hospital puts on the white nurse uniform, down to the white nurse eyepatch with cute little red cross. There's just too much like that, silly details that work against whatever is trying to be believable. Like sitting on a plane, samurai sword at hand (?!), writing ""Death List"" in letters big enough for people to read from the back of the theater, or at least walking down the aisle in the plane. Or an opening quote, translated form the original Klingon. The shower-spray bleeding is another, especially when loss of blood doesn't seem to have any medical significance to that lawyer.That anime sequence didn't work for me either. It just made the movie look indecisive. Or that section in the big fight scene where everything turned black-and-white for about ten minutes.

Amazon should provide negative stars ranking option!I can't believe so many people said it's ""entertaining"". Entertaining to watch chopping off crowds of people's feet, arms and head? That's why we need so many psychologists. If you guys/gals wanna relieve stress, please go for healthier activities like swimming.There's so much non sense in this movie that I can't stop laughing. This pregnant woman got shoot in the head could wake up from a coma because of mosquito bit. She can't even walk and she can have so much strength to kill two people right the way. Just by concentrating on the words ""wriggle your toe"" and she can walk after hours, woo...then we don't need physical therapy anymore. And she can carry a sword on the airplane, walking around in crowded city with no one interfere. The killing scenes are way too exaggerated, whenever people's head or arms got chopped off, their blood shot into the air like fountain and water tapes. And one of them can still remain conscious, cry and talk after hours! Nails hit the girl's head, but blood rans out from her eyes instead.The main character is described pretty in the movie several times, but she isn't pretty at all. Her yellow suit is obviously a plagiarization of Bruice Lee's.Several reviewers describe this as a culture classic. You mean bringing this sort of brutal killing to modern civilized 21st century in such a non sense story is a ""culture classic""? Martial arts does have its beauty, but it is not presented in this movie. All performed is its misuse for inhuman man slaughter which is so exaggerated and unreal that make this movie pointless.

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2YS8G30VYUN6C	"W. Russell ""warussl"""	"The fourth film by writer/director Quentin Tarantino is not the dialog driven stories that his others were.  Instead, Tarantino set out to make a Hong Kong style action flick in the tradition of the Shaw Brothers movies in which he is so fond.  Being a big Tarantino fan, I wasn't sure what to expect and I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised.  Taking inspiration from a number of kung fu movies and adding his personal touch, Tarantino has created a daring and stylish film (actually two films.  Volume 2 is due out early next year) about revenge.  Uma Thurman is the main character known only as ""The Bride"".  Beaten, shot, and left for dead on her wedding day she survives to take revenge on those responsible.  The would be killers are part of a band of five deadly assassins played by Darrel Hanna, Michael Madson, Lucy Liu, and Vivica A. Fox (Uma Thurman is the fifth of the group).  Paying tribute to the martial arts classic ""The Five Deadly Venoms"", each has a codename of a species of snake.  In fact the film pays homage to and takes inspiration from several martial arts classics. Sonny Chiba and Gordon Liu are given prominent roles.  There are also several references to other Tarantino films throughout (like the ""Elvis"" glasses from true romance or the Red Apple cigarettes ad.  This only adds to the fun of his films.Tarantino does a great job of giving the back story on each of the characters (at least the ones in Volume 1) as the film unwinds from chapter to chapter, but not necessarily in chronological order.  He shows a lot of cinematic style throughout.  One example is the animation used to tell the story of O-Ren.  The fighting sequences are nothing short of fantastic as one would expect with Yuen Wo Ping  and Sonny Chiba assisting with the choreography.  Kill Bill is quite violent (in an martial arts action kind of way) with engrossing action segments and blood the sprays from the arteries of the wounded/defeated as limbs are literally hacked off.In the end, Kill Bill will not appeal to everyone, but there is no doubt Tarantino hit the mark he was aiming for.  He has taken his unique ability and deep understanding of little known movie gems and turned them into a film that is sure to please all Tarantino fans.  Leave the kids at home and go check out another great movie from ""Q"".  Highly recommended."	5.0	Tarantino Does It Again!	2003-10-13	1	0	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2A7T7HIWTK2X7	"W. Wilson ""W.Wilson"""	"After watching about 25 minutes of this movie, I'd had enough and asked my friend to please stop the DVD. I felt like I was going to vomit, my reaction was so visceral to the goings on.There is something deeply disturbed in the minds of the people who created this; it's not even the overblown violence that's most disturbing here but the total lack of morality of any of the characters. Violence is met with violence. In the first 25 minutes, you get to see (SPOILER WARNING):- a pregnant woman shot in the head at close range- a four-year-old girl witness her mother's death by knife- a coma victim (pimped out by a hospital orderly) nearly rapedI can't believe people want to watch this stuff in their precious leisure time!I also detect a contempt for America in this film. That is, the trappings of American life (e.g., the house in the 'burbs, a yellow school bus dropping a child off at home) are just a veneer and just below the surface we're all itching to get our ya-yas out on each other via martial arts training.Finally, I find it interesting that Mel Gibson is taken to task for his ultra-violent films (none of which I've seen - he's no friend of mine), yet Mr. Tarrantino gets a pass! ""Well, it's stylized violence"" Yeah? Not so stylized that this reviewer can walk away from it without disturbing images haunting me for who knows how long."	1.0	This Is Deeply Disturbing for Reasons OTHER Than the Violence	2007-01-02	21	8	13
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1Q15TP2FXYYMF	"www.steveo2006.co.uk ""Steveo"""	This is my second favorite film by Quentin Tarentino (my first bieng Pulp Fiction), a large part of it's 'greatnes' is the amazing amount of blood and gore, i just loved the big fight (the one before she fights Lucy Lui), the spurting blood and cool moves make it an awesome mass-killing scene.The acting in this film is great, Umer Thermon, Lucy Lui plus some other good actors all take part in making this film as good as it is. And the way it turns black and white for a while is good too along with the cartoon scenes aswell!And the last point wich i had to bring up sooner or later is that this film is directed by the one and only Quentin Tarantino who of course brought us many great film like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill volume, and this film and many other great films, he's also acted in some films.This is an exelent film wich should be watched by everyone who has time to do so!	5.0	A Bloody Good Movie	2006-06-25	0	0	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1Y87CGW677R88	"Xavier I. Ucar Conte ""No Hay Dia"""	3.5 stars.It's very hard to explain what's really going on in Tarantino's head. Even though I studied filmmaking, I don't like to critizice...making a movie is a very hard job and by I can't considered my self to make someone else movie better. I wont reviewed coz everybody elses have but there is some very positive elements you should keep in mind before viewing. For those of you who haven't got the pleasure to experience asian cinema, you will find this movie as the most unique and creative motion picture alive...but it's not. If you watch asian cinema you will see how much Tarantino takes from them and how little creative knowledge and originality he puts into his pictures. First of all the plot is very simple, a doublecross/revenge, almost every movie has the same plot...now lets give it something diferent and that's where those that have influenced Trantino come into the picture and I can't name a thousand...from Jackie Chan to Sonny Chiva to Gordon Liu to Sammo Hung etc. from Juen Woo Ping to John Woo to Wong Kar Wai to kitano and even the great takashi miike (best director alive)or even not asian directors like Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah. Now, I'm not saying that being influenced by the great ones is wrong, not at all, but my argument is when you imitate something that has been done alot and make it a trade mark, like something taht should have your name coz you brought it up from the ashes. Here you have the best from, Battle Royale,tokio story, Ichi the Killer, Pistol Opera, Fireworks, A better Tomorrow, Master of the Flying Guillotine, Black Mask, dead or Alive, the Street Fighter, Iron Monkey, Yakusa films, blaxploitetion, Euro horror and so and so and so....this ceirtanly means that Tarantino is not someone who control the medium, but all the others I did mentioned do! A huge gap was the dialogue, it will never be as sharp as Reservoir or Pulp, he just can't handle it. I'm not saying it is a bad movie, because its not..it was actually pretty entertaining but for me is just a sequel to someone elses great movie. So when you go see it, do not walk out saying is the most creative and original thing you have ever seen cause its not...but lets say is a good introduction and a great chance for the american public to see what Asian cinema can offer a million times better.	3.0	Too much will never fit in too little!	2003-12-17	7	1	6

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A26QDPB1UNJGQP	Yoshua Nizar	"Where to begin. This movie is my second favourite movie only second to Kill bill Vol. 2. This movie boasts a star studded cast of Uma Thurman, Michael Madsen, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, Lucy Liu and the legendary David Carradine, with a special appearence by the also legendary Sonny Chiba.Tarrantino delivers such an amazing story that cannot be rivalled by any other movie made. This movie is trademark tarrantino, but the whole movie is done in a brilliant new movie making style all together. Its like a patchwork of different short stories each done in their own styles. You see the film take on different characteristics as you go from a scene shot under a regular lense, to a black and white to highten certain elements of that scene, to anime, to a warmer coloured lense and so much more. This is without a doubt one of the most artistically done movies i have ever seen.The movies litteraly starts off with a bang, making the viewer watch and just go ""whoa"" and the ending is equally good in that its one of the best cliffhangers you'll see.The music intertwines perfectly with the mood of the scene making you feel every twist and turn the movie takes.Overall this movie is a girl power movie but i beleive that men can enjoy this movie still. It's a story about love, a story about motherhood, a story about revenge and mostly a story about doing all the wrong things for all the right reasons.Their is a lot of japanese influence in this movie to bring out the honor of fighting and how honourable it used to be to use one's own skill to defeat your enemies. The skill of the art of fighting. Thus making it the newest old skool martial arts movie there is.Tarrantino fans can appreciate the ""over the top"" style of the movie and non-Tarrantino fans will love it right away. This was the first Tarrantino movie i watched and it made me a Tarrantino fan as i discovered the rest of his movies. This is beyond a shadow of a doubt the crowning jewel in the Tarrantino collection and a recommend it to anyone.The story follows a bride who is on a journey to claim what is rightfully her's; the lives of each and everyone responsible for putting her in a four year coma and the murder of her unborn baby. The journey not only takes us to where she's going but also to what brought her to where she is now.There are some amazing fight scenes, that rival some of the action greats, with enough blood to send aid to the whole of Africa.There are only a handfull of movies that recieve a 5 out of 5 from me, and this is definitely one of those few. In fact if it was possible i'd give this film a sixth star. Now buy it and watch it, because i guarantee you wont regret it."	5.0	Thrill filled: 6 out of 5	2007-11-18	2	2	0
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A2J3MR64L567OK	Yossarian	This movie is truly bad.  It's basically what you'd get if you gave a nerdy 15 year old anime freak $50 million dollars and told him to make a movie.  There is no character development what so ever.  Uma Thurman, laughably cast as some sort of superninja, goes to point A, kills 5 people, goes to point B, kills 10 people, and so on and so on.  There is no sense of a greater world; there are no citizens, no bustling streets, nothing.  The few non-slaughtered minor characters appear, recite a few quirky lines, and vanish again.  Basically the entire film is a video game, where Uma kills a bunch of minions, then an end boss, then moves to the next level and starts all over again.  Go play Shinobi instead, it'll only cost you a quarter.And, for the record, I really dug Pulp Fiction, Resevoir Dogs, True Romance, and Natural Born Killers so it's not as if I haven't enjoyed another Tarantino film.  But this isn't even a film, it's just a bunch of stuff that happens, and no matter how hard to try to imagine there is some clever tongue-in-cheek homage or even parody going on, it ends up just being stupid.  Don't say I didn't warn you.	1.0	Cartoonishly bad	2003-10-12	48	21	27

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	AZTOAD13FDS58	ZenPenguin	"Tarantino again creates a movie that is baffling, engaging, revolting, confusing, meandering and forcefully driving, all in one film and often at the same time.Uma Therman's character, known simply as ""The Bride"" is out to avenge the murders committed at her wedding by her former DiVAS associates (Deadly Viper Assassination Squad).  She is will, purpose and revenge incarnate, allowing her superhuman abilities meant to mirror traditional Asian superheroes.  Think of the girl in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" but instead of just beating people up, she tears them to shreds.  Lots of blood and body parts.  Her purpose is to avenge, and that's just what she does.She avenges.That's really what the movie is all about.Now, the real impact of a Tarantino movie is that you simply don't know what will happen next.  Will the Great Hattori Hanzo, renowned-swordmaker-turned-sushi chef, make us laugh or wind up splattered on the floor?  Or both?  What's the deal with Go-Go, the 17 year old bodyguard who's unbelievably hot and utterly vicious?  And what is the meaning of that wry smile on Lucy Lui, who is like a tigress in her killing and control.Kill Bill is intelligent, well-crafted, insightful moviemaking, which is surprising for such a cheesy concept.  It will not ""blow you away"" the same way Pulp Fiction did the first time you saw it, but it IS classic Tarantino.  Whether or not that is a compliment or a deal-breaker is clearly an individual choice."	4.0	I LIKED this movie	2004-05-14	2	1	1
B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1O7E72EQTCHHB	"Ziwei Li ""tidalkingv"""	"I was going to write my normal format of review, and then realized there isn't much can be reviewed. The story is very simple, like many early Chinese kung-fu movie. There is only one theme: revenge. Uma Thurman is set out revenge for her being shot and her lost baby. Uma Thurman is going to kill Bill-her former boss and the one who sent her into a coma; and she is going to kill him and everyone who is standing between her and him. You kill me, and I will kill you. Just like that.And since there isn't much of story, the whole movie is a showcase of how to tell a story. Or rather, see how Uma kill. You will get a mixed of fist fighting, knife fighting, kung-fu fighting, and samurai sword fighting. The whole movie is placed in a totally different world from ours. For example, I doubt you will see people carrying their big samurai sword onto an airplane.Anyways, this is a highly stylized movie, you will see black and white, Hong Kong wired works, Japanese anime, yakuza showdown...all Asian influences. The movie is simply outrageous-action film in its simplest, purest form. And all is exciting.You will see when people bleed, they don't just bleed. Their blood shoot out like a jet; the blood will shoot up to the ceiling and coming down like rain. People will bath in blood, literally.And the final showdown at a snow-falling Japanese garden, two beautiful women (Uma & Lucy) waving big samurai swords, fighting with flamingo music is just too erotic.It is not a movie that will win awards, or to be discussed afterwards over a coffee. But it is fun and exciting to watch. The audience not only cheered for Uma, but gave a round of applauds after. That is pretty rare if you considering this is a ""B"" movie.Go see Uma kill Bill.(...)"	5.0	movie making in its purest, most fun	2004-03-21	0	0	0

B00005JMEW	Kill Bill, Vol. 1	A1O55RSRIC2FIR	Zuby	Kill Bill volume 1 is a sensorial ride that took me to places I had never been before. An elaborately told plot, split into two films, each perfect in their own way. The gore was nothing. It wasn't graphic, just constant. Hosepipe blood. Wow. Get over it. It's rated R because of SWEARING and CONCEPTS, not because of the violence. That's why they say 'Adult themes.' It's funny, it's exciting, it has Michael Madsen and David Carradine, the two greatest male actors of all time. Quentin Tarantino has produced yet another amazing film that would not look out of place in any DVD library.	5.0	The Sensorial Ride	2004-06-12	1	0	1

Yet Again Quentin Tatantino has tickled our taste buds with another of his great works!A breath taking movie..the Choreograhpy of the stunning fight scences was remarkable. The Showdown at the House of Blue Leaves was very well done. The unique style of the butchery was grotuoteous in a sadisticly pleasing manner.Uma was Sexy Stunning and perfect is the Sleek Yellow  number roaring through the throng dealing with those who stopped her aim to Kill Bill. She played the role superbly, enacting all types of scenes with focus, passion and adaptibility!O-Ren-Ishi was radiating SEX appeal with her powerful indepndent and controlling part.She rose to the role unprecedentd and played the part well. Her fight sequence was sorrowful, artful and challanging, the swtich from english to japaneese, the whispered and shouted dialouge, the fast paced attacks to the slow dance like moves left me encaptivated.Vernita Green- The film with her fight scene with Uma. a Perfect start which left us wishing they had fought a little more.It was fast paced, bitchy and damn she could fight.Her butcher look with her Knife was great,She radiated sassy caty and im a bitch so stear clear look.The gun in the cornflakes bit..leaves me afraid of whenever it comes near to brekfast time!The Cast were GREAT! each playing thier role fantasticly,Sophie Fatalle bled sexiness in her organised and all knowing role!Gogo was Crazy, menacing and disturbingly entertaining!Hantori was entertaining and a superb actor!The cultural insight, the emphasis on the pride, respect and importance of the Samuri sword was great! The Theme of the Movie was interesiting and leaves me in great anticipation for Volume Two! The Music was great, varied and perfect for each scene!TO sceptics and Critics all i will say is wait for Volume Two and then decide, it needs to be viewed in Full till to you can judge it! ...am i being insane in yearning a Volume 3?! yes maybe i am..Thanks for reading hope this was helpful!	5.0	Roaring Rampage	2005-01-15	3	2	1
