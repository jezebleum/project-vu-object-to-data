B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1XYM0DQWWHQEK	&#354;&#615;&#7709; &#354;&#7709;&#7689;&#615...	Intelligent police style show. good acting, action and intriguing story line.The Wire is an American crime drama television series set and produced in and around Baltimore, Maryland. Created and primarily written by author and former police reporter David Simon, the series was broadcast by the premium cable network HBO in the United States. The Wire premiered on June 2, 2002, and ended on March 9, 2008, comprising 60 episodes over five seasons.Each season of The Wire introduces a different facet of the city of Baltimore. In chronological order they are: the illegal drug trade, the seaport system, the city government and bureaucracy, the school system, and the print news media. The large cast consists mainly of character actors who are little known for their other roles. Simon has said that despite its presentation as a crime drama, the show is &#34;really about the American city, and about how we live together. It's about how institutions have an effect on individuals. Whether one is a cop, a longshoreman, a drug dealer, a politician, a judge or a lawyer, all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution to which they are committed.&#34;	5.0	Intelligent police style show. good acting, action and intriguing story line.	2014-06-28	1	1	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2E1EFNIZL2FVA	&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;	The Wire is an excellent show, great casting, interesting storylines, good scripts, and certainly different from the regular tv cop shows.However, if you are NOT ONE to be committed to EACH episode, faithfully, with dedication to script, observant, with keen awareness, willingness to re-watch for better clarity to plot and characters, you might not wish to begin the series.  The storylines are very complex, and if you don't understand all, you tend to miss important details.  You must also have some awareness for corruption in the system, and some insight into the operations of the drug world.The drama doesn't solve itself each week, it continues, in other words, the bad guy isn't always caught or neither is the murder of the day solved in 60 minutes, neither are there happy endings at season's end.  Storylines are not cut and dried for the viewer to understand, you must work at each show, work to understand what is going on, as there are many characters in the police force, the justice system, and of course the streets where the drug world plays out.  Actors in The Wire tend to mumble a lot, so it is imperative that you pay close attention, as names and associations are not clearly identified.The first season focuses on the drug gang of the streets of Baltimore, where murders, witnesses, money, corrupt politicians, failed justice system, and drugs are a way of life.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A7IRR3TLZK2C5	ac	I know calling it the best show ever made sounds cheesy, but it is at least the best show made in my lifetime. There are plenty of other entertaining shows available, but nothing that might make you rethink your worldview the way The Wire does. Season 1 starts slow, as it is responsible for introducing an incredibly deep cast of characters; however, you will be hooked after three or four episodes.I recommend this show to everyone, but many people are hesitant and assume it is just another crime drama. Part of the problem in convincing people to watch it is that it is too deep to quickly explain all its strong points. Give it a shot and you won't be dissapointed.	5.0	maybe the best show ever made	2006-12-25	3	3	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8	Adam	"I have long thought that some of the best stuff on TV can be found among HBO's Original Series.  I'm a big fan of some of HBO's better known dramas including Rome and The Sopranos, as well as of some lighter fare such as The Ali G Show and Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Strangely, I'd barely even heard of The Wire until very recently, when a friend of mine (who generally has very good taste) was raving about it.  Up until then, I hadn't given The Wire a chance, which was a mistake.  At his suggestion, I purchased Season One on DVD.I won't waste much time going into what The Wire is about, as that info can be found elsewhere.  For those who don't know, it's about an under-funded, under-manned, rag-tag group of police officers going after a fairly sophisticated, deep-pocketed, and well connected network of murderous drug dealers in West Baltimore.  While this general theme (underdog cops vs. powerful criminal organization) might not sound all that original, the series is extremely well executed.This is likely not an original opinion, but I think what really sets The Wire apart is its realism.  Granted, I'm an upper middle class nerd who's lived a coddled life, so I may not be the best qualified reviewer to comment on the realism of a show about drug dealers in the West Baltimore projects, but to me it achieves realism in a way that many if not most television (as well as big screen) dramas fail.  It isn't over dramatized.  The cops look and generally act like cops (they don't look like models and they live in crappy apartments, for example).  The ""bad guys"", similarly, look and act like rational participants in ""the game"" would be expected to.  The character development is excellent, and as a viewer I related to (even rooted for) characters on both sides - in fact there are both protagonists and antagonists on both sides.The Series does begin a little bit slow, but this is necessary in my opinion due to its complexity, so be sure not to write it off too early.  I'd guess that, had I been forced to rate The Wire after say, 3 episodes, I would have awarded it about 3 stars.  After 6 episodes, 4 stars.  But around episode 8 or 9 or so, the intensity really builds up and the plot lines start to unfold FAST.  It's well worth the time invested in the first, slower half of the season, in my opinion.I'd consider The Wire one of the best dramas in recent memory, and I'd definitely recommend buying, renting, or borrowing the Season One DVDs.  I would note though that, due to the general complexity of the Series, it's likely you'll want to go back and watch some (or all) episodes more than once, so the DVDs are worth purchasing in my opinion.As for the ultimate endorsement, will I be continuing the Series?  You bet, I'll be ordering Season 2 on Amazon soon after I submit this review."	5.0	Excellent Dramatic Television	2007-03-29	13	13	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AHL35XZ3OND2Z	Adron Gardner	"The Wire typifies ""slow boil.""  Early on you wonder what the heck is this thing? But it sneaks up on you, and weaves its tale in a way few other ""dramas"" on TV can.There were similiar shows on TV, in the mold of carefully setting up its characters slowly.  These shows went by the names of LOST and the Sopranos.  The main differences here aren't that one took place on an island or in restaurants and the other on the streets.  The main difference, is The Wire knew what the heck it was doing.Screw cop shows and CSI reruns.  Invest your time here.  Season 1 is just the beginning."	5.0	"""Cheese puffs AND f***** ring dings?"""	2011-03-28	2	2	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2RW9MR92QC63N	A Fan	"You are willing to invest 13 hours in a richly-textured, beautifully-cast and acted drama.  Do not mistake this for a typical crime show.  You can't just pop in the disc and expect entertainment without investing your full attention.  This has the depth and detail of a well-written novel and I find myself watching each episode multiple times to absorb the nuance of the storytelling.  I cannot praise this show enough.  David Simon has amde a commitment to not dumbing-down his content, but it's a two-way street and you can't expect to catch little snippets of the show and understand what's going on.  However, some of those little snippets are worth the price of admission themselves.  Also fun to watch considering that two of the leads, Dominic West and Idris Elba are Brits, but they speak Bawlmer-style without a hitch.  I have loved the Sopranos from the very first episode, but ""The Wire"" may well be the best television ever."	5.0	DO NOT buy this set unless...	2004-10-15	266	243	23

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AU1K6YRYZ4VMG	AJ	I am really picky and critical about what I watch, but I consider The Wire Season 1 to be a masterpiece. To give you an idea of my tastes, one of my favorite movies is Insomnia with Al Pacino. This show is even better than that, and you get to enjoy it for a whole season, not just 2 hours!Everything rings true. The dialogue, the plot--everything. The plot and dialogue remind me of the movie Crash at times, only this is less over-the-top.  It has lots of philosophical symbolism, but unlike Crash it  is presented subtly rather than by beating you over the head with it.The suspenseful moments are the most suspenseful I've seen in anything on screen.  Because it is a serial, there is time for a complex plot and complex characters to be developed. You get to hear the bona fide dialect spoken by many African-Americans in the DC-Baltimore area where I live, and the vocabulary is not dumbed down for a general audience as you would find in most movies. You get the real thing.Lastly, the director does something I wish more directors would do: he dispenses with music for the most part. Many directors use music as a crutch for making the audience feel the emotions they are supposed to feel in a particular scene. Here, the emotional reactions are induced by good acting alone, and it works. Watch this show. You won't regret it.	5.0	A masterpiece	2007-04-02	8	8	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	ASXW7UQXGMNJL	"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author"""	"After years of putting it off, I finally rented the first season of ""The Wire"" and after one episode I was hooked.As a reporter for Reuters who wrote a book about the U.S. prison systemGates of Injustice: The Crisis in America's Prisons (Prentice Hall Paperback)I spent a lot of time in Baltimore's meaner streets and I can testify that this series is totally realistic and convincing.Beyond that, what impressed me most is the nuanced, adult approach the writers take to their characters. No-one is perfect and few are perfectly evil. For instance, we first see D'Angelo, one of the central characters, on trial for a murder he plainly committed. Later, he confesses to killing another innocent person. But D'Angelo has a heart and a conscience.On the police side, we see one cop commit an act of wanton brutality. He is depicted as more than a little stupid. But later he is revealed to have a talent breaking codes and figuring out complicated paper trails.The ""hero"" is a dedicated detective but a poor husband and father, an occasional drunk and terrible son of a bitch.One enduring theme is the way drug money corrupts all who touch it -- not just the poor users but also the dealers, the police, lawyers and politicians. Drug money greases the skids of society in this series.I can't wait for the next four seasons."	5.0	Superb drama, compelling characters, utterly realistic	2009-01-07	1	1	0

I followed pretty well although missing part of the street lingo.  Not advised to be viewed just before bedtime.  Great acting, editing, continuity--all of that good stuff.  The second season moved slowly so I skipped a couple of episodes and then gave up completing it.  One does get the picture of what a nightmare it is to live in drug communities.  I kept wondering why some of the good guy victims just didn't hop a freight train to Utah.  I guess people don't like to leave what they know, even if it is like living in hell.	4.0	Find Your Ebonics Dictionary	2014-06-09	0	0	0

Remembering, though, that my eye is extremely demanding and specific, my ambivalence toward &#34;The Wire&#34; is not the asis for others' opinions.

My favorite movies are &#34;The Usual Suspects,&#34; &#34;The Proposal,&#34; &#34;Nobody's Fool,&#34; &#34;The Sting.&#34; All of these have strong character development, veer away from the formula of high concept filmmaking.	4.0	interesting	2014-06-11	1	0	1
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1NJ558HAU8IJ6	"A. Lynch ""The Magic Dragon"""	The Wire was described as being a visual novel by its creators. The idea was to create a slow, sprawling canvas of a show, one that requires, and rewards, devout attention. These goals were certainly accomplished with this, the first season of what is quickly gaining a reputation as one of the best shows to ever grace television.It's startlingly gripping, considering how slowly it moves. The dialogue is natural, and everything progresses naturally. It's an amazing, amazing show, and you're cheating yourself of a great experience. It rewards loyalty and patience, attention and intelligence. These are qualities far too rare in television today.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1JNAMN3RQNMCQ	"Amazon Buyer ""Amazon Buyer"""	"This show obviously has a hidden agenda of depicting black people as the cause of all of our society's problems.  We all know that the jewish mafia actually controls all organized gangs and all secret societies.  But of course that is never depicted, because they also control the IRS, the banks, the Federal Reserve, our military, our secret government agencies like the CIA and the FBI, all major corporations, our judges, our police, our government, our media and our politicians.  It's the old ""blame the poor for the crimes of the rich"" bate and switch trick.The problem with the jewish mafia is that they are fulfilling the needs of individuals that make up less than one percent of the population and they are taking 80 percent of the resources of the collective to do it.Everyone who joins a secret group takes a blood oath to keep the secrets secret.  In other words, if they tell the secrets of the group or go against anyone else in their group, they will be killed, their family will be killed and their friends will be killed.The jewish mafia has been controlling the world since they invented money 5000 years ago.  Money was invented to enslave people without having to use guards.  In other words, every time we use money we are willing slaves.  And the only reason they have been getting away with it is because they keep everything secret.  As long as people join these secret groups, they will remain in control.  The more of us who tell the truth, the less power they will have.They need people like me who tell the truth because deep down inside they want to be held accountable for the crimes they are committing against humanity before they die.  No one wants to be so out of balance that they harm a lot of people.  And that is exactly what the jewish mafia is doing.  And they do it in the name of the mainstream.It is sad that so many people believe what they see in the movies and on T.V.There is justice in the universe and these jewish mafia members, and the members of the secret groups they control throughout the world are held accountable for their actions after they die when they judge themselves during their life reviews.  After they die they have to feel the ripple effect of all the pain they have caused the world.  I don't envy them. A lot of the time they avoid death because they are avoiding having to face the consequences of their actions.For example, Dick Cheney, one of the most evil men that has ever walked this planet, just got a heart transplant in his 70's.  No one gets a heart transplant in their 70's but Dick Cheney did, because he is trying to avoid death.  In other words, he is trying to avoid facing the consequences of his actions.  Can you imagine what Dick Cheney is going to experience after he dies during his life review?  He is going to have to feel the pain of millions of people that he harmed directly as well as the millions that he has indirectly harmed as well.I feel sorry for them for being such lost souls.The universe seeks balance more than anything else.  These people are way out of balance.  It is in their best interest as well as our own that we stop them before they completely destroy this planet.Everything has a purpose.  The universe is full of opposites.  Good and evil are opposites.  Evil serves as much of a purpose as goodness does.  In other words, evil is just as valuable as goodness.  Evil is designed to ensure that we fulfill our individual needs, while goodness is designed to fulfill the needs of the collective.  When there is balance between good and evil, we fulfill the needs of the individuals as much as we do the needs of the collective.When less than one percent of the population controls eighty percent of the collective's resources, we have a problem.  That means that the variety of roles that we can play here on earth are limited to only a few.  The more balanced the needs of the collective are with the needs of individuals, the more roles we can play and the variety of roles we can play.  Life is much more interesting when it is balanced than when it is imbalanced.There are many ambassadors like me who have been sent to earth directly from God to spread this message.  The part that most humans don't understand is that God is controlling everything.  In other words, the jewish mafia really isn't in control of anything, only God is in control.  And God likes to create imbalances to make life interesting and then loves to bring things back in to balance again.  That is where we are at right now.  God is in the midst of restoring balance to humans on earth.  If you want to cooperate with God, then tell the truth about what money is really designed to do.In less than 100 years money will no longer exist on this planet and will never be allowed again on this planet again because of the harm that it causes.  There is a better way to fulfill the needs of the individuals than to use money.  God is in the process of creating 1000 years of balance on this planet.  That is what we have to look forward to.  If you want to be part of the restoration of balance on the planet, focus on being ok with the opposites that exist in the world.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A20D6TFY3O6UQ4	Amazon Customer	I loved this show, probably one of the best cop dramas ever. We watched all five seasons and I was so sad when there were no more.I looked forward to sitting and watching at least one episode a night. This is best viewed if you can watch without having to take more than two or three days between episodes (you won't want to anyway) as the story is complex.A good book to read if you would like some insight into the writers is &#34;Difficult Men&#34; by Brett Martin.	5.0	The Wire	2013-11-20	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AZ1MNRUSHHTKA	Amazon Customer	It's no wonder this series hasn't caught a massive audience. It's intelligent, it doesn't depend on cheap theatrics and easy hooks, it asks viewers to think for themselves, it refuses to run clich&eacute;s and stereotypes, its characters are often amoral or ethically flip-flop just like real people, it doesn't hand over the story in neat little bites, it relies on small beats of emotion to redirect the narrative arcs and it absolutely will not make any allowances if you miss something important. When you add the methodical attention to detail in police work, the unfiltered slang used by the gangs, the unremitting bad language, the use of drugs and the occasional splashes of genuinely unpleasant violence it really is a winner. Oh yeah, and it takes its time and goes really slowly as well.If reading the above you think it's a description of TV hell then goodbye. Don't let the door bump your backside on the way out. On the other hand if it rings any bells with you, then you have to got to watch this. The closest thing I can compare it to is...nothing else. There's never been anything quite like it. I read someone else here use the word genius and I think it is. It's a novel written for TV.A word of warning, though. I was in episodes 5-7 before I started loving it. Up until then it was appreciation then it all clicked into place and I went back and played the whole thing from the start.Also the 2nd and 3rd seasons are even better but you need to begin with season 1.	5.0	Listen Carefully	2007-06-24	5	5	0

It doesn't want to entertain. It wants you to think of what our cities have become and what each and everyone of us could or should do to prevent it from getting worse.The first set is about a drug-related murder case in Baltimore in which the police, while trying to solve it, discover a huge web of corruption and greed that goes right up to the top.It's not about black and white, good cops, bad gangsters, it's about what's behind the characters, what's driving them and how they got to be the way they are.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AFSPT0CJLA6ZX	Anthony Serino	A bit slow, but definitely worth hanging on for a while.  If you aren't interested after episodes 4 or 5, you probably might want to pass (though my favorite episodes were the latter of the series).  The writing is very well done, though there is a lot of profanity and vulgar language which bothers some people (most of the 1-star reviews are from the elderly and/or the bible-thumpers whining about the cursing). It is an interesting way to tell a story, from the traditional &#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad&#34; sides, showing how the line of good and evil is actually blurred, rather than focusing on the cops and allowing them to win every time).  Unlike a lot of other crime shows, this follows one story line throughout the 13 episodes, unlike most TV police dramas which have entirely new plots every episode.  This can make the story very slow at times so ignore the people telling you this is &#34;fast-paced,&#34; they have read too many review snippets and think it just means &#34;good.&#34; It is definitely good however, worth the 13 hours.  Finally, it helps if you can understand a lot of street and cop lingo, and if you are willing to re-watch parts that were confusing, the story does get complex at times with numerous different characters going all at once and a lot of call-backs to earlier episodes.4 stars instead of 5 because although it is excellent, it is a little slow and contains some gratuitous HBO sex and violence. GHBOS+V is the stuff that you know they are throwing in solely because marketing tells them they require X boob shots and Y severed limbs. If I wanted sex and violence, I'd watch porn and play video games.	4.0	slow but gripping in the end.	2014-07-02	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A29Y34ALWJUGB5	"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment"""	"Television today is polluted with cop shows, whether they are reality ones of the same name, or one of the many spin-offs of Law and Order or CSI, only with specific twists that attempt to make the series unique. Problem is, there are at least three spin-offs of each of these series, so uniqueness is obviously no longer there.That's where The Wire comes in. This show has elements of all of the shows above but actually does it with a sense of reality that only HBO can achieve. Cops swear, and drug-dealers talk in slang. These things you just don't here on regular TV because of censorship. Not only that, but HBO has a gift for creating huge casts to cover all aspects of a certain story without bogging down the flow of the story or becoming confusing (see Oz and Deadwood). The story in The Wire follows a group of hastily brought together police officers, detectives, and undercover agents as they attempt to bring down Baltimore's biggest drug kingpin using wire taps and hidden cameras. On the opposite side of this fight, the drug dealers range every where from the simple messenger to the leader himself. Then, there are the inbetweeners, such as the ""Robbin Hood"" who robs from drugs from the dealers and sells it to other dealers to gain favors, the dopers, the kids surrounded by this mess, and the women of the dealers. When brought together, it makes a cast of characters too many to count, but by the end of this season, it's easy to distinguish each and every character.Another great thing about this series is the realism. Anyone who lives in a neighborhood where drugs prevail will feel a pang when watching this show. Cops can be corrupt and cops can be good-guys, while the drug dealers can be the same way, bad or good. What distinguishes them is the choices they made or were forced to make in their pasts, and the side of the law they are on when they break the law. Those who live around this know this well, and will find the realism of The Wire stark indeed.I can't recommend The Wire highly enough. It easily the best cop drama on TV, and if HBO didn't have so many other great shows appearing on DVD and on their channel, I'd say that it may well be the best show on TV. Either way, it's damn close. Get this if you loved The Wire when you first watched it on TV, or if you just want to see something different. Chances are, you'll sit down and want to watch the whole thing because of how addictive it is."	5.0	Fiction in a Nonfiction World	2006-02-20	7	7	0

Cops v cops, dealers v dealers. everybody getting squeezed from those on top and those on the bottom. No honor among thieves, as everyone knows, But by watching this series I found out that there's no honor among anybody.Which is definitely bleak.However, at the series finale, when our idealistic, street-smart hero gets his comeuppance from higher-ups, it's not tragic, but it feels like a splash in the face with a bucket of cold water. He still has a job in law enforcement, but it's not in the department he wanted..And despite his herculean effort, the drug trade continues apace, with hardly a hitch.	5.0	The Wire-A Profiie in Futility	2013-11-19	2	1	1

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AGXO0AH7D1284	A. Terry	Most of the actors in this series are relatively unknown, but are fine at their craft.  The characters are believable and textured.  The plots give the average American a glimpse into challenges that law enforcement officers face, and real issues that exist in the day to day life of people in drug infested neighborhoods.  This is an intense drama that keeps you engaged from the opening scene to the final episode of season one.  The characters who portray Stringer Bell, and Detective McNulty are British actors, and you would never know it.

The characters are brilliant, the plot is so clever and I love the fact you start up wanting the police to win and then end up wanting Barksdale to win. It is so well written.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A15ORE5WVKH58E	"Avon Barksdale ""Home of the Wire"""	I am disappointed that this show is entering its final season. This show was overshawdowed by the Sopranos and unrealistic yet entertaining police shows like The Shield. For those of you that think this is creative writing, think again, this is the real in depth view of cases that actually occurred. For those of you who have never ventured into an inner city with a drug and crime problem this show will put you in the drivers seat. One small thing, you will be safe from the realities that others live in daily that are depicted on The Wire. The next three seasons are just as great with the fourth being one of the most powerful ones. When that comes out, keep in mind that its not entertainment it's real life drama. Open your mind and try and help fix some of the real problems that go on. I'm looking forward to season 5.I'd like to give this show more than 5 stars. Thumbs way up.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1CQGAPQMN41LV	"A. Whitehead ""Werthead"""	The Wire is, at first glance, Yet Another Cop Show, about a group of disparate and conflicted police officers working to bring down criminals who are often not much better than they are. Yawn. However, there are two things that mean that people should take this seriously. Firstly, it's made by HBO who, up to a couple of years ago anyway, seemed physically incapable of making something unless it was absolutely gripping and awesome. Secondly, it's the creation of former police writer and journalist David Simon, whose previous show was the brilliant Homicide: Life on the Street.The Wire kicks off on the mean streets of Baltimore, Maryland. A murder case against a young black man named D'Angelo Barksdale collapses when one of the witnesses is scared into retracting her testimony. The furious judge learns from homicide detective Jimmy McNulty that D'Angelo is a junior member of a far-reaching criminal gang run by his cousin, the extremely elusive Avon Barksdale. This gang controls all the drug supplies on the west side of the city, and are protected by a labyrinth of legit front organisations. Determined to get some payback, the judge uses his influence to have a special joint homicide-narcotics unit formed to bring down the Barksdale gang, with McNulty assigned and an up-and-coming officer named Lt. Daniels placed in charge.The investigation into the Barksdale organisation by the unit forms the backbone of the first season of the show, but that's just one side of the story. We also get to see the investigation from the POV of the criminals themselves, most notably D'Angelo as he finds himself free but busted down to supplying the lowest of the estates, as well as the kids who work for him. A dangerous, unpredictable third faction is also in play in the form of the one-man army Omar Little, a criminal whose personal code means he can only steal from other criminals. The police try to form an alliance with Omar to bring down Barksdale, but their erstwhile ally has an unfortunate tendency to blow away the criminals they're trying to get locked up, which makes this a difficult task.The appeal of The Wire is hard to explain to those who haven't seen it. It's fairly slow-moving (although never dull) in places and arguably takes two or three episodes to really kick in. It's also pretty unforgiving if you miss an episode. Flashbacks to prior episodes are non-existent, and plot points and character and emotional arcs often turn on a single conversation from several episodes earlier. You need to pay attention here. Luckily, that's made easy by the tight writing, the ingenious methods the criminals go to avoid being caught and the even more intelligent methods the police need to use to investigate them, and the acting. It'd be almost impossible to single out any of the actors for praise. British actor Dominic West has the closest thing to a central role as McNulty, and handles the character very well, but Lance Reddick (more recently seen as the enigmatic Abbadon in Lost) holds every scene he's in as the formidable Lt. Daniels. Clarke Peters develops his character of Lester Freamon from almost a background role to that of the most intelligent and confident officer on the team in a natural and impressive manner. John Doman's constantly-infuriated performance as McNulty's commanding officer and eternal nemesis Major Rawls has to be mentioned as well.On the criminal side of things, British actor Idris Elba (formerly seen as Vaughn in the excellent Ultraviolet) impresses as Stringer Bell, Avon Barksdale's trusted number-two man, and Larry Gilliard Jr. provides the main criminal POV as 'D' Barksdale, as he tries to claw his way back up the organisation amidst growing concerns about how the family does business. For most people - including Barak Obama - the stand-out performances in the show belong to two of the more morally ambiguous characters, namely Michael K. Williams as the dangerously unpredictable Omar and Andre Royo as 'Bubs', a street informant struggling with his own drug addiction. Royo's performance was so convincing that whilst filming he was offered a heroin fix by a passer-by who thought he badly needed it, and later referred to this as his 'street Oscar'.The cast is uniformally brilliant, the writing is fantastic and the show is, surprisingly, very funny. Whether it's the stories of some mind-bogglingly stupid criminals, or the ridiculous difficulties the team faces at getting a desk into their basement office, or Bubs' methods of identifying suspects for the police observers, the show has a jet-black vein of comedy which gives several laughs per episode. This is necessary because the show can be quite bleak, showing as it does wasted young lives amidst the crumbling tenements of a poor city, and a lot of the characters die in rather unpleasant ways over the course of the investigation. The investigation also ends messily, and the fates of many of the characters is left wide open for the second season.The Wire: Season 1 (*****) takes a couple of episodes to build up a head of steam and get you into its headspace, but once that's done it never lets go.	5.0	Flawlessly enjoyable	2008-10-08	6	6	0

Season three, starting now (Fall 2004), looks like the overall excellence will be sustained. Enjoy skilled acting, compelling drama, dialogue with humor and cultural references both overt and obscure? Can you handle complex stories that have depth and human understanding? Did you appreciate CBS' ""Wiseguy"" for the landmark groundbreaking show it was and do you regret the aforementioned network's (mis-)handling and subsequent cancellations of Falcone or Easy Street? If your answer is yes, fine, but do not expect a disguised retread. Kind of a complex elaboration on HBO mini-series ""The Corner""'s story lines, this one stands well on its own, and truth be told, lives above the  tree line of the (richly deseerved) television gold-standard ""The Sopranos."""	5.0	believe every other five star testimonial	2004-09-28	9	9	0

You are undoubtedly seeing all these rave reviews and wondering is this real?  Is this some snobby critics scam to make it so classics along the lines of  Hangin With Mr. Cooper will be looked down upon?  Wonder no more. The Wire is amazing. A group of friends and I were talking about what we are watching.  I was the only one who had watched the Wire at that time.The question came up &#34;If you only had a month to live, and you were bedridden, awake and alone for 40 hours what show would you binge watch.&#34;  My answer is simple, Sister Wives, because it would seem like the month lasted 20 years and I would feel like I cheated death.  Back to the Wire, though.  There is a lot of debate about whether this is the Golden Age of TV. I think it is, the Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Justified, Mad Men, Kurt Sutter retelling Hamlet from the viewpoint of a motorcycle gang in Sons Of Anarchy.  The Shield.  Treme. Fargo. If you believe this is the golden age of television, then consider the Wire the Gold Standard of the Golden Age.I don't know how many people have seen the Wire.  Probably less than tuned into this week's episode of the Bachelorette.  Even fewer have seen the entire Series. ( Quick Take_ Many slag off Season Two Of the Wire. Ignore them.  It may be out of context but when  you view it for what it is it may be the best season, not the worst. ) Many people who have watched the entire Wire series act as though they are part of a special club having watched the Wire.  Although they are morons they are right.  Those who have watched the entire Wire series have seen the best television show in history.I still feel sad for Baltimore.	5.0	Ok, So You Are Wondering About the Wire	2014-06-04	1	1	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A30PAUKSXQTN8P	Bob Rousseau	"I am not prone to exaggeration when it comes to talking about films and television because I've seen a lot of excellant work in my life (television especially has improved a great deal), but I firmly believe that it would be nearly impossible to make a better television series than ""The Wire"". I never thought it would be possible to top ""Homicide: Life on the Streets"", but ""The Wire"" has done that in spades in my book. In part it's because David Simon learned a great deal from observing ""Homicide""'s adaptation to television and he's gotten better at his craft (the HBO miniseries ""The Corner"" he wrote after ""Homicide"" is also excellant, and a few actors that later appeared on ""The Wire"" debuted in that series).But beyond that, unlike when ""Homicide"" was on NBC with all of its attendant prime time restraints, ""The Wire"" is an HBO production, which allowed for much more realism (it's ridiculous to depict drug dealers saying nothing harsher than ""fudge"", as is the case on network crime shows) and at the same time, less pressure to 'throw in a steamy love story' or one of those other network conventions.  It does make one wonder how much better ""Homicide"" might've been had it been a HBO series back in the day.It was obvious by the first episode of ""The Wire"" that it had the same great qualities of ""Homicide"", and it was even richer. I thought after the first season of ""The Wire"" that it was inevitable that the second would disappoint, as was the case with ""The Sopranos"" and ""Six Feet Under"" on HBO (two series that have primarily disintergrated into adult soap operas), but amazingly, ""The Wire"" got even better in its second season. Now, with the additional writers Simon has enlisted to help on The Wire's third season (including Dennis LaHane, author of Mystic River), added to the already impressive Richard Price (author of Clockers), it seems likely that the show is just going to get better. Hopefully the Emmys people will finally take notice (though, as David Simon said recently, he already knew from ""Homicide"" that the best way to get ignored in the television world is to film a show in Baltimore).It sounds like the Wire DVDs will have some great extras- which are much appreciated, since the DVDs of David Simon's also excellant ""The Corner"" didn't have any."	5.0	BETTER than Homicide, Sopranos, or you name it!	2004-09-14	10	10	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A32KPDQ2JT3ANM	Booker	"New friendships, new acquaintances... just a simple mention ""so, what do you honestly think of The Wire?"" illicits only one of three responses: I love it, I hate it, I haven't seen it. Responses like ""it's boring"" or ""too realistic"" ride under the ""I hate it"" response. If someone says ""I love it"" my affinity for that persons intelligence and personal sense of their place in a diverse and yet mostly unknowable world grows exponentially. ""I hate it"" pegs their life-outlook in the CSI, Law & Order et al mode. Quintessentially myopic in just about every sense of the word. ""I haven't seen it"" immediately brings out the Santa Claus in me as I hand them over my copy for them to ingest, digest, and ultimately get back to me with a measured response. If they come back with the ""I hated it"" they're probably not worth my time. On the other hand, I just got my wife to finally watch the show; she hates those ""f***, f***, f*** n' f***"" shows (as she likes to call them), it took her five episodes to begin to understand what this new beast was. We watched, I saw the light of reality start to dawn on her on just what this was... nothing short of Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"", a bit of Hugo's ""Les Miserables"", Dicken's ""Oliver"" - all of which are stunning comments on not only crime, but poverty, and the role that the everyday citizen who turns a blind eye and does not demand accountability from it public service officials plays in the further decline of our society.Now, I love shows like Rome, I can enjoy the happy romp of BBC's Jekyll, Babylon 5, although sorely lacking in most departments, tells a mythic story, The Sopranos was devious tv that was just damn fun to watch, Six Feet Under showcased that comedy could come from anywhere, but The Wire is something altogether different. It dares to point the finger, it dares to show life in all of its brilliance and all of its ugliness, it dares you as a viewer to actively think about the issues presented while still maintaining a storytellers eye, and it dares you, as a viewer, witness just how good tv can be if its creators have the unrestrained balls to give rise to their finer instincts."	5.0	Using this show as a benchmark for...	2007-12-13	6	5	1

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3SGXOOPYWSEPX	brendanstallard	I write as a retired police officer from the UK, who has now escaped to Atlanta. The Wire clearly expresses the soul wearying difficulties of policing rules where different interests control from different political perspectives. Without doubt, those are different in the UK, but some of the same aggravations, lack of resources, clear direction and judicial wariness are present. As it is on prime, I have been binge watching-for me, that's one show a night, and for me it leaves the impression that the whole of Baltimore City and perhaps all of America's cities are as portrayed in The Wire-which is depressing.The show is a class act. Well written, acted and directed, just leaves *me* on a bit of a downer. I like a little slush in my pie:) Excellent stuff.brendan	4.0	Excellent, but somewhat depressing	2014-06-15	1	1	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A19HBE17E7T045	Brian A.	After scrolling through a couple pages of reviews on the show, there are some points that need to be reinforced. While most of the reviews are positive and praise David Simon's writing, there are some that don't grasp what the show is trying to accomplish. This is not another NCIS, Law and Order, or Castle-type show. There is no tidy end to each episode where the protagonists succeed and the criminals caught. It is a linear show that tells a complex story and attempts to depict a particular way of life in Baltimore -- this is what makes it so unique and intriguing. There is no cheesy, cliche dialogue amongst characters like in more mainstream crime dramas, instead there is more authentic dialouge with slang from street characters, police jargon from law enforcement, etc.The Wire also doesn't pull any punches when it portrays life for Baltimore's lower class. While some may view the depiction as overly bleak and pessimistic, the show prides itself on delving deeply into some of the most concerning social issues facing the city: drugs, politics, education, labor, and journalism. If the show did not create a feeling of despair for its viewers, the issues wouldn't be able to be taken seriously by the audience. Only by fully revealing the negative aspects of life can the show develop a sense of legitimacy and impart real understanding to viewers.	5.0	Not Your Average Crime Drama	2013-01-28	1	1	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AVCA6CJCSUL17	Bryan Harding	Ok so I'm huge fan of HBO and their programing.  They have made so many shows that I love (Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Rome,etc).  So about year ago I saw season 1 of the Wire on special at my local circuit city.  I didn't know much about it at the time, but read what it was about and it sounded interesting and knowing my track record with HBO I figured I couldn't go wrong.  Man was I dissappointed I watched two episodes and was bored to tears.  So after the finishing the second episode I put the dvd back in the box and tossed under a chair where it's been for the last six months.  Anyway over the last six months I kept hearing how great the wire was blah blah, but chose to ignore it.  But finally a few day I decided what the hell I'll give it another go.  Man am I glad did.  This show is absolutely amazing once things moving.  Anyway I don't do reviews much but I decided to this just in case there is someone else like me who gave up after the first few episodes.  You need to go back and give this another look.  It is an absolutely amazing show!!!!	5.0	Amazing Show!!!	2008-02-09	1	1	0

What was surprising to me was the inexperience of some the actors. But those actors were able to hold their own and make the show. It's a Shame that this show never won any awards from the main stream. But the Wire has won the acclaim of the people which I believe matters. If anybody hasn't watched the Wire should just watch an episode and I promise you will be hooked on the show.	5.0	The Wire season 1	2014-06-22	0	0	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AR39EB6DA3ACO	B. Tenpenny	If you enjoy cop shows, police procedurals, etc, The Wire is pretty much the best of the best. Made for HBO, it's as gritty and real as it can be. There isn't really a &#34;whodunnit&#34; aspect to the show, since the show spends an equal amount of time on both sides of the law. An excellent balance of character development and story-telling, without turning into a soap opera. I've never been in the Baltimore PD, and I've never lived in the Baltimore projects, but I feel like I know them. Later seasons branch out into whole different areas, too! Spend some time with this series, and you won't be disappointed.	5.0	As many others have said, probably the crime drama show ever made.	2014-06-28	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1MMFSW19AM019	B. Wueste	Buying a television series on DVD is generally a wasted investment - once you watch the series rarely will you go back and watch it again. At best it would end up being a secret santa present or a rotating loan between friends and family. The Wire is different and actually worth the investment. The first season itself starts off a little slow, which is likely when everyone who rated this less than 5 stars stopped watching. The beauty of the show lies in the careful character development and the attention to detail. There are no extra characters who appear in one episode never to be seen again - even the seemingly least important background character will come up again later in the season and again in subsequent seasons. More importantly there are no filler episodes in the season - each one is important to the plot of the season, the overall plot of the series and to the development of major and minor characters.I wouldn't consider myself a tv junkie or a dedicated fan of crime dramas like Law & Order, but this series is simply too good to miss out on. Watching the season again, particularly after having watched the subsequent seasons, you gain an even greater appreciation for the character development and you pick up on a ton of details that didn't seem important the first time through.	5.0	Simply put - the best television series of all time	2011-02-25	2	2	0

Above & beyond the guilty pleasure of the wanton violence, The Wire offers an intelligent plot, although, at times, it can be a little difficult to follow; but, I think what I like most about The Wire is that it frequently (at least once an episode) makes me angry or uncomfortable. Whether it's a cop beating on a kid, or a kid strung out on dope, I'm continuously amazed at the moral dilemmas posed in each episode, on both sides of the badge.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A4X7FBQ5SKPI6	"Cathy J. Taurine ""C.J."""	"I know everyone will hate me when they read my review.  In fact, why would anyone listen to me when almost 92% of the hundreds who have reviewed this series give it five stars?  Well, just my opinion but here it is:What was expected was that when I started this series, beginning with season one, I was in for a spectacular viewing.  A detective drama set in Baltimore that mixed undercover work, court drama and various themes of humanity.  Does it have it?  Well, sometimes, but the delivery is done with ground shipping, and like the po-boys they try to show in the projects, I end up sitting around on a couch waiting...waiting......waiting for drama that never comes.  Waiting for action that is weak, and waiting to strain through the bog of endless office talk.  Perhaps it is in the office where the show falters the most, sometimes having camera shots zoom in on a person for three seconds at a time while they are thinking about nothing.  Then there is the whole thing with the detective using a typewriter.  Okay, did I miss something?  Is this 2008 or 1978 people??  High Profile crime unit using typewriters, sure I buy it and a bag of that counterfeit money they had in the first episode.I read where someone said the Wire was the Shield ""With brains"", well the intellect may be there but the likeable characters sure are not.  Not in twenty years have I seen a show that has such a weak character development.  The minor details they do try to add to give them some kind of personality, are ultimately just for nothing.  The bad guys are not bad, mean, or scary and the good guys are just plain boring.  Up that with a bunch more office talk where various stiffs wearing suits stand in dark corners trying to act like imposing forces.  Again, nothing there, these characters could be loafs of bread with bright red twisty ties and they would garner more attention.I'm so glad I just rented this season, I was planning on buying season 2 if I liked the first one, but this has to be one of the worst television dramas HBO has EVER done.  One other thing that adds to the NO ORIGINALTIY section of their accolades from me is the fact they seem to think it is necessary to drop 400 F-bombs every show.  For those of you who don't understand that, it means the F-word, and this show has them throwing it around like its DEADWOOD.  Then again, that show got cancelled after only three seasons.  When is HBO going to produce a drama that is fictional but still plausible, without stripping away every humanistic quality in the process?"	2.0	Flawed, slow and boring	2007-10-20	97	24	73

The series covers five different arcs, one each season, and each one is vital to understanding how Baltimore (&#34;Bodymore, Murderland&#34;) got into the state it is in.  Police, Unions, Teachers, Politicians, and Newspapers all play a part in the organism, each providing it's own pluses and minuses.  Nobody is alone, nobody is outside the system, they are all part of the game in one way or another (excepting OMAR).

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A7M2PR1AN8MQR	celeste	I had heard great things about The Wire and after watching the first episode, was hooked. The storytelling is so detailed and has all the elements you'd want in a show. The writer was a former cop and therefor had a wealth of knowledge to bring to the show for accurate details. This show leaves no stone unturned. I appreciate that it felt like i was watching something that was based on a true story. Every character was flawed in some way and were just trying to get by. In the finale, some people dies, some lived, some became addicts, some gangsters, some went to prison, cops were promoted and demoted (whether or not they deserved it). The endings felt very realistic. While I loved the whole series and recommend watching all four, my favorites are 1 & 2. I couldn't believe the last season aired in 2007. I though I was watching a new show, but the again, I don't have cable.	5.0	Probably the smartest show on television	2013-03-10	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1ZQV2TGIXVFXR	CFS	This show is about a police campaign against a gang of drug dealers in Baltimore. It's very realistic; I would have believed if I had been told the plot was based on a real story. The characters were completely believable, there were no cliches and no plot inconsistencies that I could detect. The production, writing, and acting were flawless. But I have a few problems with the concept behind this show. There is very little ambition besides being realistic and no creativity, no surprises; neither the characters nor the story were remarkable. Even ordinary people are interesting when you take the time to know them well and I really liked all the characters in this show, including the drug dealers. It was good human drama that made me laugh and cry, but I found it easy to forget them after I finished the last episode. The producers could have chosen any theme to make a realistic show about and surely real police work gets more interesting than this. In any case, observing complex characters is never boring and I'll probably watch the second season.	4.0	Realistic show	2007-09-15	1	0	1

Their shows are in a class of their own.  At times I wish I could only get HBO and forget the rest of the channels.  Well... I kind of got tired of the writing in Sopranos, luckily Deadwood provided me my fix.  That is until a friend of mine told me to check out ""The Wire"".  What? I vaguely recall seeing previews for it, but had never watched an episode.  But out of my respect of my friend and HBO dramas, I decided to give it a shot.  After 1 episode I was intrigued,  2 episodes I was hooked.  After finishing the first season, I was desperate to get my hands on as much of this show as possible.  There is nothing else like it on TV.  Like others have said, this is not a cop show.  The Wire is an unapologetic view of the entire food chain of the drug trade in inner city Baltimore.  Unlike the normal good cops, bad drug dealer stereotypes that portray so many other crime dramas, The Wire deals in grays.  It shows good and bad in all its characters on both sides of the fence.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2KGCK3Q4VARC8	Christopher Greffin	The first season of The Wire takes us through pararell stories of law enforcement and criminals in Baltimore surrounding a single murder/drug case. It unravells itself in a way some have compared to a novel, each episode being like a chapter, and this is litterally unlike anything I have ever seen from a television series, and it's just a joy to watch. It covers the investigation in such a detailed, muliviewed way that I felt if I was a part of the community. There aren't cliffhangers or satisfying hollywood conclusions at the end of most episodes, but I was eagarly awaiting every next episode because I was drawn into the story and characters and needed to see what will happen next. The cast from top to bottom is outstanding (no major stars, just character actors), and I won't bother trying to pick a few favorite performances as that would just be too difficult.The Wire is brutally honest in dealing with it's material, which may be a reason it hasn't gotten the recognition it deserves from the likes of the Emmys. People in law enforcement are human, and some are corrupted, while others bend the rules a little bit here and there when it's convienent. The police are not all these rightous crusaders like many television shows depict; in the end it's a job like anything else. It's not a bash on law enforcement at all though; in fact there are great moments of redeption for a few characters. On the criminal side it deals with shades of grey, some being just bad and others victims of their circumstance, but none are thrown under the train as being completey inhuman. The big enemy on the show seems to not be the cops, and not even the criminals, but the beauracracy and the highers ups with political motives that impedes justice.If you've never seen the show do yourself a favor and get this first season. Chances are you'll get hooked. I think it may be the finest example of television ever produced.	5.0	An amazing creation	2007-07-23	3	3	0

Gone is the unfallable courageous protagonist and or the evil super villain,  In thier place lie good guys who aren't always so good and bad guys who aren't always that bad.  This show is a masterpiece and should be treasured.  granted this show is not for everone.  the crime violence can be very graphic and if you just want to sit and watch a show without any thought or attention to detail than this is certainly not for you.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AFUL9B8GMK9ES	Click	"A TV show that unfolds like a good book , slowly and with many layers. This storyline has the feeling of reality like no other I have seen portrayed. It is NC-17 for the language , some violence and a little nudity so if you expect the ""soft"" stories of broadcast TV this may be too radical of a change. Barney Miller it ain't.Watching it each week on HBO was a joy , now that I have the DVDs a quick re-wind allows a chance to pick up a nuanced scene for details missed on a previous viewing. There are people and events that are revisited after more that a season , this rarely happens in a typical 1 hour serial show. We see good people who sometimes do bad things ... bad people who sometimes do good things and an image of a system (criminal/political/social) that is F.U.B.A.R. I can not recommend this highly enough. If the language and somewhat slow pace don't put you off there is a breadth and depth of story to absorb.Sometimes adding subtitles helps but don't expect too much from the Closed Captioning. The CC seems to have been done by a child and has many missing or misspelled words. The captioning errors are my only real complaint about the discs.As The Wire says ...

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AMAUDONEA4XPU	Consumer	The opening episode of the first season is the best hour of television ever to hit the airways.  It encompassed high drama, humor and wit, and plot twists as realistic and street wise as it gets.  And, the acting is just superb.  The balance of Season One is just as enthralling and constitutes the best of television, that to my mind has never been surpassed.  It received tremendous reviews at the time and that fortified my opinion when I was able to read them.  The balance of the series is superb as well; it's just that the bar was set so high by the first episode and the first season that nothing, no matter how they tried could ever equal the draw it had on viewers like me.  I recorded from the air at the time, but needed to have a professionally made copy to truly capture the ambience of the production.	5.0	Best One Hour of Television Ever	2013-09-18	1	1	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1C64FW4KMBEXP	Daniel Sturgeon	This is the greatest show I have ever watched on television. That is not hyperbole, it is fact. The thing is I do know people who did not like it and every time they told me it was slow and they only watched a couple of episodes.Here is the deal, when you watch this you need to1. Pay attention - a lot of stuff happens and all of the characters are fleshed out. There are no cliche characters here.2. Watch more than a couple of episodes - there is no payoff at the end of the first few episodes. The only payoffs in the series come at the end of the seasons. Everything prior is building up to the end of the season.3. Be prepared for grit - this is not some glossed over show like the ones you are used to on the networks. This is gritty and as real as possible. The extras in many cases are real people from Baltimore including cops and criminals. There will be bad language and there will be harsh realities. It is not a happy ending type show. The good guys do not always win, and you do not know who the good guys are all of the time. You will at times find yourself gaining a certain level of respect for drug dealers and rooting for a guy who sticks up drug dealers and sells the drugs himself.For anyone who hasn't seen this show or couldn't get through it...please take a look.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AHUJ0T9Q0VW02	Danny Pyle	Before I downloaded this season I was doubting The Wire would be any different from other shows of it's genre.  However, after the first few episodes I was hooked into the characters, and the plot, and I couldn't stop watching the show.  There were days that I would look at the clock and realize I have been watching the drama unfold for two, or more, hours straight, and still wanted to see what happens next.  The actors are all top notch, and the writing is superb.What I like best about this show is it is real.  The characters act like normal human beings, with all their virtues and all their flaws.  The reality that transpires is very random, which sets this show apart from the predictable shows.  The chain of command, the unwritten rules, the realistic city politics, the greed, the egos, the friendships, the sex, it all is down to earth, believable, and makes this drama interesting.	5.0	Raw and authentic	2014-06-02	1	1	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3JBATAVWWD9WY	Darrell Turner	The Wire is probably the best series I've ever watched. I recently purchased the series thinking that it may not be as good the second time around. On the contrary the series is just as good the second time as the first. Knowing the outcome does not diminish it's quality at all. This time around I am able to reflect more on the characters, events taking shape and the social setting.For those who may not know anything about The Wire; the series is about a Baltimore drug dealer and his partners and crew. A special police unit is formed to try and catch this drug dealer. It is not long before the inspiration of this unit, Detective McNulty realizes the only way they are going to catch this guy is to use wire taps. Once the wire taps are installed the unit begins to see how sophisticated this group of drug dealers are.The unit is in a constant battle with police brass for survival.. Politics, backstabbing and dirty deals take place on both sides of the fence. Ethics, rights, morality and law are all gobbled up by the pervasive need to survive.This series is a must see for anyone interested social policy, politics and just plain old good entertainment.	5.0	The Best!	2013-01-26	0	0	0

However, it is all worth the effort.One great thing about this show is that every scene whether you are in the ghetto, cop station, or the official of the local politician all feel very real.

This show will take you into the lives of its compelling, well written characters, where you will experience the range of emotions from hope, frustration, guilt, anger, sadness, and everything in between.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1FF2KROA1D87	Denise P	One of the best series on TV. Runs at least neck and neck, I think better then the Sopranos.The characters are fascinating and complex. Some of the best story telling and acting I've seen in a long time. The characters personalities are compelling and captivating. You just get hooked.I was a Soprano's snob. I just felt it was the best thing on TV and safely tucked away in Jersey so I didn't have to think about the crimes affecting my life.Before I viewed The Wire, I guess I didn't want to be bothered with the whole urban crime thing, especially so close to home. I felt like what on earth could these kids, with pants hanging down to there knees and rap music blasting have to say that's intelligent?I found that the crime hierarchy is so much like the Sopranos, organized to the point of being genius. I found just like the Sopranos there is a Family like element, but a brutality that is unbelievable.There are characters you will love but know they are paid to kill. Characters you find ultimately ruthless almost with animal cunning. Then you will find some characters eloquent in there lifestyle and speech.Among the characters in Season One, a young dealer who lives in a condemned building with about 6 little elementary school kids. He buys food for them and sends them off to school. He's lost with no parents like those kids. The show isn't preachy in any way. It just is.Also The Wire is about both sides of the coin. The police officers, politics, and lifestyles are just as riveting. Cops that drink too much, have an awful family life, fighting with ex's, or not giving a damn.It's outstanding.......I think it's not as popular as the Sopranos because there aren't a lot of big time stars in it although there are local actors and cameos by some well known artists.Please take a look at this outstanding series; you'll be glad you did.	5.0	The Wire First Season is outstanding  just like 2 and 3	2007-03-08	5	5	0

The acting is GREAT from the key actors. A couple of the goofy idiot cops should have been replaced. But the directing and the writing are WAY OFF. This show would really appeal gangbangers n ppl like dat. Eg.The show has a curtain lingo, if you arnt 'in the life' you probably wont get alot of whats goin on. The writers have written it in away that details of the show that are supposed to be obvious can easily be over looked.This show goes for 1 hr on its own, on dvd. no shows do that. this may be an issue with getting a time-slot. I bought this on special for $15 au. Which is about $10 US atm. No way would i pay $60 US, for a 13 episode show. ha	3.0	Dont trust the reviews. They arnt always reliable	2009-02-16	36	3	33

Despite the hype, and all the trendies saying what a mahhvellous show it is, actually it is pretty dull.  Boring characters, little conflict, confusing scripts, same stuff repeated ad nauseam.  Frankly, the lives of petty drug dealers in Baltimore don't do it for me, and not do the cops who are a pretty unattractive bunch with few dramatic qualities.  I know that Prison Break was appallingly acted but at least it had a story line.  The Wire is like an improvisation at one of those let it all hang out stage schools which never produces particularly great actors.	1.0	extremely dull show	2009-04-19	173	29	144

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A14UE5T8VAQNA1	Douglas Bridges	The third season is beginning on HBO, and it looks like The Wire is going to continue to be the best show on Television.  I watched the first episode of the first season, and I was not a big fan of The Wire.  There were too many characters and the street lingo was very hard for me to understand.  However, there was something about it that made me want to see if it would get better.  Even though there are many characters, every one of them is developed so thoroughly and skillfully that you identify with each and everyone of them. The more you watch, the better you get at understanding the lingo used by everyone.As a warning to people who have not watched The Wire.  It can be quite violent and the language can be very harsh.  Also, you will get very attached to some of the characters, and things do not always end pleasantly.  However, there has not been any better acting or writing (except the second season of The Wire, which was even better).	5.0	Easily the best show on Television	2004-09-20	9	9	0

No more McNulty, Bunk, Prop Joe, Bubbles and, yes, even Marlo. After five seasons I feel like I know these people.Other reviewers have commented eloquently on how good this show is. I guess I'll just add that if you're into multi-character shows with long plot arcs, like Lost or Battlestar: Galactica, take a step up and try Season 1 of The Wire. I love those shows, but The Wire is in a different league. You have to be willing to pay attention and invest the time as the multiple, intertwined plots and realistic characterizations unfold, and you won't be spoon-fed a shocking plot twist and/or cliffhanger each week. But you will not see a better television show.	5.0	I'll say it too: the best show on television	2008-03-11	1	1	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1AP0OUIDWW9A8	Dr H.Alloy	'The Wire' unfolds like the best kind of novel, full of detail, nuance and memorable characters. And yet it's not a police show. It's an urban tragedy. A heartbreaking commentary on the neglected, marginalised and ignored in American cities. It's about the have's and have not's and the sheer devastation wrought by poverty and drugs.But it's still a slam bang, unabashedly violent cops and robbers saga, chocka block with intricate plot twists, shocking, often very bloody deaths and some suprising humour.Set in Baltimore, 'The Wire' show sets up all the cliches of a police drama and then blows them apart with brilliant scripts and a magnifcent ensemble cast that give a richness and empathy not usually seen in this type of show. The actors are simply wonderful.The sense of gritty reality, time and place simply adds to the tragedy.	5.0	ONE OF TV'S BEST SHOWS EVER	2008-09-03	0	0	0

But nobody was gonna step up, and say it, so why not me.  Okay, I didn't read every last one of the 96 reviews, but I'm sure not everyone can compare the two, like me.I tried the Sopranos, and was not throughly impressed.  But, as somebody else said, this is like a detailed novel, with all the nuances of sight, sound and clarity.  It's like a visual smack in the face from every direction.Nobody lays off in this series.  Nobody.  Not the criminal, the street cop, or the sophisticated detective.  Everyone has an angle, and every one is bucking for a promotion, from the street hood, to the tenured Police Litenuit.  It's a dog eat dog world, and nobody is going home hungry, or so it seems.Call it what you want.  I call it brilliant television, you may call it HBO?Complaints:  Too much cursing.  Okay, we get it already, It's HBO, you can curse with four letter words.  No censors.  We get it!  Doesn't mean I want to hear the F Bomb, 7 times a minute.  And when you watch the show with subtitles, you see the actors ad-libbing a lot and throwing in extra F Bombs, not in the original script.  So, apparantly, they are being told to throw in what they want, and worry about editing later.And this is my common complaint for most HBO original programming, so all fault can't be thrown on the shoulders of The Wire writers.  For that 4 stars.Other than that, no other complaints.  Great show!MC White	5.0	Better than the Sopranos..	2006-05-23	10	5	5

Of course, everyone loves Omar (who would have made Good Police) but the entire cast is amazing and Baltimore even in its worst neighborhoods is hard not to like.I didn't find the first episode of The Wire compelling when it first aired on HBO but I picked up the first three seasons after watching The Corner while bored and rather liking the story but really liking the emotional arc of the story. The Wire in its entirety is wonderful so watching all the episodes is better than piecemeal so starting this show/acquiring all the episodes has to be a leap of faith.I hope everyone is fortunate enough to watch this show because despite the cursing and the use of the N word, these characters good and bad show that human life is very precious and deserves the utmost respect.This series compels repeat viewing so tape off of hbo if you can.Is this frugal?  no but I feel strongly that this show must be watched and is the best thing I have ever seen - better than Buffy, South Park or Justice League; it actually shows you why you must be good as a matter of social responsibilityWould I have purchased this used at a cheaper price off of craigslist?

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1PSV6C2UHF2IN	Dwyane	I had heard The Wire ranked up there with The Shield. Finally got to watch it after it came to Prime Streaming.  I have to say so far I'm not that impressed. There where a few good episodes but the acting wasn't all that believable by some of the cops or the story really didn't pull me in. Then you have the main character  that reminded me of Mark Wahlberg that I didn't care for either. I was more interested in the scenes with the drug pushers than the cops. I did like Idris in his role. Lance Reddick as the Lt was pretty goodI guess it was just a bit of a let down after hearing it ranked up there with The Shield as far as cop dramas. I've started on Season 2 and so far I don't really care for it either. I'm hoping it hits its stride mid/late in the season and turns it up by Season 3.	3.0	Not what I expected	2014-05-28	0	0	0

It's a great series to binge-watch because you don't have time to forget all the simultaneous sub-plots going on.Screen-time is split evenly between the cops and the drug dealers.  Both sides have to deal with similar challenges: managing a big group of people that sometimes back-stab each other, adjusting to new technologies, and deciding how to spread the blame around when things go wrong.  I found it interesting that the cartel's juvenile &#34;hoppers&#34; acting as lookouts, touts, runners, and entry-level &#34;product&#34; handlers were forbidden to get high because it would make them unreliable. . . so in a way, the cartel was keeping at least some kids off drugs!Cinematography, acting, dialogue and plot are all top-notch.  None of the &#34;dope fiends&#34; are the least bit chic or enviable, and it was clear that the dealers had zero respect for their customers.  Some of the cops' immediate bosses are the type that could make their employees eager to get out on the street and be shot at, just to get out of the office.  At the top police administrative levels, it's &#34;Dilbert&#34; with guns; any work that gets done is in spite of them rather than because of them.  The cartel's management structure is just as rigidly hierarchical but seems a lot more cohesive, possibly because the alternative is generally a cap in one's a--.On-screen sex scenes are short but graphic - people bothered by that kind of thing should maybe give it a miss.	5.0	Keep kids off drugs - hire them as dealers	2014-06-22	1	1	0

The quality of the screenwriting, the seemingly obsessive penchant for realism, the brilliant direction and the low-key acting combine into a series of the highest quality.  The dialogue fascinates.  And some of the best lines are spoken in low-key fashion without any fanfare.  This is a series that gives its viewers an amazing amount of credit.  Whether it's the language peculiar to the street, the drug dealers, the police, the lawyers or the politicians, no explanations are offered for the vernacular that is used.  There are no visual or musical ""billboards"" screaming, ""Big scene coming up."" The series and its plotlines simply unfold and leave it to the viewer to figure it all out.With that last point in mind, I have to warn those who are used to being cued by hamfisted directing, writing and acting as to what to expect next.  ""The Wire"" makes you put in your work as a viewer.  But you'll enjoy every minute of it.I'm not a young hipster new to the game; I'm 54 years old and have seen a lot of films and televisions series, but nothing like ""The Wire."""	5.0	The Best Dramatic Series In Television History	2005-02-16	11	11	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2L1TKGBAVT7ZF	"Edward D. Terhune ""Ed T."""	"Hard for me to top some of the more laudatory comments already made about this program set on the hard, seedy streets of Baltimore, but I feel as if I should try in this particular instance, as I seldom, and I do mean very seldom, have anything positive to say about the current state of TV, and that includes Cable-TV. Invariably, it panders to the lowest common denominator, it celebrates puerility and all that is execrable about humanity, and it unalterably infects our cultural atmosphere like some pestilential miasmic cloud of banality. This superb dramatic series, a singular exception to that nearly-uniform and depressing rule, is almost enough to restore my faith in the integrity and power of the creative process. I've never been a cop or a criminal, but I can't imagine any dramatic representation more realistic, or gritter, than this. There's no facile moralizing, no craven simplifications, no easy solutions offered, no stalwart cardboard saints pitted against stereotyped dark-hearted sinners. The ""hero"" of this show is a self-destructive, alcoholic detective, portrayed by the talented Dominic West. The ""villain"" is Russell ""Stringer"" Bell, a quietly-charismatic, cold-blooded drug-lord portrayed by the equally-talented Idris Elba. While Bell can certainly and unambiguously be classified as ""evil"", Elba is able to invest the character with a nuanced, complex humanity that, if anything, makes him even more terrifying than he might otherwise seem. As for the other roles, there isn't a bad actor in the ensemble, and the idiomatic dialogue is reminiscent of the better novels by George V. Higgins. Those involved in the creation of this show, to their great credit, assume that their audience is comprised of intelligent, thoughtful adults, and proceed accordingly. The result is a masterful TV-series that will surely restore the faith of those like myself who have become jaded and refuse to believe that anything significant or worthwhile can be produced in our contemporary culture...that includes movies, books, and music, much less TV. For these discriminating audiences, ""The Wire"" should serve as an exhilerating epiphany."	5.0	Flawless TV For Thinking Adults	2006-02-24	10	10	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2O8K7L29RLY54	"E. Kutinsky ""ekutinsky"""	"If you're like me, you never caught The Wire on HBO in any of its original, low-rated airings, and you heard - through critics, friends, in passing - that it was something akin to the Great Dramatic Series no one had seen, but you never quite wanted to get yourself hooked.  Well, I held out for years, and when I finally got to watching The Wire's critically acclaimed first series, I still had no idea what to expect - a bonus, perhaps, of the low ratings: even its best secrets remain hidden.  Like The Sopranos before it, The Wire creates such a rich web of characters and subcharacters, respects so thoroughly its creation of place and environment, that it takes no time to become absorbed in each brilliant, bristling detail - the show comes roaring in with ""The Target,"" and by episode 2, ""The Detail,"" we're already so entrenched in the reality of events, when a full-scale police-incited riot breaks out, it feels like the most natural, long-time-coming event that could have happened.  The Wire bristles with personality, by every character involved - Dominic West's drunk, egotistical, brilliant McNulty that leads his crew of detectives - the magnificent, moral Greggs (Sonja Sohn), the stalwart Lester (Clarke Peters) - is interesting enough, but he's the least interesting character considering the astonishing crop of personalities and performances that play out amidst the beaurocratic and street-led turmoil of the Baltimore streets - The Wire stands as such an accomplishment because its drug world is as vivid and corrupt as its police world.  In that, the personalities on the street - chilly, calm Stringer Bell (Idris Elba), confused D'Angelo (Larry Gilliard Jr.), smart, innocent Wallace (Michael B. Jordan) - become as absorbing as the world they inhabit.  Each unexpected, nuanced plotline flies in the face of ordinary - or even recognizable - TV convention and lets the conflicting humanity of these personalities jut up against their world, and simply lets us be mesmerized by their results.  I'm thinking of the plot thread that follows Bubbles, the heroin-addicted snitch played fearlessly by Andre Royo, who, in one astonishing scene at an NA meeting in ""One Arrest"" shows, with a mere flicker of his eye, his buried desire to live.  Where the season follows him from there is an indicator of everything this series does right - creates and fulfills the humanity buried in every corner of a dying city."	5.0	Completely extraordinary	2007-07-20	3	3	0

(I didn't even notice until it was mentioned in the commentaries.) I am pleased about that, for I get irritated when a show or film plays ""scary"" or ""romatic"" music to manipulate you. It just lacks subtlety. Not so on The Wire.The show is based to a very high degree on the experiences of police in Baltimore. One of the co-writers was a cop for 20 years.Just see if you can watch several episodes without using the F-word all the time and pronouncing ""all right"" like ""a-ight"". :)I am much more of a comedy fan than a thriller-fan (or whatever), but this one is recommended."	5.0	Very unusual	2005-09-04	9	9	0

During the last few episodes of Season 5, I was dreading coming to the end.  I will miss these people.Some things that the makers are clear about:  Not everyone is all-good or all-bad.  For all our good intentions, we don't always do the right thing, and no matter how bad we seem or, indeed, are, we can put others' interests before our own.  Whose code is more honorable, McNultey's or Omar Little's?  Is there even a difference between them?  Are the good guys really good and the bad guys really bad?  If the bad guys are really bad, why are they?I haven't read all the reviews, but of those I have, one thing not mentioned is how The Wire focuses on the issue of race in America.  If the bad guys are really bad, why?  It's a question we Americans never seem to get around to asking ourselves.  Point fingers, sure we do that.  Excuse ourselves, we do that, too.  Mostly, we get defensive when we might have to acknowledge that our institutions have ignored and left to its own devices a whole segment of society.Like all great novels, The Wire's conclusion ties everything together.  With scenes like Leandor Sydnor in Judge Phelen's chambers and Duquan Weems in the final montage, we get the feeling that we've been here before, and it makes me cry.	5.0	The Wire - All Five Seasons - An Experience	2014-06-27	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1C6YBC08CHBRA	fuzzylocks	"Long after the show aired its' episode, viewers have both critiqued and applauded the grisly inner city life challenges the show so harshly portrays. Yet with all the hullabaloo as to whether or not The Wire truly gave scope to a depressing and bleak American reality, The Wire has gained a dedicated follower in me. To start, I knew literally nothing about Baltimore prior to screening the show. The extent of my Baltimore knowledge was limited to where it was in relation to D.C. (where I attend university) and also that they have a marvelous aquarium that I still feel guilty I have not been to yet. Dissent Magazine's article ""Is The Wire Too Cynical?"" provides a fairly scathing review as to the show's failure to truly portray all the positive aspects of grassroots activism in the city, stating that not only does the show leave out such inspiring characters and story lines, but also does not acknowledge the law abiding poor. From an unbiased standpoint, this is true. Granted, I am only eleven episodes into the first season (don't give anything away!) but generally, those who live on the street are portrayed as very ""street"" and not, as The Code of  the Street by Anderson discusses, very ""decent"". In my opinion though, portrayal of hope and community effectiveness would take away from the show's bite and overall grit. As a television show, it has the power to shock viewers into wanting to make a difference, and think about problems they may not have realized existed before. I'd posit that the danger in including positive activism in a show like this tends to make viewers more comfortable with what they see. For example, if we knew that Wallace was put into a program for at risk youth after his trials and tribulations in the pit, his story would be wrapped up nicely and stamped with a big red ""success"" on his folder. Because there is very little social success that is depicted, the role of The Wire is not so much to display the good, as much as the bad and the despairing, in the hope that good will actually be catalyzed in our reality, off of the television screen."	4.0	Real vs. Reality: Why The Wire Matters	2013-01-28	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A32OQQJOJBU0QA	Gary G. Phillips	Season 1 of the wire was absolutely riveting. The urban towers setting is one we see in all of our own cities on some level.The drug and gang culture is unerringly depicted, but I think what makes the magic alchemy is the dialogue, which is as closeto rap as you can get in daily commication, on the poetic side.  The verbal exchanges by the drug gang and the narcotics/homocidedetectives is cutting edge, and actually requires close concentration at times to absorb the meanings.  Many major themes are explored in this show, including the absurdity at times of both selling drugs and apprehending drug sellers in the criminal justice system.  The system itself is flawed and contradictory at times, as is the reflection of Dee that the gang killings for the sake of money makes no sense.  As in all great and legendary programs, which I believe this show, and particularly season 1 ranks, the characterizations of characters, plot, casting, dialogue and exploration of the absurd is exquisite.	5.0	Wire Season 1 Realistically Mesmerizing	2014-06-18	0	0	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1GVVXMVBHVP4S	Gary Lee Morrison	I must say that in the first couple of episodes I thought I wouldn't be able to finish the First Season of The Wire; the language alone was getting to me. But then the story line and strong characterizations by an ensemble of brilliant actors hooked me and I could not stop watching. It is really a brilliant show. Season One was eye-opening and insightful in depicting the social and economic community within the Projects in Baltimore. Having recently read Isabel Wilkerson's The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration, about the migrations of African Americans out of the South to the north, east and west from the 1930s through the 1960s changing the human landscape of America and leading to the development of inner city ghettos and the various Projects in many of the major cities of America connected and made sense. America's endemic racism can be seen in the white power structures that created and perpetuates social inequality, injustice, spiritual and economic poverty; and what goes on in these Projects is a pernicious capitalism that cheapens life, undermines human values, and deepens the schism between Americans divided by race and capital. The well written scripts of The Wire have lines that are unforgettable and often sum up American values. The municipal politics, the relationships that govern the politics and actions of responsible citizens have created stasis - a feeling of no way out.  This is a must see series. But it's heavy, strong and gritty, and will change your views of many things.	5.0	A Knockout	2013-08-10	1	1	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3K43UM7TWLC6K	"Gc ""iPoker"""	I'm not sure why everybody like this show. It's terrible. I watched about 40mins into the first episode and couldn't stand watching it anymore. It's nothing but people cursing at each other and talking about things that doesn't relate or add to the story. There isn't even a story going on here, just hotheads and random crime scenes. The show was just too incoherent, not worth my time. It's really corny too. lol. I would normally watch a few more episodes before deciding to quit, but the first episode was just too painful to watch. My only reason for checking out this show is because Breaking Bad has ended.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	ABJ3A3KUSYBN	"Gizmola ""gizmola"""	I caught the wire during its debut run on HBO, and have been hooked ever since.  I feel a lot better about paying my HBO bill each month, just knowing that despite poor ratings, HBO has stayed behind this series, and renewed it for its (upcoming) 3rd season.I could throw out a list of adjectives to describe The Wire, and still not do it justice... it simply operates at a level just beyond anything that has ever been done before in series television.  There is of course Dominic West as Jimmy McNulty, the self destructive detective at the center of the Wire, a performance so admired in the entertainment business as to have turned the journeyman Brit actor into a bonafied A-List Movie star.  It's no surprise that West keeps coming back to the series.  But what's really amazing about The Wire, is the depth and complexity of its vast number of characters, routinely confounding your archetypal expectations about who these people appear to be.  There is no black and white in The Wire, only shades of grey, and that's what makes it so compelling.For many series, this alone would set The Wire apart, but what elevates it to greatness is its in depth exploration of crime, drugs, urban ghettos, politics, greed, ambition, and the people who each in their own way and place are trying to exist and do something with their lives.You might think that The Wire is all heady drama, when in fact, the magic of it, is that it's extremely subtle, and reveals itself brick by brick in a manner that will have you on the edge of your seat, or on the floor laughing hysterically.  At the end, what I marvel at, is that The Wire is at once all the things you'd expect in a masterpiece, and yet at the same time, profoundly entertaining.Thank goodness HBO has finally released series 1 on DVD so that I can stop raving to people like a lunatic about the series none of em saw.	5.0	Intense, complicated, profound: the best series ever.	2004-09-08	7	7	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A29RPRVTC0UXUH	"G. J. Rohr ""angryyoungman"""	I have'nt watched this show since after the first two episodes of the second season, it immediately did'nt do it for me. The first season of 'The Wire' did, it is a groundbreaking (I won't use that word more than once I promise) realistic well-casted story of a police department's special CID squad (detectives from different divisions) and their crackdown of drug-dealing and murder in the projects of West Baltimore. HBO went to great lengths to not make this show a carbon copy of other attempts at drama (Oz). The roles of career-hungry detectives with differnt agendas are played by actors whos' styles are as varying and attachable as their characters. The show moves along quickly with surprises and a perfect script, you can never predict what'll be said or who will return to the screen at any moment. The Wire shows three sides of the same coin, showing the measures and affects of the SINGLE 13 episode story when politics, careers and police procedure collide. Its not a new story every episode, its one complex but easy to follow road with dozens of side-streets in every hour-long episode, accompanied by perfect performances by actors you've never seen until now. The casting is excellent, the dialogue is raw and real but if you had a bunch of celebrities peppering this show it would lose its' authentic feel. Try it its' more than worth the price of the box set.	5.0	An Edge of Your Seat Inventive Enticing 13 Hours	2007-01-15	4	3	1

The Wire is one of the finest things HBO's done.The dual perspective - working both the drug dealers world and the law gives it a distinctive edge lacking in even the best television crime dramas.  It does the impossible, making you care about the criminals and putting the law in an often unflattering light, exposing infighting, career move climbing, backstabbing and corruption by those enforcing the law as much as those breaking it.  Everyone is revealed in the myriad complexity that humanity is.  Nothing so simple as black and white here.Everything about The Wire has the feel of authenticity to it - and with good reason, it was written by masters of crime writing in the real world.  The cast is remarkable down to the smallest of roles.Even if you've watched the series on HBO - the DVD set is indispensible and provides the best way to really watch theshow - 13 hours straight, no chaser!Bravo HBO!

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3HMWAHKTOVITE	"G. Rao ""grao!!!"""	Having been a big fan of HBO's other dramatic series, such as Oz, the Sopranos and Six Feet Under I was looking forward to the premiere of the Wire enthusiastically.  Unfortunately, I found the show far too complicated and confusing to follow along via the regular television broadcast schedule.  The DVD set remedied this for me quite nicely.The Wire is much more sophisticated than those other shows, and unlike any other cop drama I've seen on TV.  It goes into detail about the conflict between the Major Case Unit and the Barksdale drug gang.  It portrays the administrative hurdles the cops face in order to get warrants, as well as the behind the scenes politics that ultimately open and close big cases.  It treats the drug gang with no less attention, showing the individual drug dealers and their struggles all the way up the ladder.Its critical to watch these episodes in order because its easy to get lost.  The dialogue is filled with cop and drug dealer jargon, and the connection between one scene and the next isn't always apparent.  The DVD set makes this possible, and once you get a feel for what's going on you get hooked on this series quickly.	5.0	The most bestest TV show evah!!!	2005-02-15	7	7	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3A4WQL80WOTMH	Green Manalishi	Yes, the rave reviews are all true about The Wire, and yet the first few episodes in Season One might have you beleive otherwise.  Dialogue is a bit forced at times and sometimes has that 'scripted' feel.  It doesn't take long though for the show to find it's groove and total absorption to ensue - will certainly be the case by mid-season and definitely by the end.  Fortunately there are 4 more seasons after this each better than the next *though people argue about season 5.  Don't worry - you're in for a riveting ride, and more lost sleep than you might think possible.  Careful about starting this on a night (or week) where you have to get up the next day.  The dangerous thing about the DVD set is that you CAN go on to the next episode without needing to wait a week.  You can go on.. and on.. and on.I have to admit, McNulty was never my favorite character, and one of the reasons I feel later seasons are better than Season 1 (still great in its own right, no mistake) is that his dominance recedes season by season so that he's hardly even in Season 4.  I admit I kind of liked him in Season 5 - hey, the situation called for it.  But, that's another review.  Get 'The Wire'.  You'll love it.Other good Showtime/HBO:  Damages, Dexter, Breaking Bad.	5.0	Really takes off	2010-07-06	1	1	0

Just a brief over view of the 13 episodes is what I'll give you (each coming in at around 55 minutes).  It starts as mid-level drug dealer, D'Angelo Barksdale beats a murder rap. After a conversation with a judge, Det. James McNulty has been assigned to lead a joint homicide and narcotics team, in order to bring down drug kingpin Avon Barksdale. Avon Barksdale, accompanied by his right-hand man Stringer Bell, enforcer Wee-Bey and many lieutenants (including his own nephew, D'Angelo Barksdale), has to deal with law enforcement, informants in his own camp and around town, and competition with a local rival, Omar, who's been robbing Barksdale's dealers and reselling the drugs. The supervisor of the investigation, Lt. Cedric Daniels, has to deal with his own problems, such as a corrupt bureaucracy, some of his detectives beating suspects, hard-headed but determined Det. McNulty, and a blackmailing deputy. The show depicts the lives of every part of the drug ""food chain"", from junkies to dealers, and from die hard cops who are all about heir work, corrupt cops and brownnose higher ranking officials to clean and dirty politicians that lead to a very deep and compelling tale of the corruption, life and more then all, the truth in the city,  David Simon (who has been the main force in a few other great series' set in Baltimore The corner, and tv drama Homicide) brings this great tale to life and this may be the best series I've ever seen on TV!!!!!

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1PGC1GEBY9CZU	Happy Camper	The 2002 series The Wire, from the outside, didn't have anything the &#34;normal&#34; television cop show used.  It wasn't set in Los Angeles nor was it New York.  The Wire was set in Baltimore, Maryland.  Baltimore for Pete's sake!After one viewing most viewers, I believe, were ready to come back for the second episode.  Not only were they ready, they were likely rather anxious.  English born Dominic West plays a convincing native B'more Detective Jimmy McNulty.  McNulty verges constantly on the &#34;has been&#34;/gonna get in serious trouble to savant policeman.  He drinks, he messes around with other women, he is constantly at odds with his superiors and he always seems to have a way of getting things done.  That &#34;way&#34; is his redemption.S1E1 starts out with drug dealer D'Angelo Barksdale (Lawrence Gilliard Jr.) being acquitted of three murders.  McNulty KNOWS Barksdale is guilty but witnesses being intimidated to recant their testimony changes the game.  The judge, a long time friend of Jimmy's from his lawyer days, (Peter Gerety as Judge Daniel Phelen) knows Barksdale's guilty as well and is more than willing to help McNulty get a wire set up on the drug dealing murderers.The team is set up with Lt Cedric Daniels (Lance Riddick), lead detective Detective Shekima &#34;Kima&#34; Greggs (Sonja Sohn), Detective Ellis Carver (Seth Gilliam), and Detective Thomas &#34;Herc&#34; Hauk (Domenick Lombardozzi).Great writing and interaction of the actors as the police team truly make this a worthwhile series to watch.	5.0	A Breakthrough Series	2014-05-26	1	1	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A275I92X0HF8JI	HIGHDEFJEFF	"I wanted to somehow incorporate the word renaissance into this review, and find a clever way to call ""television in the last 4 years or so"" a renaissance. For lack of creativity I'll take a personal stance for this.I was never a regular television viewer. I always preferred the VHS and later the DVD over watching a television program. Seemed like such devotion to be there every week. But what was sparked by an interesting premise, 24 hours in the life of the counter terrorist agent, and each episode in real time, lured me in. I fell for 24, than I fell for the Shield when it premiered later a few months after 24 did. I am still thankful I saw ""The Shield"" advertisement on the corner of 39th and 9th Avenue.I always saw posters for The Wire on the Path Train. Had no idea what it was all about. I was chalking it up to another spy type show that ABC would produce perhaps. I heard all the critical acclaim, still didn't bite. Than I saw that HBO On Demand was showing episodes 1 through 5. So I tuned in. Watched all 5 episodes in one day. Went back and put them on a blank tape. I'm glad I didnt have to long for HBO to put a new batch of episodes On Demand. They showed 6-10 next. And that's when it got so damn hard. Episode 10 ends in such a cliffhanger and (for those who have the On Demand channels) the next set of episodes wasn't set to be available for 4 weeks or so.And thus my life for the beginning of this year was all about when the next batch of episodes would cycle through On Demand. I thought about savoring them too, when the middle of season 2 was shown I thought of watching one a week..it could never happen though.I could have reviewed the show and talk about the characters and the plot that just keeps going, two seasons now, with season three on the way. But it's the experience that should be the selling point. For those who have seen the show know what I mean. It almost hurts to have to wait a whole week to see ""what happens next"". For those who have never seen the show feel happy that you can now see all of Season 1, at once.24, The Shield, The Sopranos, Deadwood, and of course The Wire. It's a pretty fair arguement, or rather I can arguement my point well. Does television get any better than this?"	5.0	Bar None, the Best show ever produced for television.	2004-06-15	12	11	1

I once read that you can bring a group of conservatives, liberals, and libertarians together and they will all love The Wire, because they will all find something in it to confirm their worldview.  I'm sure this is true.  It's not because David Simon and Ed Burns made any effort to present a balanced view.  Quite the opposite: they presented an unflinchingly honest view.  So of course people draw from this what they draw from the real world.Many have said that The Wire is the greatest TV show ever produced.  I can't attest to that, but I will say that it is the greatest TV show I have ever watched.  And a very peculiar sort of TV show it is, appropriately described as ""novel-esque.""  Individual episodes rarely come with their own climax, viewers are expected to watch each episode and recall events from the beginning of the season at the end, and the cast of characters is sprawling.I have watched the entire five season run of The Wire, and it is a delight to see each characters beginnings again: the path for some is obvious, others veer sharply from the direction they were headed, and others are not as they appear.  And none are anywhere near where they will end up.  They multiply like cockroaches, but the main characters for season 1 are: Jimmy McNulty, the brilliant homicide detective with a disastrous personal life; Cedric Daniels, a straight-laced police lieutenant with a shady past and a bright future in the force; Kima Greggs, an openly gay and calmly competent narcotics detective; Bubbles, a loquacious heroin addict and reformer; and D'Angelo Barksdale, a mid-level drug dealer who beats a murder rap in episode 1 and is the nephew of the target for season 1.Each season of The Wire has a broad theme and focus (the entire series is thematically about institutional failure), and Season 1 focuses on street drug dealers through the prism of the effort to catch drug kingpin Avon Barksdale and the self-destruction of homicide detective Jimmy McNulty.I think the hype that you can't miss an episode and that it takes a while to get into is overblown.  I missed an episode on my initial watch of each season and maintained a pretty good hold on what was going on.  I was also hooked from watching the last half hour of an episode on HBO while on a business trip, postponing drinks with my coworkers to finish what I thought was some masterful gangster movie that had somehow escaped my notice.  That being said, this is not a show to put on in the background while wandering in and out of the living room.  It does demand your attention.The Wire is notoriously hard to follow, but the producers do what they can to help on the DVD.  Selecting an episode opens another menu with options to watch the ""previously on,"" to watch the ""next on,"" to select a scene, and provides an introductory synopsis for the episode.Simon and the other commentators provide a lot of great context and insight on the DVD commentary, but it can also get overbearing.  To a certain extent, particularly when Simon gets into his personal views, it can become ""sausage making.""  Only the first, second, and penultimate episode of the season have commentary.  Please be forewarned that spoilers abound, including spoilers for the second season."	5.0	A Novel (and a Great One) in DVD Form Told Over 13 Hours	2011-09-01	1	1	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3NH7PYU4AD5GA	H. Schneider	I don't watchTV, except news and some football. I never heard of The Wire until I had discovered other series on DVD, mainly Deadwood and Boardwalk Empire. So I encountered this 2002 crime series only 10 years later. I had heard that it is considered by some to be the best ever. That is quite possibly true.In 2002, the FBI had a new job description, defined by 9-11, and was not interested in drug gangs.The Baltimore police, under pressure from the judiciary after a witness murder,  sets up a special unit, half heartedly, to investigate a mystery man related to drug distribution and murders. The unit consists of some dead weight guys and some outsiders, but it grows into the job. There is more than just drugs and killing witnesses or rivals. There is a vast real estate scam and political corruption, extending into the police force. We are following both sides, the cops as well as the gangs in their business processes.The series has 13 episodes. It focuses on this one big case, the job of unravelling the gang. The work is based on electronic surveillance, hence the series title. The cast consists of  unknown professional actors, no stars. The script stays away from cheap effects. Romance or happy ends we must live without.	5.0	Reality TV	2012-04-03	1	1	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A17RG4CS9EYYUS	"hydrophilic ""hydrophilic"""	"Since there are tons of reviews here singing the praises of 'The Wire', I wanted to aim my review at the people out there who are on the fence about whether to check out this criminally under-rated show.I watched the first episode of 'The Wire' when it first aired, and decided that I didn't like it. To me, it looked like an unfortunate combination of ""Lost"", ""Sopranos"" and ""Oz"". ""Lost"", because as the viewer, you know the characters are never going to succeed, either in getting off the island or getting Baltimore off drugs. I figured there would be a pattern of episodes where the police gain some traction in the drug war, and then the drug dealers would rally, and then the police would come back, et cetera, ad nauseum. ""Sopranos"", because I assumed there would be many bacchanalian scenes where the evildoers revel in their unlimited access to wealth, power, and women. ""Oz"", because it looked relentlessly bleak and violent. I'm not knocking any of those shows, it just seemed to me like 'The Wire' was taking the worst parts of all three.I reluctantly tried the series again because my friends kept raving about it. And here I am, five years later, to say the hype is true. 'The Wire' may well be the best television ever.'The Wire' is first and foremost, a superbly crafted story. As others have said, the season is really one long narrative with thirteen separate chapters. This frees up the television medium considerably. Episodes are not themed, do not uniformly end with shocking twists, and don't adhere to any formula of ""primary plotline interspersed with two minor plotlines."" The acting is brilliant, the dialog is razor-sharp, and view of corruption and poverty is unflinching.Before seeing this show, I have always said that ""Homicide (Life on the Street)"" was the best television series ever made. 'The Wire' includes many of the same elements, but the format - long story arcs and no censorship - take it much further than Homicide ever went.HBO has also shown an admirable restraint in the depiction of violence. 'The Wire' is a violent show, but most of it takes place off-screen, and some of the most memorable scenes are almost finished before you notice them. In one scene, a dealer stops at a shady-looking convenience store for a late night snack, and literally everything in the store, including the owner, is protected by a bullet-proof sheet of glass. In another scene, children from the projects leave for school with a small bag of chips for lunch. The lucky ones also get a juice box.I don't know if this show is qualitatively better than the Sopranos, but personally, I enjoy the Wire more. I would say the Wire is less ambitious in scope, but what it does, it does better. Unlike 'Sopranos' 'The Wire' is plot-driven, which means the characters must serve the story. However, character-driven or not, I got tired of being inside Tony Soprano's head after a few years. Tony is after all a banal, violent man. This may be a realistic depiction of a mafioso, but it does begin to wear. 'The Wire' performs that miraculous trick of depicting boredom, pettiness and venality with actually being boring, petty or venal. People and places are ever so slightly larger than life. It's gritty enough to keep it real, while fantastical enough to keep you enthralled.Finally, the series had the guts to do what almost no other show does: end. The final episode in the season actually brings everything to an incredibly satisfying (though not necessarily neat) conclusion.I hope I've brought at least one more viewer on board to this truly excellent series. A few last notes:- Buy or rent the DVDs. You are going to be lost without subtitles.- Be aware that the dialogue includes an incredible amount of profanity. If that offends you, you will hate this series, all the pros notwithstanding.- As others have warned, the DVD menus contain spoilers. Be careful not to read the plot summaries at the start of every episode. You can't skip them, so just close your eyes and keep pressing ""play."" Also be aware that some of the commentary contains spoilers for following seasons.- A lot of people have said that the good guys aren't so good and the bad guys aren't so bad. This is true. However, don't be fooled into thinking that the show is simple moral relativism. A corrupt cop may beat up a suspect; a high level drug dealer might commit a murder. The show is about many things, primarily about individuals versus the institutions they serve. It also makes a lot of interesting statements about the nature of information - what the cops can glean from the criminals, what the criminals figure out about the cops, what the cops hide from each other. To paraphrase the series tag line, everyone is listening carefully.- On top of everything else, this show is funny!"	5.0	For the doubters out there	2008-07-28	9	9	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3M4ZGT4Q71UGN	Iain Bason	I wasn&#8217;t disappointed, although of course it isn&#8217;t as perfect as everyone says. I have no idea how well it reflects reality, but the characters are well drawn, and the plots hold my interest. Perhaps the best sign that this is well done is that when I watched a scene with police clearly abusing their authority, I felt sympathy for them as well as for the suspect.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	ABYOSJAX56FZ9	Jason P. Archer	How can I title this review such? The writing is the first reason. You could have the same cast and general storyline with terrible or sub-par writing and have an instantly forgettable show. With the writing of the first season of The Wire, not to mention the second or third seasons, we are practically giddy as we experience these characters uttering these masterful words and performing their acts. We do not instantly forget but are left with impressions that will probably never leave us. Who will ever forget D'angelo's lecture to the young dealers about the man who came up with the chicken mcnugget? The second reason would have to be the realism. We get the feeling that while we know that this is fiction it COULD be real. The mean streets of Baltimore as interpreted by David Simon, et al. What differentiates this from other shows of its kind? A drug dealer is a person. A real person with problems, heart, and at times extreme intelligence. Take Stringer Bell, a drug kingpin who takes college economics classes to better his drug business. Also take D'angelo Barksdale , a man who doesn't like his underlings to treat the junkie customer with disrespect, as a dog.In an article I read not too long ago about the third season of The Wire the show was described as a novel (each season) cut up into chapters (each episode). Don't think that you can start in the middle of the season; you might as well start in the middle of a novel. This series is a show for the thinking person. You must be willing to invest your time and mind. Don't expect it to be simple; do expect to enjoy the mental ride.How can I truly put into words how great this series is? After you watch the first episode you will be hooked. If you are not hooked by the end of the first episode when D'angelo Barksdale is walking away from the murder scene of a man intimately related to him and you see the look on his face then this show isn't for you. If it is then keep watching and enjoy the unfolding of the story of the Barksdale crew and the special police detail trying to bring them down.	5.0	The best show on television, now or ever, hands down.	2004-10-18	62	56	6

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A13Z0IGUFQBJ4X	Jason Steiner	Television is full of serials. Most shows - even the good ones - are little more than soap operas, with the characters being thrown into contrived situations week after week. At any time, the show could be taken off the air, and you wouldn't really miss much.The Wire isn't a serial. It's a fully-realized story, with a plot that integrates everything from the opening dialogue to the final pan.If there's one TV series that begs to be watched in a single sitting, The Wire is it. At 13 hours, I don't think many people will manage it, but the DVD will give them the opportunity to try.	5.0	The best story on television.	2004-09-16	5	4	1
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2B3STNWXGP4Y5	Jay Autocross 43	The Wire is an American classic. I cannot attest to the accuracy of its portrayal of the drug culture and law enforcement. Fortunately for me I cannot attest to it. However, it rings painfully true. Set in the recent past in Baltimore, the miniseries format allows for rich character development so that there are no unambiguously heroic portrayals and few characters who stimulate no sympathy. The long format also allows the concurrent exploration of multiple plot lines.Adding to the realism, more than half of the cast are African-Americans, there is no background music of rising strings to tell you when the plot is thickening and a moment of tension is approaching. The plot and the performances take care of that quite well. The Wire is an outstanding series in every way and should be seen for the excellence that it is.	5.0	Window on a World I Hope to Never Visit	2014-06-07	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1QCA3WU52B3DW	jay	I heard that this is the greatest show ever on TV. I was worried it couldn't live up to the hype, it does.Important things to remember, it's not structured like a normal show. Most TV shows will have a sub plot that runs every episode, this doesn't. It's set up like a book, things aren't going to be 100 percent clear in the beginning. But it will all come together. If it doesn't, you didn't pay attention and this is a show you NEED to pay attention to.This show will not hold your hand through most scenes. If something big happens, it won't alert you to it with music, or a close up or a character telling you that this is important. It expects you to realize what's going on.Most of these actors I don't know, so to me it is really easy to believe that they are not actors but these are the actual lives of these people. It's meant to feel like a documentary, and it truly does feel like one.There were very few moments that wowed me or made me feel extreme emotions, but yet, every time an episode ended, I had to know what was going to happen. Even when I finished the season and everything wraps up, I had to start the second one right away and see what happens next.I recommend this show to any and everyone, above the age of 18. It's a great show and you should give it a try. I am done with three seasons and I can tell you, that if the first one was just good to you, you'll like the second and especially the third one a lot more.	5.0	Easily the best show I have ever seen	2013-09-05	1	1	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3OBP99ZV5TG6C	Jay	I am in the business - I run a Tac Squad.  Normally, I stay away from this kind of show telling folks that if I wanted a slice of real life, I would go sit on a street corner.  Well... I found my exception.  This first season caught me hook, line, and sinker.  The dialogue is not far off from what I hear on the streets 6 years and a couple of thousand miles away.  The networks, lookouts, interviews, interactions between agencies - all of it is dead on (except for the drinkin, carousing, etc...!!!).  If you ever wondered what the guys in the blue jeans and raid jackets really do - this is as close as you can get to a ride-along!!I highly recommend this series - at least the first season - I start season two tomorrow!!All the best,Jay	5.0	"""The"" Series to watch for good law enforcement drama!!"	2008-10-27	2	2	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A17ARP0R0OYYBE	J-Dubs	I recently discovered the series The Wire 2 weeks ago when I picked up season 1 on DVD. Personally, i'm not a big fan of cop/drama shows however, everyone I know gives the show rave reviews and holds it in high regard so i figured i'd pick it up.At first, I wasn't too fond of the show.  On the surface, the first few episodes seemed like your typical run of the mill police show, but soon enough i truly started caring for the characters on my screen.  The show is exceptionally well-written with a complex storyline and every episode is packed with so much drama its almost as if every episode has been adapted from a novel.I enjoy that the story isn't simply told from the police officer's point of view, but also The Barksdale Crew, who are the drug dealing gang that supplies crack and heroin throughout their Baltimore projects.I highly reccomend this series to anyone who enjoys really well-written television dramas. It's a shame that the show wasn't a bigger hit back when it was on the air.  Along with The Sopranos, The Wire is one of the best drama series that has come out in the past decade.	5.0	Excellent show	2011-07-18	0	0	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3BBF0G65BARFZ	Jeanne	I don't know where to begin-the plot, the acting, everything about The Wire is beyond amazing.  I kept having to remind myself these were just actors and not real people.  The story and characters work their way into your brain in such a way you feel you know and understand them.  The method of storytelling, where you have the perspective of both police and wrongdoers and those caught in the middle converging, sometimes violently, leads to a profound understanding of the social conditions of poor drug-plagued neighborhoods and what motivates everyone involved in the dynamic.  Perhaps nothing I've ever seen before has led me to question the seeming futility of the 'war on drugs' like this program.I almost can't believe every actor out of this program hasn't hit the big time, though I'm happy at least a few (Idris Elba, Michael B Jordan) have continued to rise in their profession.	5.0	The best TV show I've ever seen	2014-04-12	1	1	0

That was good.Intelligent, realistic, not your usual cop story, very well acted ( Dominic West's best performance ).This series is so good, I finished the first season like 3 weeks ago, and I haven't seen the second just yet, because, just like a junky from this series, I don't want to see them too quickly, I don't want something this good to finish too soon.Buy it, take your time to see the details, watch it several times if you need to, enjoy it!

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3IYXMGNHFQWLL	Jesse Rose	"Just a few days ago, I joined the growing club of people who claim that The Wire is the best television series they've ever seen. ""Great,"" you might think if you've never seen it before. ""Another yahoo who thinks this stupid show is the greatest production ever made. How could it possibly be that good? It's probably just hugely overrated like Citizen Kane or The Arcade Fire."" The show Family Guy even worked in a good jab about people get literally brainwashed into thinking The Wire and Breaking Bad are the greatest shows ever. Can it really live up to that level of hype?Well, I finished the series for the first time this week, and all I can say is that it truly does. I've seen a number of great shows in the past, but The Wire has accomplished things that I've never seen done before, and it commits to them with a level of quality that is unparalleled. With all of the reviews out there crowing praises for The Wire, what more can I possibly add? Well, I'll just jot down a brief list of what I think differentiates this show from any other, and maybe it'll convince you to take your first step like I did last year.SPRAWLING CAST OF CHARACTERS: There are a ton of characters in The Wire from all walks of life, so many that it can at times be difficult to keep track of them all. (The only other show I can think of to feature such a large number of characters is Game of Thrones, but I haven't watched that yet, so I can't make a proper comparison). There are police officers, police bosses, homicide detectives, judges, lawyers, politicians, longshoremen, elementary school students, teachers, drug dealers, junkies, thieves, and newspaper staffers. More than that, almost every character has a full and developed story of their own, and you'll want to know what happens to each and every one of them. (I promise.)REALISM: One of the many things that bug me about primetime TV programming is how black-and-white a lot of shows make everything out to be. The good guys, while sometimes flawed, are the good guys, and the bad guys are all bad. In The Wire, these moral lines are frequently blurred. Police officers and politicians often make decisions to save or advance their careers at the expense of others, and many drug dealers and junkies featured seem to be an inevitable product of their crumbling infrastructure, driven to commit crime because it seems like there's no other viable option.Even more than that, it seems to me that mainstream shows like CSI or NCIS depict a crime force that seemingly has access to unlimited funds to run whatever tests they want in an insanely short period of time; they also have no problem pursuing leads or getting the appropriate paperwork signed because, of course, the agent in question knows best and must have whatever resources he/she needs to crack the case. In The Wire, it's hard to tell what the greater villain is, drug kingpins like Avon Barksdale and Marlo Stanfield or budgetary constraints. In Baltimore, there isn't enough money to go around, so high-tech or creative projects necessary to catch the high-ranking bad guys often get axed. In addition, criminal pursuits can be ignored or manipulated to serve the needs of the government. I've never seen a mayor tell Gus Grissom not to follow a lead because it'll nuke Las Vegas' crime stats and upset the voters.Lastly on this subject, The Wire is straight with you about life. Sometimes the good guys fail, and sometimes the criminals get away with it. Sometimes life is good to you; sometimes it is mercilessly cruel. With The Wire, you never once feel like you're being pandered to or given a happy fantasy realm where justice is always served fairly, the government and its attached entities always try to protect your best personal interests, hard work is always rewarded with success, and unicorns frolic in the meadows with leprechauns and hippogriffs. I understand that some people don't care for such an honest and occasionally brutal look at life, but I do, and a lot of other people do as well. I also don't like being lectured by my fiction in a heavy-handed manner, and while The Wire has some pretty strong ideas about a bunch of things, I never feel like any of it is being forced down my throat. It isn't concerned with simplistic moral platitudes; it just wants you to realize that not everything in life is as simple as we often make it out to be.THE ""VISUAL NOVEL"": David Simon, co-creator of The Wire, has often called his show a ""visual novel."" In this, he typically means that, like the chapters in a written novel, everything that happens slowly unfolds and feeds into later episodes. This runs contrary to mainstream television where, for the most part, every single episode wraps its central plot up in a nice, tidy bow with no unanswered questions (save for ongoing series arcs about a mysterious serial killer or a mole in the department or whatever). This makes for a complex and challenging show which actually drives the viewer to really think hard about what it is that they're watching, a show with no simple answers.Not only that, but The Wire is similar to a novel in that, at times, it seems as though ongoing themes are almost more important than the characters themselves: big, profound themes like urban decay, corruption of authority, the struggles of the American underclass, the efficacy of drug prohibition, institutional dysfunction, the downside of unlimited capitalism, and the many, many battles that individuals wage with themselves and others on a daily basis. The Wire is, essential, the Great American Novel come to life, something I've never seen done on TV. It may not ever be done again, either.SHEER QUALITY: This, at the end of it all, is probably the biggest aspect that kept me watching and loving what I saw through all 5 seasons. The dialogue, for instance, is golden. Each episode has at least 10 great lines to savor, including those that serve as the opening quotation of that episode (""Come at the king, you best not miss,"" for example - mouth-wateringly wonderful and infinitely quotable). The acting is brilliant, believable, and nuanced; I can't even name anybody as ""the best"" because everyone brings their A-game on this one. And the plot itself is fresh and engaging, often defying expectations and refusing to trot out tired, clich&eacute;d story developments. Altogether, I'm seriously shocked that a series this good and groundbreaking exists as perfectly as it does. So very little of anything filmed, either TV or cinema, can go very far before network executives demand that the material be dumbed-down or simplified in order to make it more palatable to the American masses. The Wire's existence solidifies the notion in my mind that HBO is the premiere place for quality TV; AMC has really been catching up lately, but as much as I loved Breaking Bad (and anyone who asks me knows that I do), I feel like the The Wire is ultimately a better and more important show.End of list.Wow. That's a lot to say about a TV show in a mere Amazon review, and if nobody's reading this little summary, I wouldn't blame them for skipping out. Still, I've got to say all this in the hopes of attracting more potential viewers of the show. The more people shell out for DVD sets and/or subscription service (they offer all their shows to subscribers for free on demand, folks!), the more likely HBO will continue to put out this caliber of TV programming in the years to come. Not only that, it's just an amazing show, one that will forever change the way you look at what the medium of television can do. If I can get even one more person to watch it, I will have probably done them a immeasurable favor of which the dividends are many. So get to it, folks! Vote with your wallets and join the club!"	5.0	Join the Club	2014-06-11	2	2	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1TVC0S2BZCA1S	"Jesse Schreier ""Schro"""	The Wire is the best show I have ever seen. For its vision and for its directing and acting, no other television program compares.  When you watch The Wire, you get a unique window into our cities and ourselves as Americans.  It's a disturbing view.  The Wire depicts a society that does not care about the hundreds of murders that happen in a place like Baltimore each year and that actually wages war on its own people (the underclass).  It reveals a place where the empty promises of politicians echo in the city's thousands of vacant houses and abandoned factories and where people excluded from our society's economy struggle to be included and to fulfill their own version of the American dream.  In short, The Wire lays bare the reality that our cities have become something utterly unrecognizable to many of us, and sadly irreparable.Contrasted with the apathy and decay of these urban surroundings are the characters that give us hope.  They come in many guises:  drug addicts trying to get clean and reform themselves, drug dealers attempting to make themselves into legitimate businessmen, and cops struggling, against all their own personal faults and institutional limitations, to do their jobs the right way, even if no one outside of their department cares.  In the end, The Wire asks its viewers to be as courageous as its heroes. TV could not possibly be more important than The Wire. It's a show that needs to be seen.	5.0	The Wire Season 1	2005-01-24	13	11	2

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3QLMB71UR7DZ9	J. Krasick	"The debate over ""The Wire"" realistic storylines and characters, really take away from the overall message - that in ""order to make things better you have to take action."" A criticism of ""The Wire"" is its lack of showing success stories, such as the work done by Baltimore's ACORN and Algebra Project. These groups mobilized families and teachers to pressure a Mayor to provide state funds to better the public school system. But that is in no way ""The Wire"" mission or intent to show its audience. Even creator David Simon explained that the show was meant to show the ugly side of urban city life and provoke action.It is my belief that ""The Wire"" is has a lot of relevance today. It is fascinating that even five years after the series has ended, you can still see storylines and characters in everyday urban politics and even on some level the American nation. As a Philadelphia resident, I have witnessed the city become a place with some of the highest death and crime rates. Furthermore, the school system has completely fallen apart, as the neighborhoods and families fight with the city and school district over the reorganization of the system. In the ""Is The Wire Too Cynical?"" authors Atlas and Drier say that Obama represents the hope again as Bush ends his two terms, while paralleling this with the ending of The Wire. To be clear, I am a supporter of Obama and support many of his policies and platforms, but I believe he in some ways mirrors Carcetti. In season 4, Carcetti is the hopeful young politician who desires to improve the city of Baltimore, but when he gets into office - he learns that politics is a game and by season 5, he is more interested in look to the next election instead of his original mission.Overall, I believe that while ""The Wire"" at times is a little exaggerated it does have relevance to our world. But most of all this should not be a ""pity party"" show that makes people angry, but a show that makes people driven to improve the problems in their own cities."	5.0	real vs. fake	2013-01-29	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AD6A27B1O7516	Joe Hightower	To anyone who hasn't seen 'The Wire' I cant express in strong enough terms how good this series is.  Every ingredient required to make an unforgettable crime/drama series is found in this show.  From the writing and dialogue to the acting and pace of the events that take place 'The Wire' is among the best, if not the best, that has ever been seen.  I have seen all 5 seasons and they are all excellent.  If you expect television programs, as I do, to depict life in an urban area to remain true to reality and be as authentic as possible then you will love this show.  I've recently tried to watch popular crime dramas such as 'Law & Order' and others and I honesty laugh out loud at how contrived the stories are and how untrue to life the dialogue is.  If you don't know what I'm saying then start with season 1 of 'The Wire' and you'll see what I'm talking about.	5.0	Absolutely Near Perfect ...	2008-07-07	0	0	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2EBERMFR8JH3U	JoeK71	Ok, if youre not a native speaker you need the subtitles and a lot of phantasy to understand the drug-slang. And ok there are parts of it where no real action takes place.But I think thats what causes the thrill. The changes between action and slower parts make the well dosed action much more exciting. And the very best of it: The action isnt actually shown. Screen becomes black and you just here the sound. Or only the consequences are shown but not the real action. Ok there are explicit words but who cares. I somehow get the impression its better to show some exploding heads than using some words...If you are used to 24 or The Shield this isnt the common way to handle this kind of scenes. But this it what makes The Wire so different and so exciting.	4.0	Boring or exciting?	2006-08-02	4	1	3

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A31T292XGBFNDZ	Johnathon	"I had 1000's of hours of viewing movies, television series, and television programming behind me before I sat down to watch this series on DVD, season one, the box in my hand.  I was very dissapointed.  This series stinks.  I watched only episode 1, and have the experience and perception to know that it won't get any better.The story settled in episode 1 on 3 places - a rundown, neglected inner city lower class neighborhood, the offices of the detectives, and it goes back and forth between a courtroom and the street busts of drug dealers from vans and unmarked cars.I didn't like the profanity.  It went on for too long, filled every one's mouths, and didn't have a point to it after the first 40 minutes.  Everyone was swearing and cursing and it bored me.I got bored with it.  It didn't help to develop character or story and offended me after having it fill my ears for 40 minutes.The profanity was so thick in the first 35 minutes I got bored.  I coulden't understand what anyone was saying to each other because of the broken english, cursing and swearing, and lude and immature banter everyone engages in.  In short, I coulden't follow the story.  If gangster talk and street slang wasn't worse enough, the profanity and constant cursing just filled in the rest of the dialogue, it felt like the scriptwriters got bored with developing character and story.Realistic depictions of the life, the neighborhood and what the characters do could be done in less time, with less coarse language, and with more skill. Slow motion, some music, careful planning of the shots, some better storytelling, and the same messages would have come across in half the time.  Obviouslly, the people behind the show lack that kind of talent to pull it off.If watching cheap white trash and cheap black trash destroy themselves and probably each other interests you, this is for you.  I have a better way to spend my evenings. I experience enough negativity in the world on a daily basis, that I don't have to put it in my dvd player after dinner for it to ""entertain"" me.When I was a child I did as children did, but when I became a man I put away childish things.Less then 1 star is my vote."	1.0	Very boring to watch - dehumanizing, densensitizing, coarse.	2005-06-27	449	57	392

I will most definitely purchase all the seasons when I have the opportunity.My only criticism is with the price of the show. I found the Season 1 DVD set at Target for $17.99; digital media should be significantly less expensive than the hardcopy.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2A5OR0XYKXI54	John P.	Review of Season 1 only:Told from various perspectives simultaneously, this seemingly simple story-arc provides real depth to each perspective. For those not accustomed to urban-ghetto dialects, some of the dialog can be difficult to understand at first, but familiarity grows with each episode. Some complain of a slow pace, but I agree with those who point out that this show flows at a more 'real world' speed, complete with complexities, distractions, shifting priorities, etc. And while not awash in flashy 'chase' scenes, it does have it's fair share of blood and gore, as the story requires.Easily one of the finest US-crime series ever made, never trite or comic-book-simple, never preachy - all sides are shown, flaws and strengths.	4.0	Classic large-story-arc ...	2014-05-09	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A30NEB69DC1RSP	"Joseph Devon ""Author of Probability Angels"""	The Wire is the type of show that can easily encourage hyperbole in its reviews.  The show centers on the drug trade in the city of Baltimore and takes you inside this world effortlessly and completely by offering not just the perspective of the police trying to eliminate drug trafficking but that of the users, the dealers, the smugglers, the pushers and the criminal bosses as well.The writing can't be beat, every scene is well crafted, written and acted and the show manages to get across any number of salient points without ever seeming preachy or ever forgetting that its primary job is to tell the most riveting tales possible.As a writer I have to mention the uncanny command of dialogue that the writers employ.  By your second or third episode you'll find yourself following along with conversations that are almost spoken in their own language, from street talk to the terminology used in police stations to the phrases tossed around in political circles. Everything is captured in perfect dialogue and delivered by actors who make it seem like they've been speaking these dialects for years.If The Wire isn't the best show to ever air on television than it is most certainly the best show to air this millennium.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AAY9ELJLW3RQ3	J. Rosenfeld	By far one of the best televison shows that has ever been produced.  If you are coming from the world of network television or even fluffy reality shows on cable, the edginess and tough situations of the show will shock you.  But keep watching, and you will soon understand that the education, political, social, and economic issues of impoverished urban areas are not so simple.  And more important, maybe you will soon discover that life is far from black and white, and those that are constantly portrayed as the villains of our society (drug dealers, drug smugglers, etc.) are not as morally incorrect as we would assume.  Sometimes its not about your job, but the enviroment and reasons that cause one to work in that position.	5.0	Don't read anymore reviews just get all 4 seasons and watch them	2007-09-19	1	1	0

This is NOT one of those shows. Honestly, the characters in this show are horrid at best. Cliched to the point of sighing out loud while watching alone. I honestly felt like it was a chore to sit through these episodes... This show has the same Dexter-Post-Season 1 fanbase. The show is average at best, yet receives 5-Star reviews across the board.

Its not that I think I'm too good for, it just usually doesn't interest me.  Up until The Wire, the only show that really captivated me had been Twin Peaks.  This show is completely different, but even more captivating.  This is easily the best TV series I have ever seen.  It is deep and complex.  You don't keep watching because you wanna know what happens, but because you want to under why everything is happening and how it all fits in to the bigger picture.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1YLE4WIPHNZGT	JTS	I just finished watching Season 5 of The Wire and can say without a doubt that this series is an amazing journey from beginning (Season 1) to end (Season 5).  This show is for those that crave interesting storylines, unpredictable plot twists, characters that really grow on you from episode to episode, season to season and still somehow stay grounded to reality...its a show that breaks the rules and challenges the viewer.  Even though this show didnt win tons of awards like The Sopranos it is in my opinion a more rewarding viewing experience than The Sopranos.  This show is not for those who are impatient and have short attention spans or want instant gratification...if you are then you won't last the first few episodes of season 1.  The beauty of The Wire is that it grows and evolves so by the time you reach the final season things fall into place in such a masterful way that it is time well spent.  So if your ready for the journey then grab Season 1, keep an open mind, be patient, and absorb this masterpiece.	5.0	No spoilers here just a strong recommendation	2009-10-24	2	2	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A76I7PCZQLX55	Junior Cruden	This show was recommended to me by somebody from Baltimore who was familair with the city and the problems they are facing.He claimed that the point that differentiates this show from all the other police shows was the in-depth look at all the particpants in the urban drugs scene, from the street junkie up to the policy makers in Town Hall without having the cliche good or bad label stamped on the characters.And man, was he right. The characters are extremely realisticly played along with a classic story line of a police investigation but with a very contemporary feel to it. This show is educating you on how people are influenced and react to their environment and it makes you understand -even if you don't agree - why and how people become what they are.The show has some scenes with hard violence but this is very well timed and perfectly fitting within the context of the story line and is not oversensationally bloody.In the beginning I was a bit shocked to hear so much explicit language by all the chararcters but at least it did not feel as overacting. In the end you get used to it but I listened with headphones on to avoid that my kids would listen in on the language.In general the lingo used is very authentic (xtreme street slang and police jargon)and was for me most of the time hard to follow all the dialogues but this also gives the show it's extremely raw feel.I worked around this issue by watching the show with subtitles on.I have seen the second season as well and the directors/creators succeeded in keeping everything realistic (no romantisation of the characters) and of a extremely high level (casting is superb!).For me this is the best police show on TV and that is coming from a diehard NYPD Blue fan!	5.0	The Wire - probably the best police show on TV	2007-01-10	6	6	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3C1J2OE0H05MJ	"JunkyardMessiah ""jonkadane"""	"The Wire is HBO again hitting it straight out of the ball park.  Just like Oz and the Corner (two of HBO's other critically acclaimed but under-appreciated dramas) the Wire makes your heart bleed for the ""bad"" guys, makes them and the people that chase them seem, at the end of the day, human-- flawed, fragile, evil, in need of redemption, and  in some cases, better off with a bullet in the brain.  This first season was great, and the second season managed to be even better.The best thing about this show is that it turns every part of your brain ON.  You  can't watch it after you had a couple beers and are ready to doze off in front of the TV.  You need to be awake, alert  to follow the twists and all subtle character stuff.  In a word: bliss.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2ZAYFO9ED46ZA	Justin J Wheeler	Here is why The Wire is better than any other show ever: David Simon is able to get you to simultaneously love and despise almost every character on the show at different times.  Over a season, you both root for and root against almost everybody.  Characters are genuinely human, just like the people in our daily lives, as opposed to being contrived, unrealistic, and paper-doll cutouts like on other &#34;Good&#34; shows like Breaking Bad or Mad Men or Game of Thrones.Simon also creates a flow from episode to episode that is thoroughly satisfying, with a true story-arch within each episode but also wonderfully setting up the reason to watch the next one.  Contrast that with the consistently over abused Flashback and Cliffhanger-per-episode formula that Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones exhaust you with....that's lazy writing and producing.The Wire was also brilliantly cast and ensemble-acted, as evidenced by the fact that it had no superstars and nobody has gone on from the show to be a superstar.  That's called balance.  I wish Hollywood got that...you don't need to create superheroes or super villains for us, guys.  You don't need to create characters around which the rest of the characters revolve like a Sun.  In The Wire, we're as delighted to focus on Bubs as we are McNulty or Daniels.While I have enjoyed Simon's other shows as well, nothing has quite been as good as The Wire.  Seasons One and Three, in particular.Thank you, David.	5.0	Even Watching Now, 12 Years Later, The Best TV Show Ever Produced	2014-05-31	2	2	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1V0ZC07Y4CCTS	Kandi Nielsen	I'm giving this 4 stars but up until Episode 7, My husband and I would have rated it lower. This series has so many characters - many going by nicknames - that it was hard to follow. There are so many back-stories to each character that are alluded to but not clarified, so it left these viewers confused, unsure of where the plot was going. I was ready to give up but didn't and by Episode 7, it all started to make sense. Some of the dialogue is hard to understand if you don't live in the inner-city and hang out with drug dealers so we missed a lot - may have to watch it again.A good cop drama, about drugs, money, &#34;dirty&#34; cops and politicians.	4.0	Starts off slow...	2014-06-14	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A33WLY8BVHYXZU	Kedar Deshpande	"The Wire reaffirmed my faith in television as a legitimate artistic medium.The Wire is not only socially-relevant and important, but also brilliantly acted and written. The complexity of each character makes it difficult to make easy distinctions between ""good"" and ""bad,"" which is a remarkable feat in any medium (be it tv, film or literature), and even more remarkable given the polarized times that we live in, and network television's tendency to ""dumb-down"" shows with overt-dialog, flashy editing and melodramatic background music. The Wire's enormously-detailed story fills in the nitty-gritty aspects of criminal justice and doesn't overlook the tedium, uncertainty and difficulty of actually bringing someone to court AND pinning charges on them---this is crucial, given the one-dimensional, fits-in-a-perfect-box, glossed-over, formulaic nature of most network cop and court shows.One stand-out character is Omar (Michael K. Williams), the Robin Hood-esque vigilante who robs drug dealers. Omar's understated, sophisticated dialogs and clear-eyed morality (despite his chosen ""profession"") make him a classic character, in addition to a complex one. One can't call him a ""good"" guy as he operates outside the law and has no loyalties. His character is representative of the complexity and brilliance to which The Wire aspires---other shows would forgo such a character, in favor of simpler dichotomies between good and bad, cop and druglord. Omar represents a bizarre middle-ground, and one that no doubt actually DOES exist in the real world of the urban drug trade.D'Angelo (Larry Gillard Jr.), a ""lieutenant""-grade drug dealer, also shines as a portrait of a conflicted, tortured individual. He recognizes the violence and immorality of his job, and questions it continually; he makes mistakes, but accepts his punishments as a form of penance, which is in-line with his sense of right and wrong. He is a drug dealer, but one who abhors violence and has a melancholic, near-nihilistic philosophy about his own life, even while he encourages other youths around him to shun the drug trade.Season One of The Wire is a masterpiece. It frustrates the viewer without providing easy answers; at the same time, it is realistic and honest because of its attention to the harsh truths of the world. In real life, not everything works out perfectly. The Wire recognizes this grim fact and turns it into a riveting, artistic, heartbreaking examination of urban poverty, criminal justice, politics, drugs and race.The Wire is simply unprecedented and stunning."	5.0	Masterpiece of the visual arts	2006-09-16	21	19	2

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3E5OY3YLZMOA9	"Keith A. Jones ""Sonic Jones... I'm Kind Of A ..."	Unlike the Amzon.com editorial review I don't think the wire hooks you after the first episode, actually I think it's like that with both the first and second season. The beginning episodes actually may turn some people off of it but you have to keep watching. Everybody starts out swearing way too much, I mean they can't go three regular words without swearing and your trying to figure out why the cast looks so dumb and why you can barely understand them. You have to push yourself through the first couple episodes to get to the real quality episodes and that's when you're hooked. Not only the cast does a great job but also the writers did a great job of basically knowing Baltimore in and out. They have the slang, the accents, the attitudes, and the gritty drug and political wars right on point. I've been to Baltimore myself but I have never seen the other side of it and that's where it all goes down.The Wire shows the intelligence of Baltimore crime and the fearlessness of all the little soldiers doing the top dogs dirty work on the good guys side and bad guys side. The acting is real and it is so good that they make you believe that they're the characters they're playing. You sure won't find a love story in the wire because everybody wants money, respect, and respect. The story is great because you don't truly know who's good and who's bad like Stringer Bell played by Idris Elba who is the right hand man of Avon Barksdale, Barksdale is basically running Baltimore's drug dealing and all the crime possible. In reality Avon would have been caught if it wasn't for Stringer who is a genius, he goes to school for business and takes all the dirty money and makes it untraceable by buying all the property he can. The funny thing though is that none of the property is in either Avon or Stringer's name so if they ever get caught nobody can touch it.In a way you could say that Stringer is a street savior because he's buying up property and making it black owned but the process of getting the money to do it is killing the young and old people in the community. Stringer is one of my favorite characters but my absolute favorite is Omar played by Michael Kenneth Williams. Now I have to admit he is a little hard to get used to especially when you find about his not so well kept secret, Ok I'll give you a hint, he went to jail and got out liking not having a girlfriend. Omar is also sort of like a street savior because he's one of the worst types of stick up kids you could ever run into. He robs the drug dealers and he takes everything possible. Plus Omar is the cat that gives that extra gun slinging action to the series because he fears no one and even crazier everybody fears him. The wire is a very addictive series and so I suggest watching it on a weekend and if the first few episodes turn you off a little please don't stop watching.	5.0	How Deep Can It Get	2006-10-11	5	4	1
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1KOE41Q2KFQY9	Keith Gowan	In the conversation of great TV dramas, this the wire is always mentioned...  Being a fan of MI-5, Deadwood, Treme, Peaky Blinders, and the like, I figured I might be rewarded by watching this series...So far, I've glided through the first series, and have embarked on the second (thanks to amazon prime video)...  It is a damn good show so far, well worth watching...  However, I've yet been convinced that it is better than the three I listed earlier...The first season storyline and characters are complex, yet easy enough to follow...  Characters, no matter how evil or good, are very well rounded and developed...  Bad guys aren't just bad, and good guys aren't saints... This gives depth to every story that unfolds...The second season seems to be a bit of a reset, I'm interested to see how it goes...  However, the change is so abrupt that I'm not compelled to watch it with any urgency...Anyway, it is well entertaining, and I'm likely to update this once I get a bit further into it...  Enjoy...	4.0	Good show, but a bit overhyped...	2014-06-02	0	0	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2KZQ6ZK98FSI7	"Keith Langkan ""kaivai"""	Maybe if I wachted this in its hey day it would be better. I moved to the Baltimore area a few years ago and heard so much about how great this was. I think all the good reviews are from this area just out of pity for how bad it is.  The acting is really bad. I mean, realllllly cheesy and bad.  That female cop scene in the first 15 minutes is so funny....its painful to think this was taken seriously.  Sorry, but save yourself some time and stay away from this really bad series.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3VXV68ALQSBC3	Keith Solademi	I have seen many episodes of many TV shows in my life. This show immediately got my attention with an involved episode that doesn't try to dumb things down. This show demonstrates that the writers and produces assume that their watchers are actually  paying attention to what's going on, and not just gabbing it up with their buds on twitter or facebook (or even *gasp* in real life). There is quality writing, and attention to detail; I appreciate that.	4.0	A Cut Above	2012-02-18	6	6	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1EO8SHMUUAGI3	Kella	I bought &#34;The Wire&#34; because my holiday guest was a big fan.  After watching six episodes, I found that there are no sympathetic characters to be found in the storyline.  Even the &#34;good guys&#34; are rotten individuals, breaking the same laws the bad guys break. it all comes down to a game between rival gangs.  One gang is the ugly mass of thugs on the streets, and the other gang is the ugly mass of thugs who carry badges. i felt that I needed a shower after watching this nasty trip into the world of degenerate low-lifes.That being said, the cast is heavily sprinkled with extremely talented actors, such as idris Elba, who shine brightly when given  better roles to play.	2.0	Disgusted by it all	2013-12-31	7	2	5

Since I'm pretty much up to date on all the newly available TV shows. I'm doing some backtracking and watching past TV series that I originally missed out on.  I remember hearing excellent reviews when The Wire was first broadcast on HBO and decided to start viewing from the beginning.I will admit that I was somewhat unimpressed while viewing the first couple of episodes of season 1.  A lot of characters are thrown at you and the plot is not yet developed.  I'm glad I decided to hang in there because I was definitely hooked by the middle of the season 1 episodes. I actually ordered season 2 before I finished season 1.I highly recommend season 1 of The Wire.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1RA80SDLLIX1F	K. Park	"I'm late to the party, I know.  I had heard about The Wire, how it was critically received and what a great show it was.  I just wasn't interested in early 2000s and now I am sorely regretting that decision.  I just finished the first season and I am just starting the second one and this is probably the -best- show I have ever seen on television.  I give HBO huge props for getting this show renewed over and over despite the ratings so people like me can watch it and awe at the brilliance of the show.  I admit, I'm a kind of procedural junkie...I grew up on Law & Order and loved watching cop shows..even popcorn junks like Bones and CSI.  This blows them all out of the water.  It's gritty, funny, heartbreaking, intelligent and bittersweet at times.  You love and hate the characters on the show because they come across as real personalities, not just as the ""smart cop"" ""dumb cop"" ""good cop"" ""bad cop"" etc.  Whether it's realistic?  I can't say, but these characters come across as more real than some of the actual people on those reality shows.I can't say enough praise about this show.  They say the best show of 2012 was Homeland and I got the first season for that show and after watching the first episode, went right back to watching The Wire.  I am not sure whether I can return to watching TV again (well until Breaking Bad comes back) after this.Caution though: This is NOT an action packed show.  There is -a lot- of fast dialogues that you can miss easily if you're not paying attention and well... there're just a lot of talking in general.  It's also not episodic so you either watch the whole thing or you don't at all.  The drama is very subtle. There are few screaming, few crying, no dramatic lines preceded by dramatic turn in the music, slow-mo cam zooming into important scenes so you know this is *important* etc.  Basically, it doesn't treat you like you're dumb.  It's like a long novel that is put together visually piece by piece and some of the lines are just absolute zingers. If you are not into that, I would not suggest it.Oh and this has very -bad- language.  Like profanity and stuff.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2J39IZVKURPFW	Kyle Prince	"""The Wire"" may not be the first cop show to ditch the one-case-per-week standard for one season-long case (""24"" is), but it's the best. Just like a great novel, ""The Wire""'s plot and characterizations unfold gradually (13 episodes) and in great detail, with a more satisfying ending than can be achieved by telling a whole story in just one hour. My only complaint is that the resolution is rushed. They should have taken two episodes to present everything in the last one. It almost ceratainly is the first cop show to give equal time to the bad guys. Both cops and bad guys on ""The Wire"" commit deplorable and heroic acts. Much like Tony Soprano, Baltimore drug lord Avon Barksdale is at times an admirable businessman. Particularly early on he shows a knack for inspiring loyalty and confidence in his employees in a way that would make organizational psychologists proud. It sure doesn't stay pretty all the time, though. Episode 12's climax, the potential inside job hit on a young employee, may be the most gut-wrenching and terrifying moment in television's history. The dialogue on ""The Wire"" is sharp, poignant, hilarious and always authentic. Most of the acting is terrific. Standouts are Andre Royo as Bubbles, a druggie informant with a heartbreaking tale of addiction; and Larry Gilliard, Jr. as D'Angelo, the morally conflicted nephew of Avon."	5.0	A Televised Novel	2007-09-18	3	3	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1LXCDZLAIKH4V	lakeqi	I watch five episodes of this show waiting for something to happen. Nothing ever did.I mean NOTHING.This show is SO STUPID. The best example of how stupid this show is can be show with one scene. Two detectives go into an old crime scene to investigate it to see if the previous investigation missed something. They take out their tape measures and sharpies and start measuring and marking. During this inspection no other word is uttered but the f bomb. One cop seems to discover something and he drops it, the other cop does the same, back and forth for like five minutes. Its not the language that disturbs me at all, its just that the scene itself totally bombs becasue its so stupid. The whole show is like that. The gangster who teaches his underlings the rules of chess, oh that bit totally flopped. I kept waiting for it to get better, maybe it does, but one things for sure, I didn't have to wait five episodes for Deadwood, Boardwalk Empire or the Tudors to get good. Watch this show only if you want to see if I'm telling the truth, but for gods sake, don;t buy it, its terrible.	1.0	A giant emptiness	2013-07-24	63	8	55

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ	Larry Scantlebury	"I don't think this is the best show on TV. I still reserve that for 24. And I don't think this is the best that HBO has done. I still hold out for ""Band of Brothers.""But ""The Wire"" is so close that you may not be able to tell the difference. Wire has great acting. Obviously, Domic West is fantastic as the self-abusive but brilliant and committed Det. McNulty. But the supporting cast is equally extraordinary. Andre Royo as the on-again off-again snitch/heroin addict does such a perfect job you believe you're on the street with him. I mean 'on the street.' And Sonja Sohn as Greggs, the gay, compassionate, tough undercover cop is equally up to the task, talking the talk and walking the walk.It lacks the breathlessness of 24 in the sense that each episode does not leave you gasping. On the other hand, there's an aspect of 24 that's incredible. You can believe that characters 'would' act that way given the circumstances. It's just that the circumstances seem unrealistic. Not so with ""The Wire."" You're right in there in a Pelecanos or Lehane novel - two of the writers on ""The Wire"" by the way, overhearing the street talk and feeling the heat. Brilliant stuff for television. This is what TV should have been doing all along, instead of the garbage they put on ABC, CBS and NBC. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury"	5.0	Gritty.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2LG4G2VDWSFLJ	L. B. Guernsey	"A friend of mine recommended this series with those words, ""Best cop show ever"" and he is right.  Amazingly intelligent writing and plot, every episode builds on the last and even more into season 2.  Although a gritty crime series, parts of this are hilarious, especially when you know the personalities involved. When McNulty sticks it to his boss by a pure display of brilliant detective work done with the secondary purpose of embarrassing the department brass, I felt like cheering.The language here is very rough, but the series transcends it.  There was one completely brilliant scene, where two detectives do Sherlock Holmes-caliber detective work on an old crime scene using only photos and a tape measure, and the only dialog for the extended 5 minute scene is ""F***"" and occasionally ""Motherf***"", yet it worked perfectly.  A work of genius."	5.0	Best cop show ever	2005-04-13	7	7	0

It was really a groundbreaking show, and you can see the influence in a lot of highly regarded series that came afterwards (like Breaking Bad).

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2KRK4F93OKLEM	Liza Barksdale	"As you can see, the majority of reviews here are overwhelmingly positive.  It is, in my opinion, the most intelligent, rewarding, and entertaining television show of all time.If you decide to watch this series, a couple of pieces of advice: (1) start at the beginning.  More than any other show (even any other HBO show), you will be lost if you don't.  Or if you're not completely lose, you're at least unwittingly cheating yourself out of *so* much. (2) Be patient.  This is like a novel and they're setting a whooooole lot of things up, so if you're the type of person who puts down a 500-page book if you don't like the first 25 pages--this show is *not* for you.  I'd say 3 episodes to really get going.As an aside, I think any negative reviews can be explained by either (1) lack of patience/lack of interest in a show in which you really have to invest yourself [this show simply requires more from the viewer than other shows], or (2) lack of interest in realistic television [yeah, it's gritty, for sure... a ""warts and all"" view of things).  ""The Wire"" doesn't just deal with sexy topics or glamorous untouchable characters--it's about crime and violence and racial politics and decaying American industrial cities and the disappearing blue collar middle class and trying to do ""good"" in the face of overwhelming odds and family in all of its incarnations, and a *whole* lot more.So many other reviews discussed the phenomenal writing, acting, and overall production quality, but those deserve a mention, too.Seriously.  If you give it a chance, ""The Wire"" might just change your life (or at least your perspective).  I always thought that kind of a statement was ridiculous hyperbole (it's TV, for cryin' out loud), but then I saw this show."	5.0	Start with Season One... prepare for your world to be rocked...	2006-08-06	11	11	0

Each season has its specific focus, although the main characters stay in place. The Wire has a lot to say about a number of social problems, such as poverty, race, drugs, The Drug War, the legal system, public schools, the press. But The Wire handles these with subtlety and depth, rather than the finger waggling and posturing of Oz. There are not really heroes and villains in this version of Bodymore, Murderland. But there are plenty of unforgettable characters, heartbreak, even some laughter, and always the game.	5.0	Finally, The Wire for streaming!	2014-07-10	1	1	0

The way the show is written is very tactful of life in an urban environment. It depicts every aspect with great detail and attention, which is something most shows don't do.  I'm pleased with where this show takes us each season and I can't wait for season four.  Every actor and actress earns an award from this show in my book,  much love to my boy Wood Harris Chicago's Own for doing his thing.  All I can say to The Wire is keep up the good work and to all of you who love so-called reality shows they have nothing on The Wire.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3BS1XXE0Z8IT8	L. Talbot	"Finally! We are getting the DVDs.I can't say much more than anyone else already has about how truly remarkable ""The Wire"" is. It is, hands down, the best show on television. Ever. Thoughtful, intelligent, gripping storylines; imperfect, at times villainous, yet utterly compelling characters; and a critical, unflinching, yet oddly empathetic view of the city, its inhabitants, and the flawed bureaucracies that keep the wheels turning. The highest compliment I can pay ""The Wire"" is that it is the only show I have ever seen that actually respects the intelligence of its viewers. No, it does not make things easy for us. There are no standard TV devices such as flashbacks, awkward expository dialogue, or stock characters mouthing predictable, socially relevant drivel that ""educate"" us as to the creators' intentions - instead, we get pure, unadulterated story that dares us to make sense of everything ourselves and forces us to form our own opinions and conclusions instead of having them spoon-fed to us. It is a brilliant, brilliant effort, and although it is - typically - underpromoted and underappreciated by HBO, I'm kind of glad about that. I'd hate to see what would happen if stupid people got ahold of it and forced the writers to dumb things down to accommodate them. I'd prefer to keep this show a little secret among smart viewers rather than have it get ruined by too much attention.So, if you're a dumb person please ignore this review and go watch Law & Order. But if you're intelligent, inquisitive, and a good judge of quality TV - what the hell are you waiting for?? WATCH THIS SHOW."	5.0	It's About Time!	2004-10-05	20	17	3

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A26ZSYRPA1TCI5	Marc Dalesandro	"Others have written long positive reviews, so instead of going on about how great The Wire is, I'll just focus on one member of the fictional cop ""cast""...Jimmy McNulty.Now I am of the opinion that the best TV cop of all time is/was Andre Braugher's Frank Pembleton, of Homicide fame. That belief was unchallenged until detective McNulty came along.Although his character was slightly watered-down in later seasons of The Wire, Season 1 introduces us to this driven detective in all his uncompromising glory. Witness a police detective that allows nothing to interfere with his single-minded pursuit of justice. Like a doberman with a juicy bone, McNulty is dogged and relentless. He circumvents the chain of departmental command, annoys fellow officers, treats partners poorly, breaks the rules, and refuses to compromise. He's arrogant, self-righteous, a binge drinker, an adulterer, a drunk driver, and a general all-around jerk.But if he's on the case, you'd better believe it's going down. He'll put his own young children in danger to make certain of it.McNulty is a mad dog in the Baltimore police department.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AKED1F1X262O5	"Marc S. Shiman ""Marc"""	I didn't start watching The Wire when it was airing. Instead, I caught HBO's On Demand episodes. It took me two goes before I got into it - beware, this is not like anything you'll see anywhere else on TV. The first couple of episodes of the first season are slow... and complicated.Then... you start to get it. And there is no getting away from it. A lot of people have compared it here with 6 Feet Under and the Sopranos; its a completely different thing. Much more of a real slice of life of the urban environment than the other two shows, and in my opinion considerably more intelligent.I'll let the other reviewers give the praise - incredibly well developed characters, both bad guys and good. All the good guys have flaws, all the bad guys are likeable in their own way. No big name actors, but the acting is great with the occasional exception.Why you need the DVD - this show has a LOT of characters to keep straight. The language isn't always easy to follow. This is the one show you WILL watch again and again. And you will pick up all sorts of subtleties the second, third and fourth times through the series.Buy this DVD. Make sure you have some time. Stick with it even if you are struggling in the beginning. And then become hooked.And watch out for Omar - the guy who steals from the drug dealers routinely steals the scenes.	5.0	A must for DVD	2004-08-30	14	13	1

Made it a little easier.  Still, I'm glad I bought them.  Great show, great characters, great acting and too true.	5.0	One of the best shows ever to be on TV	2014-01-18	1	0	1

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A18ZP8SFD2VC3A	Mariel	The writers/directors for this series are pure genius. No one is all good or all bad, or cookie cutter, or impossibly perfect like so many of the other TV / book / movie characters. The characters in The Wire are complex, edgy, interesting. The storyline is well told, fascinating and believable. You don't just get told the story, you can feel it from the perspective of all the different characters involved.Hands down, the best dramatic series I have ever watched.	5.0	Best. Writing.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2D37EP9KT2E3D	"Mark bennett ""Mark"""	"This is a really well written crime show. Or more accurately a video novel for television. TV is full of shows about crime and the police, but its all mostly melodrama for children. The first season of ""the wire"" is a dense show full of realistic characters and offers a tremendous view into the politics of a large modern American city. And it gives its due to both sides of the law. It gives as much insight into the housing project drug trade as it does to police, prosecutors, politics and the courts. We see a single case evolve over the course of a season. We see the arbitrary nature of how/why law enforcement decisions are made. We see the politics of law enforcement and we see the ""politics"" of the drug trade at housing projects.I ignored this show for a long time because I was so tired of law&order; and the various CSIs. Television, for a while, was full of trivial crime drama. But this is different. Its such a great standalone work that its almost a shame that it didn't end with one season."	5.0	Excellent crime drama	2010-08-02	4	3	1

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AA65NGFXUCR33	"Mavman ""Nykat"""	"The Wire, is the realist cop show on TV, bar none. The depth of the character's engrosses the viewer and straying from the traditional standard of TV storytelling gives this show the realness that most shows lack. The line between good and bad is very thin as the ""heroes"" tend to be flawed and the ""villians"" have many charismatic traits. Also, the show delves into the politics of any and all idealistic instituions (i.e. law enforcement, politics and working class America etc.) and exposing the human factor which displays the good and bad of all organizations, which makes for a very thought provoking viewing experience.This is not an easy watch, where it all is clear within one episode, but as you watch repeatedly and more episodes, you are thoroughly engaged by the incredible writing, imagery and especially the powerful acting performances.The Wire is best suited for DVD so one can really understand through watching over and over and can make for great discussion as groups interpret and analyze the show."	5.0	The realist show on TV	2004-08-31	10	9	1

I watched episode 1, started to think my fears were going to come true (said to myself ""this doesn't seem that amazing""). Watched episode 2, became more convince my fears were true (said to myself ""this still doesn't seem very amazing... where's the mind blowing-ness?"")... then I went out for the afternoon and kept thinking about the show. And kept thinking about it. And kept thinking about it. And realized... what other show do I continue to think about for hours after I'm done watching? Almost none is the answer. So I got home and watched another episode. Over the next two days I watched the entire season.Not a let down in any way, shape, or form. Everyone says you should watch this? There's a darned good reason for that. This show is one of the most compelling and well written stories I've ever come across in TV, movies, or books... period. I can't say much more that hasn't been said by the 242 reviews which precede this one, so I'll just re-iterate that you should watch this show. Having fully expected to be let down, having had the bar set so high there was no way I could see the show actually reaching those heights... I was proven completely wrong. It's one of those very, very rare things that not only lives up to the insane hype but then surpasses it and turns you into yet another evangelist.Buy these DVDs.

So, years later I finally checked out the show on DVD and while it may not be the best show on TV...it's certainly the most realistic police drama I've ever come across.The Wire shows two complex sides in downtown Baltimore.  On one end we have the task force of ""losers"" set up by the police to bring down kingpin drug dealer Avon Barksdale.  On the other side we have Barksdale's entire operation and the gritty life of dealer and junkie on the street.The show resonates with reality.  The scenes and dialogue between the street dealers is very powerful and just looking at the slums...that has to be what it is really like.  The police characters on ""the wire detail"" cover all areas and none are portrayed as black and white.A friend asked me to compare The Wire to The Shield.  I'd say The Shield is the better show if you're looking for a fast paced action drama.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AIW2KMRZUAGEP	M Keith Presley	This is easily one of the best written police dramas of the modern era.  Groundbreaking writing combined with stellar performances from the cast come together to give us a modern classic.  When The Wire originally aired on HBO, I was unable to watch it for various reasons, and had always wanted to.  I recently was finally able to start my Amazon Prime subscription, and this was my first purchase.  I know the show had a strong following and I am a fan that is very late to the party, but I was instantly hooked.  Without a doubt, I will purchase the other seasons as soon as I can.  I already have season two queued up.  It is a fantastic budget for the price.The thing that makes the writing so good is the realism.  I grew up with a police officer father, and went on to work at the department myself.  My father is long retired, and I am now as well.  It is clearly obvious to anyone that has lived inside the culture that one of the writers was someone who experienced it from the inside.  (Do your research, I do not want to clutter my review with too much detail!)  The nuances the people behind the badge struggle through life with, the various stress and how they deal (or don't deal) with it, the day to day battles, the way the job becomes a political game as you get higher up the chain of command - it's all there.  Beyond the stark realism, it is just plain well done.  Beyond the details about life as within the police force, the street life of Baltimore is captured perfectly.  They had input from people who lived the life and did their research.  Every facet of life is captured in great detail.  Excellent writing that is very entertaining.Coupled with the top-notch writing is the acting.  Across the board the performances were incredible.  You have since seen many of the cast go on to do other highly lauded roles, many of them in future HBO shows.  I cannot really single out one actor.  Seriously.  In my opinion a lot of this is the writing.  In my experience, as long as the actor has skill, it is hard to make good writing bad.  Writing this good is quite frankly hard to screw up.  HBO is not one to scrimp money, so you know they got top tier talent.  Good talent and good writing is a guaranteed home run almost every time.If you like gritty, realistic drama, especially police crime drama, this is a must see.  No spoilers here, I will just say - after season one, I cannot wait to see the rest of the show.  Five stars out of five.	5.0	Fantastic gritty crime drama!	2014-04-10	2	2	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A12XRHXJRFNKPT	"M. M. Davis ""Matt Davis"""	The Wire is utterly outstanding. I'm not a big fan of the theme music, but that's really the only complaint I can come up with. The characters are multi-dimensional and cover a broad sociological spectrum. The plotting is intricate, well-paced and subtle. The dialogue is very well-written, and the no-name actors who are delivering it do as good a job as any cast I've seen.None of the seasons that follow are quite as good as Season 1. They are all very good, but it's almost like going to a reunion concert for a blockbuster rock group. It's great to have the band back together, but the energy is inevitably different the second time around.If you've got a spare 13 hours, and are looking to fill it with some high-quality TV from the HBO/Prime catalog, this is definitely the place to start. I'm a big fan of HBO's series, and I really think this is the best one.	5.0	As good as TV gets	2014-06-26	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2WEDFOLI2H651	Moises	I dare anyone to watch the first 2 or 3 episodes of The Wire without wanting to watch the entire series from season 1 thru 5. This show is riveting and I find it hard to believe it has not won any awards. Any one that watches the show loves it, but its amazing how many people never heard of it because it was never won anything, at least nothing I am aware of. It is a gritty crime drama that shows the struggle between the Baltimore Police and the drug pushers in the projects. What makes this show realistic is that there is no clear good guys or bad guys. The characters are all human. From the cops and politicians to the Kingpins and their rock slinging street thug employees...all the characters in the show have their vices and their sense of a moral code. Sometimes the good guys have to play dirty to get an advantage on the Criminals, and sometimes the criminals show a surprising amount of heart, honor, and even good citizenship in many cases. It does a good job of showing there is a lot more complexity to street crime then just good guys vs bad guys.	5.0	I dare you!	2013-02-06	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1EKT54ENX6YWM	"MovieMom46 ""Lola"""	"I am currently watching the first and second episodes of ""The Wire"" to which I rented strictly because of the rave reviews here on Amazon.  I am having a hard time understanding the charactures because there is so much slang I may have to turn on english subtitles.  If this is a true to life account of how law enforcement and crime happens in Baltimore, remind me never to visit.  I live in T-Town, (Tacoma) the drive-by capitol of the world as we are called and there is a fraction of the crime like on that show here, yet our state government takes care of our law enforcement system with modern equipment and crime labs and educational resources for forensic and fingerprint, trace evidence....etc training.  With the amount of crime in Baltimore and other eastern cities with a high crime rate, you would think they would put that high on their priority list,,,,, Common, no computers?

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1MOGEXNCBZE3U	"M. Packham ""Stuart"""	The tagline of this series is 'listen carefully'. Indeed, that couldn't be more apt. What with the preponderance of characters, the street-smart 'ear' of the dialogue and the lack of typical 'get-up-to-speed' moments, I had to watch this with the subtitles on just so I could keep up.After what some may perceive as a slow first episode, this series sweeps you away with its slew of characters and storylines. Its realism prevents the series from ever taking the easy way out, and with its focus on both the drug-dealing end as well as the narcotics squad end, we learn that no one side has it easy and both come up against opposing forces from within. The cops are ruled by a political hierarchy and judicial red-tape; the drug-dealers are ruled by opposing dealers, CI snitches and the constant need to reshuffle their operations to stay ahead of the police.Perhaps the most appealing feature of this show is that there's no 'shocks' in the 'Sopranos' or 'Shield' nature of the word. There's hardly any violence, and all of the 'action' comes from the incendiary dialogue between the characters. There's a lot of bad language and drug abuse, but certainly nothing gratuitous.What must be remembered is that it takes a few episodes to really get into. Pay close attention to the dialogue and make sure you don't miss anything. If you give it the start it deserves, you won't be disappointed.	5.0	Amazing.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3ANMRSZYKFYMR	mp mcgrath	One of the few DVD sets that I own. Hands down the best effort ever put forth on the medium of television. The first season could stand alone as a great novel brought to the small screen, but you will be hooked and watch the entire five season series. The first season deals primarily with a drug dealing organization in Baltimore and a police unit which is tasked to investigate said drug dealers, however, the length of the series allows the in depth exploration of the criminal justice/court system, the politicians, the municipal education institutions, and the newspapers that cover it all - set against the backdrop of a decaying, although sometimes gentrifying Baltimore. Every police officer, criminal, politician, bureaucrat, newspaperman, judge, attorney, or student will appreciate the absolute truths and realism presented in this series...and you'll have to watch at least three times to see everything. Great characters and acting, unbelievably accurate dialogue, and attention grabbing plot arcs that will make the viewer binge watch to the exclusion of personal hygiene...yeah - it's that good.	5.0	The Wire	2014-03-25	1	1	0

Rwebangira	It's a little bit of a cliche to declare &#34;The Wire&#34; the best show of all time, but I am one of those who think the title is well deserved. The thing is, I didn't really think much of it the first time I saw it. I am convinced that this is one of those shows whose popularity exploded on DVDs because you have to see the whole thing (or at least all of the first couple of seasons) before you can start to appreciate it and realize this is not  just another formulaic police drama. What distinguishes &#34;The Wire&#34; is intense realism, lack of pandering to the audience and sociological examination of every aspect of a cities crime problem. It is clearly a show written with an ambitious artistic purpose (a purpose that in my opinion is mostly successfully achieved): To try to portray many different aspects of an American city and how the different institutions and people within those institutions interact with each other and why this often leads to things not getting better. It manages to do all this while giving due space for character development and creating some very compelling entertainment. I think this is the essential American TV show that anyone seeking to understand something about inner cities, the illegal drug trade and institutional urban politics in the 21st century needs to watch.	5.0	The Best TV Show of all time	2014-06-03	0	0	0

You will never hear hackneyed terms line &#34;the perp&#34; or &#34;the vic&#34;.  The cops work in real, under budgeted, technologically stone aged crap holes not beautifully lit glass environments with ridiculously advanced computer technology (btw, that's all animation on CSI folks .. you work on computers or you wouldn't be reading this .. your software doesn't work like that because there is no such software).

But many other people here have said that.What they may NOT have said is that this DVD set contains terrible, unwelcome spoilers.  To view an episode, one must click on an episode, then click ""watch episode"" AGAIN on a screen where a plot synopsis is splashed across the screen.  I had to train myself to close my eyes each time that I wanted to watch the show.  My wife had one of the major surprises of season one blown for her because she accidentally selected one episode in the future and read the first sentence of the plot description.The set's clearly fine for those who are seeing the show the second time around, but those seeing it the first time should be warned.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AGVWTYW0ULXHT	"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S..."	This is great stuff.  I can't really add to what others have said here, except to say that this is definitely a series to watch.  It's got everything you'd want from a crime drama like CSI, but much more.  The characters are interesting: nobody fits an easy stereotype, and no one is simply a good guy or a bad guy.  There are several overlapping story arcs, but they all fit together in a complex puzzle.  There are hints of many much larger storylines that could be followed up on, but aren't -- it has the feel of a world, the world of Baltimore, unfolding on its own, and we happen to be given a glimpse of some of the interconnected lives of a few investigators  and the ones they are investigating.  But their lives are set against a backdrop of politicians, lawyers, a changing climate in America after 9/11, and much more.I'd heard so many good things about this series but never had a chance to see it -- now that I've seen season one and am halfway through season two, I am hooked and will be watching through to the end.  There's something about television done right that enables an experience you can't get from film -- stories that begin and end and of other stories that pick up where they leave off; a real sense of character growth that doesn't feel artificial, contrived to fit into a 2 hour window; also the feeling for continuity in character and places, of something unfolding over time.  This is television done right, and it is rare and exciting to see it.  Definitely a show to watch (if you aren't put off by the heavy language, some sexuality, heavy drug-related content, and violence - this is R rated television).	5.0	Engrossing television -- rich characterizations, complex and exciting storytelling, strong visual sense	2008-12-18	1	1	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AS1SLYZEGPJ02	Nathan A. White	"In terms of fictional series, HBO is the only real reason to own a television set.The Wire is the best of the HBO Original Series. And the most underappreciated. The only criticism one may have of The Wire is that it is too complicated. But in actuality, I think this is The Wire's best selling point. It's a rarity in television to find a series that compels the viewer to rise to the level of the writing instead of the typical lowering of the writing's quality to dumb it down to attract the most mass appeal to sell ad slots. That's the beauty of HBO - you've bought the service, so you get what you pay for or cancel your subscription. HBO is not targeting the unwashed masses to sell ads, it puts out quality television to attract subscribers. It's a beautiful system that I believe (you heard it here first) will someday become the norm in cable television (channel-by-channel subscription with no advertising).HBO's format raises the quality and The Wire epitomizes the beauty of this system the most of all HBO Original Series. The plot is so complicated, so multi-layered that I keep watching over and over just to make sure I get it all. I feel that I am failing as a human being if I don't do The Wire justice and get the whole plot line straight. You can't criticize the Wire for being too complicated; it's quite refreshing to have a television show that challenges me as the viewer instead of spoon feeds me.In 1961, FCC Chairman Newton R.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	The formula of cops and crooks dramas are almost as old as television itself, but upon watching the first episode of HBO's the Wire, you'll be astonished at how fresh it feels.  After watching all 13 episodes of this first season set, you won't be amazed by the sheer intricacy of the Wire's storytelling, you'll be floored.  Taking place in inner city Baltimore, we are introduced to Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West) as he enters into a world of drug deals and death, with Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris) seemingly in the middle of it all.  As each episode goes on, things become more complex, so much in fact, that there are twists and turns you'll never see coming, but this strangely addictive HBO drama will keep you thirsty for more.  Created by veteran crime reporter David Simon and featuring one of the finest ensemble casts ever assembled in television history, the Wire is everything you've heard the hype about and more.  Of course, the praise lavished upon the Wire far from serves it justice, you must see it for yourself.	5.0	Words can't do the Wire justice	2005-03-02	9	8	1

It is refreshing to see a show that has a target audience above -- well, somewhere above elementary school level  The characters are raw and fresh.  The story line is engaging.  Has everything a good crime drama should have.  Interesting combination of relaxed and tense at the same time.  Don't know how else to put it.  I have been told it only gets better as you go through the series. I have rarely had so many friends and family give a show glowing reviews.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AKUTWZY4ASO8W	New Era	Wasn't expecting the show to be much more than a ghetto thug show. After seeing an interview with one of the past actors I decided to watch an episode....and loved it. The acting was actually acting and not emotionless reading. It is easy to hate and like the same character rooting for them and yet hoping they fail at the same time.Grey is the ruling moral shade because you either do the &#34;gotting or get got&#34;. Both the &#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad&#34; guys land in gray leaning towards black but the magic of this series is that you feel for the characters.It also helps that at it's bleakest moment when it's just a depressing show we get a funny or warm moment.It made me wonder if i didn't grow up how I did if I would have ended up in the constant struggle between doing the right thing and wanting to survive and support my family. We can say no I would never but realistically speaking hunger clouds judgement, so until that moment of hunger comes I do not know what I would do.	5.0	Loving It!!	2014-06-20	1	1	0

Hogan	I had seen a couple of episodes of season three and decided to buy season one, start out from the beginning and find out what this show was all about.  What I quickly realized was that this one of the best shows I had ever seen.  I watch the Shield and I've seen NYPD Blue and Law & Order the CSI's and what I'm saying is that this is easily the best cop show out there.  I was unaware of this when I first started watching was that another great Baltimore cop show, Homicide: Life on the Streets, were both created and written by the same guy, David Simon.  What is really cool is that they get a lot of fairly unknown actors or even amateurs to play big roles for this show, and that it works.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3U0M0456YPLT1	"Nilmar ""M"""	This is a story about the dark underbelly of our society. It presents the perspective of children growing up in the ruins of our failed attempts at public housing and public warehousing (uhm i mean education). Uneducated, no skills, no future we are then somehow surprised when the children turn to drugs and gangs. Prisons are the finishing schools for this segment of our society. And the police who try to cope with the fallout. The sense of frustration, the corruption and the total lack of anything resembling a plan come across loud and clear. Note that many local people played as actors and extras in the production.I've worked on the construction portion of attempting to renovate a few public housing sites and this story condenses many things which i have personally seen and experienced.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A511UTYJBZKMC	OEO	The weird thing about The Wire, especially this first season, that one might not expect from the not undeserved but yet often breathless reviews, is that it is both funny, fast-paced, and entertaining, even while being important in all the ways the critics rightly wax over. One finds needed moments of humor throughout, in every setting and subgroup examined, that provide key moments of levity when we can't help but find ourselves struggling with the weighty issues the show pieces through: Race, poverty, the African American struggle, blood friendship, etc. (Omar, one of the show's best & most original characters, plays a large-than-life role in that provision.)  And yes, the action honchos amongst us will also find lots things to love here: After all, the show's premise fundamentally deals with bloody drug conflicts between gang members, and the Baltimore &#34;po-lice&#34; we get to know and love, and whose mission is to topple a key protagonist's burgeoning empire, are nothing but willing to crack a few heads.  And finally, when our hearts yearn for something softer, we find no shortage of endearing moments as well: My favorite examples are two detectives' brotherly friendship, one which surpasses the bounds of race, as well as other key mentorships between uncle and cousin, boss and soldier, brother and not-quite-kin. All in all, one might say David Simon managed to do the impossible here: Provide a little something for everyone, while never straying towards the trite thus unmoving nonsense one so often finds in run-of-the-mill police procedurals. Yes, indeed&#8212;this show deserves your appraisal.	5.0	"The thinking man's ""action movie"""	2014-05-29	0	0	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A70YTUFJY5HXN	Olukayode Balogun	"Living as I do, in the backwater known as the United Kingdom (God save the Queen), series one of ""The Wire"" only just had it's network premiere in January 2005 on the FX channel. I'd heard a lot about the series and had even caught an episode or two while vacationing in Atlanta back in the spring of 2002. Even then, I knew that this series was so intense, I would need to see it from episode one through to the finale, to really know and appreciate what it was all about.Well, I wasn't wrong. After two episodes I knew there was no way on earth I was waiting 13 weeks to see how this one panned out and this DVD box set is probably the best thing I've ever bought yet, no exaggeration. I watched three episodes a night and within a week, I was hungry for more. David Simon and his crew and cast are nothing short of geniuses and I have never seen TV with such intelligent writing and realistic character development. I cannot wait to get my hands on series two. It's back on TV in July but thanks to amazon (and my multi-regional DVD player) I don't have to wait until then.Oh, and I took additional pleasure in the knowledge that both Dominic West and Idris Elba are from this backwater known as the United Kindom (God save the Queen).

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	Reality bites. As one of the protagonists' mothers asks in the final episode of the season `what's right?' In Baltimore's narcotic investigation unit it is hard to say. Nearly everyone has a little dirt. Most of the bad guys were just born into doing what they do with no way out but to take a bullet or a stretch on the inside. Narcos bust for headlines to make rank. Dealers are in the game because they have no other way. Judges turn coat because it is election time, money goes missing, burnt out cops get wire tap equipment from the 1950s, computers are like gold and the body bags are mounting up. If you are not drinking then you are on the take. If you are on the take then the guilt of it runs home fast. Baltimore is falling apart and the worst thing about the drug war is that this label is all wrong... wars are something you can win.The show revolves around Det. Jimmy McNulty, good police who does things behind the backs of his superiors, gets dumped with a bad detail and slowly turns into it a career making case that threatens to rock everyone from the street dealer to Capitol Hill. Within the space of 13 episodes you watch how broken cops build a reliable unit out of nothing and they work the streets to build a case against a residential area's top hoods. This is great drama through and through.The Wire's got a lot of heart for telling it like it is and this is one of the reasons why this little known show often hits the top 10 best TV shows in the reviews. If it wasn't for the reviewers who know a good TV series when they see one, we wouldn't have a clue this was out there.  Who would have thought that a little unknown knocking around could be a contender? If you like good TV then chances are that you will eventually want to try a few episodes and who knows, you might get the wire bug.Pros:- Like the real deal- Solid police story, good balance of views- TV drama for menCons:- Only 13 episodes- Sometimes its low production values are apparent- Catering for male viewers and is not really viewing material for a couple.-  You might expect too much with the hype.	4.0	Law enforcement drama with a real edge	2008-10-04	4	3	1

It is a masterpiece and never have I used that word before when describing a television series, well maybe once in referring to the Sopranoes. It is the most complex, layered, piece of art that I think is better than any movie I have seen. It actually diminishes the Sopranoes, Six Feet Under and the rest of the prime series on television. It is in a class of its own. I have watched Season one once and plan to again. This series requires work on the part of the viewer, you have to go to the HBO site and refer to the cast of characters to understand. The language is difficult at first but after a while becomes poetic to the listener. I just cannot say how profound an effect this program has on the viewer. It is worth 10 times what I paid for it.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A26XCS3QLDJJWN	"Patrick G. Varine ""Make beats, not war, haha..."""	"""The Shield"" is now my gold-standard for cop drama. Relentless, fast-paced and great. HBO's ""The Wire"" is not nearly as breakneck as ""The Shield,"" but it is wholly engaging in a very different way.""The Wire"" draws you in slowly, putting the story together piece by piece as a detail of Baltimore police come together to target a West Baltimore dope dealer who has been operating under the radar. When one of the dealer's lieutenants beats a murder rap in court by intimidating witnesses, Det. Jimmy McNulty ends up griping to the case's judge about it. The judge complains to the higher-ups in the police department, and pretty soon everyone in the Baltimore PO-leece (as they pronounce it) is mad at McNulty for sticking his nose where it doesn't belong.On top of that, when the detail expands its focus to follow not just the drugs, but the money, the case's tentacles start to reach into some high places...What I enjoyed most was the way the show detailed the various workings of a wiretap operation. As one character puts it in the second season, to a detective who feels there isn't enough action on this case, ""We're putting people in jail using wiretaps and typewriters.""The show also takes a frank look at the West Baltimore drug trade -- ""In this town, what other crime is there?"" one detective asks -- from the higher-ups down to the street-level teenage dealers.The focus in particular on the young crews that actually slang dope was interesting. One storyline, which examines the way a baby slanger feels in the aftermath of having been responsible for the torture and death of a neighborhood rip-n-runner (a stick-up man who robs drug dealers) at the hands of his crew, is a pretty powerful tale.The show is chock full of memorable characters, from the suits who run McNulty's homicide unit who are pretty much totally concerned with the unit's clearance rate, to (I believe) Wendell Davis' portrayal of the hilarious and drunken Det. Bunk Moreland, McNulty's partner (there's one scene in which Moreland and McNulty, surprised at what they find in their recreation of a crime scene, use only the 'f' word for about five minutes.... hilarious), to Omar, a -- no joke -- homosexual rip-n-runner, who robs people with a shotgun, gets many of the series' funniest lines and somehow manages to inject some tenderness into a very icy character.The ending doesn't have the slam-bang excitement that a lot of other season finales do, but then again, it's probably more indicative of the way cases like this really do end: you don't nail everyone, and a lot of people walk away unhappy.It's very realistic, and still consistently very entertaining... a hard balance to strike, but HBO and creator David Simon have done it."	4.0	"Not quite ""The Shield,"" but engaging in a different way"	2006-05-02	10	7	3
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AUDSM2CTLLW1Q	Patrick L. Randall	"""The Wire"" is one of those truly great pieces of television cinema.  It's a show that, even in its weakest moments, still entertains, shocks and compels the viewer.  Baltimore is known for being the home of the Star Spangled Banner, the Orioles and Ravens, the great Harbor, Aquarium, and Science Center.  It's also known for its seedier side of rundown tenements which are fertile ground for rampant crime.  In a way that few other crime dramas have (Baltimore-based ""Homicide"" included), ""The Wire"" goes straight to the brutal core of the lives and motivations of the criminals, the police officers who are pursuing them and the politicians who may be hedging their bets with both.Season 1 sets the table masterfully as troubled detective, Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), learns about a shadowy drug organization called the `Barksdale Gang', so named after its leader, Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris).  Jimmy has numerous sources that keep him close enough to the street that he hears about this group that the rest of Baltimore PD hasn't not heard of (due to Barksdale's expert control of information).  After stirring up enough pots to get senior administration interested in taking down the crew, McNulty is assigned to a task force of seemingly screwed up, but enormously talented, street and investigative police officers.The series name is a reference to the wire taps (on land line phones and cellular phones) that the task force makes use of to get intel to work against Barksdale.  There are some great scenes involving how the criminal empire is structured,  how information is compartmentalized and how they manage to stay one step ahead of the cops (such as using temporary cell phones called `burners').In addition to the great narrative and background of ""The Wire"", this series also benefits from an astounding array of truly memorable characters, such Lester, Bunk, Bubbles, Senator Clay Harris (`sheeeeeeeeeeeet'), Prop Joe, Stringer Bell (Barksdale's second in command), and the ubiquitous free-agent stick up man, Omar (""Omar's Coming!!!"").Upon a first viewing, ""The Wire"" may seem to start off slow.  However, that is not a fault of the series writers.  It is simply a matter that there is so much information for the viewer to take in at first, in order to get the overall scope of the environment, that it takes a while before familiarity comes into play.  Once it does, the show really takes off and the viewer ends up realizing the slower beginning was completely necessary.Unlike other HBO series (like ""The Sopranos"") which seem to pull their punches and pull fast ones of their audience, ""The Wire"" is about a raw and honest a show as you can find."	5.0	A truly great crime drama	2013-06-17	2	2	0

I tried it sober; perhaps I should have tried it drunk. Ham acting, cliched backdrops (pole-dancing was an idea already on its last legs before The Sopranos ran it into the ground)and dialogue which may possibly be realistic but certainly is dull.

I DON'T KNOW HOW THE CREATORS DID IT, BUT THEY'VE CREATED PLOT AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENTS PARALLELING THE WORKS OF SHAKESPEARE AND DICKENS, YET MORE GRIPPING AND MORE EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO PRESENT DAY UNSCHOOLED PERSONS THAN THE FORMER TWO AUTHORS. EACH EPISODE STANDS UP TO ETHICAL AND MORAL ANALYSIS AND DIDACTIC DISASSEMBLY INTO THE TYPICAL SHAKESPEARIAN AND GREEK ANALYSIS WHICH WE DO FOR EACH AND EVERY EPISODE. TRAGIC CHARACTER FLAWS CONVINCINGLY UNFOLD OVER THE COURSE OF THE EPISODES ONLY TO LEAD TO A TRAGIC DEATH. MAN TO MAN VERBAL JOUSTING SCENARIOS WITH ALL THE FLAIR OF SHAKESPEARE'S BEST WORK ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE SERIES. THE MOST COLD BLOODED OF THE EVIL GUYS IS ONE WHO IS GAY AND WOULD NEVER KILL ANYBODY EXCEPT AS A RIVAL BUSINESS GANG MEMBER WHO LIKE HIMSELF KNOWS THE RULES OF THE DEADLY GAME THEY PLAY. THIS MOST COLORFUL PERSON GUIDES US THROUGH MORAL SUMMARIES WHICH PORTRAY TO ALL OF US THE BASIC RULES OF THE INSIDE GAME. THE VIOLENCE IS NEVER GRATUITOUS AND ALWAYS HAS IT'S OWN MORAL MESSAGE. WE NEVER DELIGHT IN BUT TYPICALLY MOURN THE DEATH OF THE VICTIM AS SOMEONE CAUGHT IN THE UNCONTROLED FORCES OF DEPRIVATION, BASE IGNORANCE AND STRATEGIC MISTEPS. THIS IS A GREAT ANTIDOTE TO THE AYN RAND GARBAGE OF NATURAL SELECTION AND THE UTTERLY ABSURD IDEA THAT A MAN CAN RISE ABOVE EITHER HIS ORIGINS OR THE DAY TO DAY CARDS HE IS DEALT AS HE STRUGGLES FOR SURVIVAL. BASICALLY, IT'S THE STORY OF THE REST OF US, UP FROM NOTHING AND JUST DAMM LUCKY TO GET WHAT WE GET. WHETHER ONE SURVIVES OR NOT IS NOT PREDETERMINED, BUT CAN BE ENHANCED SIGNIFICANTLY BY PERSONAL INTEGRITY, FAITH TO ONE'S RIGHT INSTINCTS, AND THE ACUTE AND THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF ONE'S SURROUNDINGS DAY BY BLOODY DAY.	5.0	REINVENTION OF THE MORALITY PLAY	2011-05-15	2	1	1

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A7Q1W04HT3EKS	"Phillip ""amazon_phil"""	Most people will tell you that their HBO lineup is The Sopranos, Sex and the City, Entourage, Six Feet Under, etc.  Typically, most only know the big hits on HBO Sunday night drama and this little series is almost never heard from most HBO subscribers.  It took me a while before I really discovered this drama since I was following most HBO big hit dramas.  But, I think this series definitely deserves credit for story-telling and character development.  I can only compare this with other dramas on HBO which require strong committment to your Sunday night life and also cable subscription.  Well, that all changed with DVDs which are pricey with HBO compared with network dramas.  I guess that's what you get when you have big budgets with really good dramas.  Recently, HBO has been having deals on their older series so this isn't a problem if you keep your eyes open to Sunday ads.  That's how I got caught into this series and it kept me on the edge of my seat.  Alot of new faces with strong talent makes this drama rolling.  I tried to follow typical crime dramas like CSI and Law & Order but I lose interest fast.  This drama actually has a detailed drawn-out plot which builds up momentum for the whole season unlike your typically weekly show that neatly wraps up the plot that night.  You then appreciate that HBO brought this show to light even though it hasn't gotten the real appreciation from others.The DVDs are packaged quite nicely like most HBO season sets are typically released.  There are not much frills on this DVD set as most TV DVD releases, but that's fine with most people who have little patience to sit through commentaries and deleted scenes.  The image and sound are crisp, and that's what matter to most people.  Simple menus make it easy for most to skip between scenes and browse through episodes with summaries and previous episode summaries.	5.0	Fresh Drama from HBO	2007-07-29	2	1	1

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2VDLWH94XAKBP	Prism	I binge watched all 5 seasons in the last two weeks, so that might say something. The first season is easily the best out of all of them. I would give it five stars. The characters are great. The story moves along. The writing is crisp and tight. The second season starts to get sloppy. It isn't about being complex or not. It just feels like so much of the story was unresolved and never really made it out of earlier draft stages. That theme carries through the rest of the show. However, the original characters and the relationships among them keep you going through the whole show. The new characters that enter the picture, and sometime replace the old ones (I won't say which) are never as interesting as the originals in the way West Wing continued to add great characters through at least four seasons. They are either devoid of personality or they seem a bit of caricature.Never expect the sweeping positivism of a show like West Wing. This is a gritty drama and it takes you into the crap of society, and not in just the drug ridden streets at that. It shows you the scum at the highest levels. This show is definitely not black hats and white hats. Good guys are flawed and do some bad things, and the bad guys have some redeeming values and do some honorable things. There is a lot of gray.  It is the interweaving of characters (mostly original), personalities and situations that does get you hooked. All i all, it's life and more real than any &#34;reality show.&#34;It can get confusing, as there are a lot of chacters to keep track of. I frequently referred to wiki episodes guides to look up look up characters. If you are googling characters, use episode guides because otherwise you see many big spoilers (this one gets killed, this one survives, these two break up, these two get together, whatever).The one thing that this show is, unfortunately, is very truthful. I have worked closely with all the types of people in this show (cops, journalists, politicians, community leaders and educators). The depiction of of how much greed, unsavory politics and personal agendas constantly overcome true achievement is all too real. And like real life, it is often the ones looking out only for themselves are the ones who win in the beginning, middle and end. But not always. Some of them lose. At the same time, as the show reveals, changing the system will not be easy, as the system is entrenched and there are so many moving pieces, one can't possibly hope to change the whole system.You will get 'hooked' just like an addict on the great 'product&#34; they are selling. You will know you saw a great show. You will be driven to find out what happens to characters. You just might not always feel great about it, just like the cops don't always don't feel great about their work. But like the cops, you will have those great moments where you can only relish loudly among friends in Irish pub or quietly in parking lot chucking empty beer cans up on a roof. Or quietly, where the whole messed up world might not see it or value it, but you know you did the right thing.Plan on losing the next few weeks once you start watching.	4.0	Addictive like the stuff being sold, but not always good	2014-06-15	0	0	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1TPW86OHXTXFC	"prisrob ""pris,"""	"This review is from: The Wire: The Complete First Season (DVD)I am such a fan of 'The Wire'. I watched every show on HBO, and then when the series came out on DVD, my first request was for 'The Wire'. Once you have seen one show, you cannot stop. You know this because you are reading this review and have found it to be so true.I have become entranced with every character- McNulty, Daniels, Greggs, Freamen, Moreland, Hauck, Sydnor, Rawls, Burrell, Norris, and Omar, Barksdale and Bubbles. All the detectives in Baltmore, their superiors, the street gang, and the people, the innocent people. David Simon the writer who gave us 'The Wire' wanted us to get to know all of them. we started to care about them. 'Damn, that Rawls for putting McNulty in such a position. Burrell, protecting all of his cronies, thinking he was doing his job...but we knew better. The streets, the drugs, the terror, the blood and guts all of this so unreal to most of us. I thought many times, there but for the grace of God is me, there but for the benefit of my birth, I was given the good life, a white middle class life. The good and the evil, the crime that these brave detectives try to wipe out, day by day, doing the best job they can and becoming proud of the job they are doing. How can we not love this series? I finished year one in two days. I have seen it before, but I picked up new highlights- oh how I love this series.In Season One, the police tried to infiltrate the West Baltimore drug ring. We saw the crime and evil, up close and personal. Yet,we find nothing is done in the real world. David Simon said ""We are a culture without the will to seriously examine our own problems. We eschew that which is complex, contradictory or confusing. As a culture, we seek simple solutions. We enjoy being provoked and titillated, but resist the rigorous, painstaking examination of issues that might, in the end, bring us to the point of recognizing our problems, which is the essential first step to solving any of them.""Really, you must view this series again. You gotta do, go now.Highly Highly Recommended. prisrob 12-21-09Homicide: A Year on the Killing StreetsThe Corner (HBO Miniseries)Comments (3) | Permalink | Most recent comment: Dec 31, 2009 9:06 PM PST"	5.0	Life on The Streets	2009-12-21	1	1	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AW0COADCO27N0	P. Wilczynski	Without a doubt, The Wire is one of the seminal pieces of television of our generation. Under the guise of a simple detective show, it dives deep into the underbelly of a dying, dysfunctional city, with a raw depiction of urban decay mixed with hope. The producers hold nothing back as they confront racism, social injustice, and the complex relationship with the law that only true poverty can illuminate. I know that this isn't the same as really, truly understanding the complexities and challenges of growing up in a different world, but I know that this show has made me a more tolerant, understanding human being. Please take some time and watch this.	5.0	Watch this	2012-12-25	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2N1GTBL6MZLKA	Quality Lover	My incentive to begin watching this series (a dozen years after it originally aired) was that a blogger, discussing &#34;Mad Men,&#34; said that &#34;The Wire&#34; was also one of the best TV series of all time.  Well, &#34;Mad Men&#34; and &#34;The Wire&#34; are quite different--so different that I can't figure how someone would enjoy/rate them as (superior) equals.  Maybe &#34;The Wire&#34; was unique TV fare for it's time, but as a first time viewer in 2014, I did not find it all that compelling.  After about Episode 5, (Season 1) my interest began to wane.  True, it has gritty realism, and the acting is superior.  But there is not a single character that I am riveted by --with the possible exception of the Lieutenant.  (But he's not in enough scenes in my opinion).  Also, I found it a little hard to follow with just a single viewing of each episode.  But kudos to the series for depicting what is probably a very good (&#34;true to life&#34;) look at the world of inner city drugs/police politics/and human drama surrounding the characters who inhabit that milieu.	2.0	Doesn't hold up over time?

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A28OS9JADNW18M	"Rashid Darden ""Novelist"""	I watched The Wire when it originally aired and have watched episodes from the first season several times.  Now, thanks to Amazon Instant Video, I have been able to binge-watch the entire first season again.  Needless to say, I am a big fan of The Wire and really wanted to give it five stars.  But to be honest, there were a few areas for improvement in the first season that subsequently did get better in future seasons.  The major complaint is the pacing and the payoff.  Yes, The Wire is a slow-moving storm and that is one of its strengths, yet there were times in the first season where the pace really was too slow.  As Detective Freeman said, all the pieces matter, but at the same time, it's tough to know what we're looking at when there is so much to decipher.  As far as the payoff goes, it's slightly annoying that the big payoff for this season really does not occur within the season.  That doesn't mean that this wasn't a first-rate, high quality show - it just means that you have to commit to the entire thing.  I can't judge season one by what happens in season five... so I can only give season one four stars.	4.0	All the pieces matter, but there are so many pieces.	2014-07-10	0	0	0

My favorite is Sopranos, so The Wire has to compare. I've only seen four episodes so far. It's got my attention, but it lacks the human interest of the Sopranos. Also, The Wire is too focused on one idea, one theme: get Barksdale. The Sopranos had many characters and situations that made each show a new experience.	4.0	Definitely not for the fainthearted.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A187R4WAIDDHAY	Redd Dogg	"I've never written a review on Amazon before, but this series has affected me like no other. I did not become a fan until the second season. I had seen an episode or two and found it confusing and obtuse. I realized that it's impossible to watch casually. For any hope of understanding what is going on, you have to watch a whole season (the whole series for that matter) from beginning to end (some episodes twice). This is what has captivated me. There are no contrived, cockamamie introductions of characters or storylines. As a viewer, you are dropped in the first episode of the first season with no explanation of who the characters are or what they are doing. They already know and it's the viewer's job to figure out what is going on.The storylines are complex and abundant and all of them are interesting. A storyline may be initiated in one episode and not touched on again for three more episodes or the effects of a storyline may not come to fruition for several episodes. There simply is no better show on TV, including ""The Sopranos"". It's worth watching for those with an attention span and a willingness to think about what they are watching, so it's probably not for most people."	5.0	The best TV show ever	2004-12-26	15	14	1

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AOWL4HHC2B2SR	"Richard A. Cusick ""Illegal Lawyer"""	The Wire is unique in that it simultaneously creates empathy from the audience for both the cops and the criminals portrayed. Season one focuses on 2001-ish technology and how criminals outsmart it as well as fall prey to it. It is centered around the street trade of heroin on the rough streets of Baltimore (bal-more as they pronounce it in the show). The show is authentic, realistic, and quite gritty. The characters are all flawed individuals, but utterly human. The show un-apologetically portrays racism, so the thin-skinned should be careful. it is not appropriate for children or adults offended by anything racier than PG-13.	5.0	Best cops and criminals show ever	2014-06-29	0	0	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A9K6X5VZKCVUI	Richard A Nicolai	The actors do a great job.  It is an intense show that goes into great depth to show the potential problems that police have in working in poorer neighborhoods where many of the residents are involved in drugs or other illegal activities.  It is definitely not a show that would be appropriate for children under the age of 16. The basic premise of the show is the effort a few police officers put forth to bring down a top drug lord in a major city.  The drug lord controls whole neighborhoods, but is smart enough to make certain he is not directly involved in most of the illegal activities.  The show also has scenes where you get to see how the pressures of police work impact the families of the officers involved.  The show probably overplays the impact that politics have on everyday police work.  The show is not for everyone, but it is extremely well done and gets into details of police work that a lot of other crime shows don't. It also probably does a better job showing that good police work takes time and patience and that sometimes things don't work out the way you hope they would.	5.0	Adult type program--need to watch all episodes in sequence to keep track of what is happening	2014-05-31	1	1	0

Once you realize it's a bit more in tune with actual police work and not everyone can simply get a warrant at the drop of a hat, it's kind of refreshing to see for a crime drama. Also seeing it a decade after it came out, it doesn't seem to age nearly as well as say the Sopranos or anything. But I guess that's the point.

It is uncomfortable to watch, and does not rise to the level of good solid entertainment in my view.

I also went on to become a lawyer.With that as background for my opinion, ""The Wire"" is the best and most realistic drama I have ever seen.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3SHQXNOPZBJH	Robert Byrd	After literally years of hearing about this HBO series and how great it is, I decided to purchase a used boxed set of Season One,  It arrived and was quickly placed in a bookcase where I keep other DVD's I plan on watching. It probably sat there for a year.  Then on a whim one cold winter evening, I decided to pop it in the DVD player.  I thought the first episode was good, but not earth shattering as many of the reviews on this site suggest.  But, I nonetheless stuck with it.  By the sixth or seventh episode, I was completely hooked.  What magnificent storytelling with fully realized, complex characters!  No one is perfect in this series, and everyone is flawed a a major way.  And what I like most is the writers' willingness to make drug dealers  - who, let's face it, are not viewed with much sympathy by damn near anyone - look, talk and act like real human beings (who can be just as fascinating as the people we more traditionally choose to admire).  THE WIRE is television at its finest - it simply doesn't get any better.  But here's a kicker for you - this series never won a single major television award.  NOT ONE!!! When I think about it, it's probably a good thing - a real testament to its uncompromising superiority to much of the other mindless garbage on television.  I look forward to watching the other four seasons.	5.0	COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY HOOKED!!!	2010-02-09	4	4	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AUM3YMZ0YRJE0	Robert J. Crawford	"I came to this series with very very high expectations:  it is supposed to be realistic with ambiguous outcomes and the realization of a wider tableau than normally expected in pat cop melodramas.  I was astonished to find that it surpassed my expectations by an order of magnitude, to the point that I unequivocally believe that this is the best coherent drama that I have ever seen on TV.  This isn't about taut drama that is self-contained in a single episode and full of deus ex machina resolutions, but a long multifaceted narrative with complex characters and deep themes on urban America at a time of industrial decline.  The acting - all by relative unknowns who are perfectly cast - could not be better:  the subtlety and slow evolution of the characters is unprecedented in my view, as is the realism.  You get difficult careers, vital political issues, and damaged personal lives, all while fulfilling the calling of being ""a police"".  I have never seen anything like it.In this first season, a team slowly coalesces into a wonderful combination of talent, fanatical focus, and mission.  McNulty is the emotional focus of the team:  he is a screwup with an alcohol problem, but a great cop.  His family life is a disaster, his career in ruins because of his failures to play the politics.  Gifted with raw charm and a maniacal focus on getting the bad guys, he finds a way to become a member in an extraordinary team.  Though he has many internal enemies, there are many people of great talent he can latch onto.  He is a realistic participant in the Baltimore ecosystem of struggling workers in a deindutrialized economy, sociopathic drug dealers, corrupted politicians, and caring citizens, including cops.  One of his greatest enemies is the need to maintain statistics in the drug war, going for short-term showiness that hinders deeper investigations into crime lords who are entering legitimate businesses.The underworld is a parallel universe with its own rituals and ethic.  The characters in it are also great, with vividly believable nicknames, like string and little man, and they are realistic personalities.  There are outcasts in it who are parasites in conflict with the organized crime figures who are corrupting politics in the city (e.g. Omar v. Stringer), pathetic junkies who try to survive (e.g. Bubbles), and young ghetto rats trying to make it and willing to murder their adversaries to do so.What is the most interesting, for me, was the portrayal of the extraordinary intricacy, each with its uncertainties and consequences, of the way that a prosecutorial case must be put together.  While somewhat successful, it leaves much to be done, in the next seasons.  There are baddies pursued, and their organization in all its intricate parts become potential targets in a legal proceedings, with wonderful lawyers developing them with egotistical judges.Each episode is dense, but dependent on the others and ever more densely complex.  You can watch them multiple times, with deeper perception of them at each viewing.  It is best not to watch too many in one sitting, but at most 2 per evening.This is some of the best TV I have ever experienced.  Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm."	5.0	The best cop series I have ever seen	2009-12-05	5	5	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AU3PO882GSVB	Robert Lange	It holds your interest without all the cheap clich&eacute;'s and phony camera work. Well written, well acted, well done. A behind the scenes view of the Baltimore police inner workings as a new form of technology meets an old corrupt leadership with predictable consequences. With a bit of a dirty dozen flare, a group of forgotten misfits take on the most difficult aspect of the war on drugs, the street as well as their superiors who could care less about the rampant corruption in the department and further up the ladder than media credit for small time busts and front page flash.	5.0	Engaging	2014-05-28	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A6ZHELYBSVO65	Robert Young	"I can't add much to the description of the content and the quality of the acting/writing/production that hasn't already been said more eloquently than I could ever hope to, but I will say that if you watch one episonde of this show, you *will* want to see them all. It's that good.I was a fan of the show ""Line of Fire"" on ABC, but it was eventually cancelled (strangely, their web page is still around at [...] Reviewers had panned the show, saying that it was a weak imitation of ""The Wire"" on HBO (I don't subscibe). So, when I was in a local video store and found nothing that interested me that day, I noticed a copy of the first DVD from The Wire box set for rent and picked it up - the store had split the box set and was renting each DVD separately.All the characteristics that other people here have pointed to are evident from the very first episode, and it only gets better. By the time my wife and I had rented the second DVD in the set, we knew we were going to purchase the complete set because it was *that good* and something we were going to watch more than once.We later bought Season two (also wonderful). Now I'm eagerly awaiting the release of Season Three, and was glad to hear they are working on production for Season Four.- Robert"	5.0	It will hook you	2005-12-10	6	6	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1ZH52JAC70RIR	Robin Benson	All the other reviewers have expressed my views on this extraordinary series, on any level it is hard to fault, story, acting, direction, casting, locations, music and even background sounds are just right but I think it's worth getting a copy of 'The Wire' (ISBN 0743497325) book.  Having watched both series more than once I really wanted to know more.The first two series have a complete plot synopsis, a listing of the cast and crew, black and white and color photos, several key characters/actors get their own pages and there is plenty to read about how the series was created and why.  Some quirky stuff includes a chapter called 'The Legend of the Yellow Sofa' and 'The Insider's Guide to the Cast'.  The city of Baltimore gets a chapter: 'Mayor to The Wire: Drop Dead'You can get the book really cheaply from several Amazon Marketplace sellers.	5.0	Make it even more enjoyable	2006-04-30	5	5	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AZBYE18T093OQ	Robin Claassen	"""The Wire"" has done something that has never been done before on television. It has taken a look at a conflict between different groups of people, and done so in a manner that brings about understanding, and feelings of compassion for all the characters involved. Rather than moralizing, and encouraging the viewers to root for one side over the other, ""The Wire"" encourages the viewer to take the wider view, and be disturbed by the tragedy of all the characters being involved in the conflict in the first place.While the show very much causes one to feel compassion, and even love for its individual characters, the focus of the show is more upon the larger societal dynamics that create the situation all the characters find themselves within.  The show explores the pathos of a corrupt political system, an utterly broken and dysfunctional police department, a drug organization that ultimately destroys its members' lives and everything they hold precious, and so many lost potentials and lives wasted to drugs. You get the feeling that all the characters are trapped in their life roles in ""The Wire"", and you're able to gain at least some vague understanding of what the forces are in our society that create those roles.From the subject matter of the show, you might think that ""The Wire"" would be pessimistic and depressing to watch, but I feel that it is really uplifting and offers hope to us as a society. If the viewer can feel forgiveness and compassion for D'Angelo Barksdale, a man who has helped to cause a lot of suffering, then maybe they can begin to feel some degree of forgiveness and compassion for themselves, and those around them. ""The Wire"" makes the world a less scary place. It helps us to understand a lot of disturbing stuff in our society, and maybe even helps us to begin to understand what a solution to our problems might look like. ""The Wire"" looks at all of its characters as if through the eyes of a lover, and sees how they are beautiful; in doing so, shows us how we are beautiful. The show helps us to value ourselves, those around us, and the world we live in. It is truly a profound honoring of life.(...)"	5.0	An Honoring of Life	2004-10-26	43	36	7

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A38LT5DE8K7WDQ	Roman Milan	The first installment of David Simon's transcendent TV series The Wire already demonstrates why the show is so beloved, even 10 years after its original run. The first season leaves the viewer somehow both shell-shocked and utterly dissatisfied, making it nearly impossible to do anything but pick up the second season and pop it into the DVD player. The show's ability to evoke powerful emotions and deep questions that the first season is unlike anything else we've ever seen on TV. The fact that many diehard fans of the show find this season to be the worst of the series' five seasons is amazing when looking at this season in isolation, and speaks volumes as to the quality of the series as a whole.The Wire depicts the conflicts between the Baltimore Police Department and the city's criminal organizations, primarily the drug dealing Barksdale crew (at least in the first season). Where the show really shines is when it shows us the tensions within these organizations. The Baltimore PD always seem to be battling between cops who actually want to do real police work and those who want to just ride the system until their next paycheck or promotion. On the other side of the yellow tape there seems to be the opposite problem, where anybody who doesn't play the drug dealing game with all they've got is likely to end up dead. And when good-natured guys like D'Angelo Barksdale (Larry Gilliard Jr.) or Wallace (Michael B. Jordan) try to buck the game for their own morals, the game always bucks back.The first season received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback from critics when it originally aired, some calling it even better than some of HBO's most beloved series such as Six Feet Under and The Sopranos. Despite all of these accolades the show did not gain a large following of viewers, a problem that would persist in some form until the show's fifth and final season. In fact, many fans of the show did not watch the original one, and have since found their love for the show through watching the episodes on DVD or online (much in the same way Arrested Development has).There is so much to like about this season. The technical proficiency and artistry of the directorial decisions would put this season on par with many Oscar nominees. The acting is absolutely superb, which is necessary for the amount of investment the show runners have us as the audience put in to each character. However, one of the most fantastic things about this season is its ability to subvert conventions with a defiance that wouldn't be out of place in a 1980s punk rocker. For example, the show's coolest, most badass character is Omar. Omar robs drug dealers for a living, carries a giant shotgun, and commands fear from everybody around him. To compensate for this the show's writers make him gay in the traditionally homophobic black ghetto community. Other characters often make jokes about his sexuality, but they always give him respect. And this is only one example. They also set up such subversions as making no character immortal no matter how beloved or popular they are, and refusing to put a flat character into the show, instead giving every single one motives and feelings associated with their actions.The only critique I have for this season isn't so much something that I wish they had taken the time to improve, as much as it is pointing out a necessary evil that comes with the nature of the show. The reason many fans find this to be the worst season is because they spend so long setting up the characters and their situations from which we can begin the story. While this does take a long time, the show develops slowly from the way that it's written and paced. It's simply part of the show's style. And any less exposition would leave the plot turns and character developments later wanting in emotional catharsis.I would recommend this series to those well versed in film or TV shows, simply because it takes everything you thought you could expect and turns it on its head. I would also caution you before you begin to make sure that you have the time to put in to this series, as each episode is a full hour long (because HBO doesn't have commercials). If you enjoyed this season, there really isn't anything to do but keep watching the series. When you finish with this one, some other comparable series are Breaking Bad and Mad Men. 5/5	5.0	The Beginning of a Beautiful Viewership	2013-01-28	0	0	0

Makes me wonder why I have not see more of them on TV and movies.Sure, Game of Thrones is lush and complicated, Homeland keeps us guessing and Breaking Bad has Bryan Cranston, but none of these have the depth and breadth of The Wire.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3HIUT2S4OLAZA	Saam	"Critics have called it the best series on TV. The reviewers praised the relatively unknown cast, narrative structure and action-filled plots of this police drama.For me, however, this was much more that a police story. It was about challenges to change societies and systems.Why police cannot deal with crime properly? Why it is hard to improve education system? Why politicians don't deliver on all of their promises? Why media is weak to provide independent and unbiased reports that matter? Why there is still extreme poverty in the world? It is easy to blame the teachers, politicians, special interest or ""bad guys"". In reality the answer is much more complicated. The Wire digs deep into difficulties to reform systems in a beautiful way that is both entertaining and educational.Be it the war on crime, war on poverty or war against terrorism, The Wire illustrates why it is hard to make a lasting change.Each season introduces new elements, starting from local gangs, drug dealers to judges, politicians, taxes and budgets, international criminals, labor unions, schools and media. Every actor has to work harmoniously to keep the system sustainable.It is by far the best thing put on TV."	5.0	Realistic illustration of challenges to make lasting change	2011-02-12	18	16	2
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3P6NUYXV19T0D	S. A. BLEIWEIS	[The Wire] is one of the best shows currently on TV; it is at least as good, if not better, than HBO's other two lauded dramas, [Six Feet Under] and [The Sopranos]. I usually don't like cop dramas, and I've never watched [NYPD Blue] or [Homicide: Life on the Street] (the latter of which was based on a book written by [Wire] creator David Simon). But from the first episode of [The Wire], I was hooked. It features such an amazing group of interesting, well-drawn-out characters, it's virtually impossible not to care about them. And it does well to present the main issue--the drug culture in Baltimore--from the point of view of both the investigating cops and the drug dealers (and in season two drug traffickers were added). [The Wire] has great acting and is extraordinarily well written. Just try watching one episode, and not be dying to know what happens next!Now granted, this is not a show that is easily accessible to the casual viewer. There are so many characters and storylines that you basically need to watch every episode to keep up. So what better medium to watch the show than DVD!! It's about time HBO is releasing season one, and I very much look forward to season three later this year.[The Wire] is not the most uplifting show you'll see this year, but it will likely be the best.	5.0	This is the most engrossing show on television	2004-07-27	25	22	3

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A143P0NKQDNWYL	"Sal Paradise ""ethanallen95"""	The reason why I still watch HBO, the Wire (and Real Sex) but the Wire is basically a gritty urban drama in the same vein as Homocide, however you get multiple points of view, one from the cops, the politicians and the drug dealer. In this case the main villian is Avon Barksdale, who is the top kingpin in a family run drug empire. You have a squad of police officers and detectives out to bring down his street empire through use of the wire (tapping public phones and business offices that Barksdale and his associates use). Yet Barksdale isn't some young thoughtless moron. He has the IQ boarding genius level, and he's got public officials and people in high places in his pocket. Taking him down or even putting a dent in the drug traffic on the Baltimore streets will take more than just a few simple arrests. What I like about this series is that there really isn't a line between good and evil. Meaning that there is actually a very deep human drama, real acting going on here. I haven't seen much of the second season but if it's anything like the first season I can't wait to check it out.	5.0	One Of the Best Cop/Crook Dramas On TV	2005-06-28	3	3	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AO6U3C5QH8CON	"Samuel Louis ""raisindot"""	"I watched all of the The Wire when it originally aired, and now I'm rewatching the entire series again. In all of the passing years, I don't think any other series has surpassed it in terms of amazing writing, acting, and a take-no-prisoners narrative style that neither dumbs down nor sentimantalizes a single thing.Is the first season of The Wire the best? One could argue that it is, because it was so new and groundbreaking at the time that David Simon and Co. didn't have the ""How are we going to outdo this"" onus that marred Season 2 and occasionally caused narrative lapses in seasons 3, 4 and 5. It's also the strongest season because the narrative focused solely on developing the stories of the ""poh-lice"" and the criminals. It didn't let ""bigger"" issues like corruption on the docks, mayoral elections or the plight of city newspapers dilute this central premise. For the most part, The Wire was able to successfully integrate these themes into the main narrative without ever jumping the shark, even in its weakest episodes.Some people claim that the pace of the first season is slow, particularly those who were hooked by the images of the computers and phone lines displayed in the opening sequences. But this pace reflected the true difficulty of getting things done in a post 9/11 law enforcement environment, when all attention and funds were diverted to monitoring library card use rather than combating good old fashioned drug dealers and gang violence. These cops aren't heroes; they're flawed, lazy, alcoholic, career- focused, bigoted, abusive and, except for lone wolves like McNulty, Kima and Freeman, generally fearful of rocking the boat. In short, they're human. Just like many of the crew in the Low-Risers are. A teenage dealer wakes up a bunch of homeless kids living in a decrepit apartment and sends them off to school. D'Angelo Barksdale, boss of the drug pit, shows genuine remorse when confronted with the death of an a witness who had testified against him even though he wasn't responsible for the man's death. In the face of unsparing poverty and hopelessness, they occasionally try to do good.If there is one episode of Season 1 that stands out, it's the fourth episode, written by Simon. It features the hilariously vulgar defense of McNulty by his self-effacing sargeant, and Lester Freeman's backstory. But the true stand-out scene occurs when McNulty and his partner Bunk are meticulously re-examining a long-dormant murder scene. As they place crime scene photos and wield tape measures and explore every surface in a kitchen where the shooting had taken place, the only word either man speaks for nearly five minutes is the f-word and variations therefor. But it's not spoken merely as an expletive, but as an adjective, an adverb, a question, an answer, and a hypothetical. Such a scene shouldn't work at all; its sheer audacity calls attention to its artifice, but somehow it works because the two cops have worked so closely together they can use a single word to communicate everything with each other. For this scene alone, the entire first season is worth purchasing."	5.0	Perhaps the best of perhaps the best series ever.	2013-01-03	1	1	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AR1T36GLLAFFX	Scott FS	There are (at last count) 237 reviews for the first season of 'The Wire'.  I've read a number of places that this is an excellent series, so I thought I'd give it a try.This has a large cast, and it takes a while to put every one of them in their place.  You've got your politicians, your police, your detectives, your FBI, your reporters, your drug runners, your murderers, your spouses, your lovers, and your drug kingpins.  Wow!  And those are just the main characters.The conceit of the series is that the police must get judges (oops, forgot them in the cast...) to approve wiretaps.  In the first season, that means the pay phones that the drug runners and drug middlemen use to run their drug trade, primarily in the projects.The cast is outstanding.  The setting is good, the photography great.I liked the first series, even though the ending is sort of a let down because there are many loose ends.  However, that just sets up the second season.Highly recommended.  It paints a picture of the intractability of shutting down drug traffic, because if you put one cadre out of business, another quickly takes its place.  After all, nature abhors a marketplace vacuum.I liked this a lot.  Season two promises to be just as good.Update:  I've seen the entire series, and all I can say is, wow!  This is television of the highest caliber.  It's violent, to be sure, and sometime hard to watch because of it, but I guess that world is really that violent.Please watch this!  It is so rich and complex, it begs for multiple viewing, which means it's a good bet to buy rather than rent.	5.0	Richly textured crime drama	2010-05-31	9	9	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A19HCQSC5FVOXW	Scott McFarland	"""The Sopranos"" was an awesome show, unlike any before it.  This one's probably even more awesome, a step further into greatness and realism.  Because so many of the characters are African-American, it may not be embraced by America as ""The Sopranos"" has been, but it should be.This show is full of grit and realism, as was its excellent predecessor ""The Corner"" (done by some of the same producers and with some of the same cast).  Here the bleakness that we saw in ""The Corner"" is made more palatable, and more interesting, by contrasting ""the game"" with the machinations of the police on the other side of the line.  As with ""The Sopranos"", very bleak stories can be told, and made extremely entertaining, through great character development and through brilliant use of dark humor.Definitely the most underrated show on television, and one of the great series currently running.  Full of great performances, great writing, great (if cynical) humor, and the best look into the reality of the streets that you can get while sitting safely in your living room.  An amazing accomplishment in television, absolutely."	5.0	Must-See TV	2004-09-27	6	5	1
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"""The Wire"" is further evidence that HBO has produced some of the best television ever shown in the States.  Whether ""The Wire"" is better or worse than other hallowed series such as ""The Sopranos,"" ""Band of Brothers,"" or ""Rome"" is immaterial - this series is, without hyperbole, magnificent.  Creator David West and co-writer Ed Burns, along with the rest of the bunch, deserve all the praise heaped upon them.Essentially, ""The Wire"" is a cop show set in Baltimore.  The drug trade is ruining this troubled city - not for nothing does Episode One open with a cop cynically discussing the fate of a dead kid with a local, and then follow it up with a murderer being acquitted because a witness has been bought off.  The lone witness who testifies is murdered almost immediately thereafter. A frustrated cop, McNulty (Dominic West) discloses to the judge that a local drug ring led by Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris) is operating with impunity, including buying off and murdering witnesses.  The judge authorizes the titular ""wire"" - wire-taps on project payphones - to nail Barksdale.The judge also raises a beef with the police force, a close-knit, regimented fraternity where rogues like McNulty are despised.  So, to keep the judge happy, the cops assemble a rag-tag squad of cast-offs and rejects, stick them with the basement, and assume the investigation goes nowhere.  But thanks to some stellar detective work, the wire starts to produce results.So far, so good. That's all to be expected in a police procedural.  But what elevates ""The Wire"" is that we don't just see the good cops tracking down the bad drug dealers.  We see the dealers and those who live with them in all their humanity.  There are good guys who deal drugs in Baltimore because that's all they have done for generations.  Adding further spice to ""The Wire"" is the rampant corruption of Baltimore police and politicians.""The Wire"" keeps the viewer jumping from plot-line to plot-line, which include such varied threads as a dealer struggling with his conscience, a cop fighting for visitation rights to his kids, a trigger-happy cop learning while on suspension that he's got a gift for data-crunching, a dealer forced to work with the cops to avenge his murdered lover, and a druggie struggling to clean himself up.  None of these plot lines is forced to walk a straight line, but all are allowed to bob and weave through the characters' lives.  Through it all, ""The Wire"" remains true to itself, and no notes ring false.Here's looking forward to Season Two.  If you have a significant other who will get frustrated with your dedication to this series, just watch the first episode of the first season, and you will both be hooked.  And grateful."	5.0	A testament to how good television can be	2007-03-13	2	2	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A30X7VQZILMFZT	Sertorius	Until recently I had believed that the Shield was the best police procedural currently in production and the Homicide:  Life on the Street represented the pinnacle of the genre.  After watching the first season of HBO's the wire I now understand that I was mistaken.  This is not to say that the Wire is necessarily a superior drama to the Shield and Homicide, but it is definitely better at the realistic portrayal of both criminals and police.  In particular the Wire's portrayal of systematic corruption; as largely entrenched, petty and venial; is unique and resonates with anyone who has had to operate within a bureaucracy.The wire is also unique in its story-telling method.  The season revolves around a single police investigation, with point of view perspectives (and major protagonists) on either side of the law.  Everyone is flawed and conflicted.  Even the best cops are either self-destructive alcoholics (McNulty) or on the take; and the criminals range from the chillingly ruthless Stringer Bell; to the conflicted D'Angelo; and the poetic professionalism of Omar.  This is a true ensemble cast, given great writing and a seamless, season long arc to work with.  As other reviewers have commented, this a novel that was written for television as you must watch it from beginning to end to get the full impact.  There is a feeling of great immediacy and authenticity throughout the production.  I give the Wire Season 1 my highest recommendation, particularly to anyone who is a fan of Homicide, the Sopranos, the Shield, Boomtown or any other dark, character driven drama with great writing and season long story arcs.	5.0	Dark, gritty and cynical police procedural...	2005-07-01	6	6	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AJJ11F5MHN8K9	"sfarmer76 ""sfarmer76"""	HBO produces The Wire, $79.99 US, which is an original drama that I've only recently discovered. The Wire is the creative vision of David Simon and Ed Burns, and skilled writers like George Pellecanos have even been caught contributing to episodes. The thing I like most about The Wire is this, it doesn't condescend to the audience. The plot is fairly intricate for a one hour drama, and there are many different characters to follow, actors to keep track of. Also, the show is fairly realistic in its portrayal of a months long investigation, wherein criminals engage in deadly but lucrative turf wars, and hard working cops face mean-spirited reprisals for simply doing their jobs. People that live in Baltimore will especially enjoy this show, since it's the setting for the drama and exteriors are shot here. There are also some good inside jokes that people from Baltimore will understand, such as when a detective holds up a Laura Lippman paperback.I was able to check out The Wire: The Complete First Season on DVD from my local library, otherwise I might never have reviewed it. Surprisingly, many DVDs (Desperate Housewives, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Sex in the City, The Forty Year Old Virgin) can be found at the library, especially boxed sets, so I'd suggest you check out the online card catalog (and interlibrary loan & hold) at your local branch before you blow your meager paycheck at the nearest Blockbuster. If you like audiobooks, you can find many of these at the library also. Some of the actors that headline The Wire are: Dominic West, John Doman, Idris Elba, Frankie R. Faison, Larry Gilliard, Jr., Wood Harris, Deidre Lovejoy, Wendell Pierce, Lance Reddick, Andre Royo, and Sonja Sohn.Each episode of The Wire has (as an added feature) audio commentary from the writers, and it was fun to go back and listen to the commentary after watching each episode. If you don't speak english, you can listen to each episode in French or Spanish. Deaf viewers can follow along with English, French, or Spanish subtitles. The run time is 775 minutes, so I'd suggest setting aside a rainy three day weekend for maximum viewing pleasure. If you lose track while switching between disks, you can review an optional Previously On... or Next On... trailer for each episode of The Wire. The video is clean and vibrant, displayed in a 4:3 aspect ratio. The DVDs featured no biographical information about the actors featured in The Wire, so disappointingly I cannot tie names to all faces. I think all the acting was superb.Although I love the theme music by Blind Boys of Alabama, I didn't enjoy having to sit through (or click through) the show intro 13 times. When you have the whole season in a box, I think one intro is enough. I'd rather have had a short audio bumper inserted in front of episodes 2-13, and the front end credits replaced with title cards on the back end. 41 whole minutes could have been carved out of the run time if the intro were removed from 12 episodes, and this might have allowed HBO to squeeze the season onto four discs instead of five, eliminating the overdone packaging in the process. I think the actors deserve more credit than I can accord them here, because if there were any paper booklets or inserts that were supposed to accompany the box set -- well -- the library must've removed them from the slipcase. Below find a single summary for the best episode of this boxed set. Enjoy viewing!DISC 5Episode 12: Cleaning UpAfter Barksdale's supply gets confiscated in the bust, Stringer hands down new rules to the crews. Barksdale and Stringer meet with Levy to discuss their next steps, which includes the elimination of any and all persons that can connect Barksdale to the drugs. Wallace returns to the pit and asks to get put back on the crew. However, Stringer has other plans for Wallace, and asks Bodie to step up for the job. The actor that plays Wallace is absolutely phenomenal.This episode (teleplay by Pellecanos) is perhaps the strongest episode in the first season of The Wire.	4.0	McNulty Says This Case Needs A Wire...	2006-01-12	6	4	2

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2IU8UGZX3OSS0	Sheila Burke	This is probably the greatest television series of all time.I would never have given the show a try had I not been recovering from surgery (I was nearly bed-ridden and there was nothing else to watch). The name implies that this is a show about drugs and police. But it's so much more. The Wire is about the decline of the large city in America. One season focuses on the War on Drugs, another on our appalling public education system. The news media, the disappearance of jobs and our politicians are the focus of other seasons.The show was far ahead of its time.	5.0	A masterpiece of storytelling	2014-07-02	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2QA5GQ00WGPP7	Some Guy	Homicide is still the finest cop series of the last 15yrs, but The Wire has to be up there. It's a change from other HBO series like the Soprano's and Six Feet Under in that the story is the thing - The Wire is meticulously plot driven, rather than the obvious familial focus of Sops and SFU.  Therein lies the shows appeal and its curse - the viewer needs to give 100% attention to actually follow the game and its players.  That is not to say the characters are inconsequential, there are brilliantly flawed people on both sides who are crucial to the story - but not more important than the story.  The Shield may be good entertainment and can tell a gritty story - but The Wire values persistance and smarts over pistol whipping and muscle. It is one of the few series to tell both sides of the crime story fairly evenly - hell Deangelo Barksdale is almost a sympathetic character, and poor Wallace - well you'll have to watch to understand - it's all in the Game.	5.0	It's all in the Game.	2005-07-26	7	7	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3H4EV4UMST3HV	steve b	As a British lover of American cop shows, everything from Hill Street Blues and Cagney and Lacey to Boomtown and the Shield, I bought The Wire on the strenght of its reviews, it not yet appearing on British TV. I was not disapointed it would be the best cop show ever, except it is far more than your everyday tale of police tracking down the bad guys. The Shield showed us complex characters like Vic Mackie, but in The Wire every character, even the minor ones, have more than one side. The drug dealers are shown to have a human side with one of them looking after a group of little kids and making sure they go to school with their lunch. Another drug dealer feels uneasy when a witness against him is murdered and another struggles to shoot a mate when ordered to do so by the boss. The cops are also shown as real people. The main character, if this show can be said to have a main character, is a boozing adulterer who uses his children to trail the bad guy. Another is also a boozing adulterer but a good cop.The Wire is in the 2000s what Hill Street Blues was for the 1980s. A quantum leap in TV drama.The acting is outstanding with the prize going to Clarke Peters as Detective Lester Freamon, a good detective who rediscovers himself after 13 years in a dead end job. Also watch out for Sonja Sohn as Kima Greggs a lesbian cop who is as tough as the men and far brigher.Cannot wait for Series 2.A word of warning for any British readers, make sure both your DVD player and TV can receive the American system before buying any DVD from America.	5.0	A Quantum Leap in TV Drama	2004-12-23	12	11	1

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A149OQJD0ASI07	stevey wundar	"If you're into television drama that paints an image of real world issues with realistic images of different kinds of people with complexity, you'll love The Wire.Season 1, which I didn't watch when originally broadcast back in 2002, is absolutely brilliant.  The best way 2 describe this show's brilliance is by acknowledging 2 things: 1) the characters are multi-dimensional kind've like the movie ""Crash"" -- nobody's all good & nobody's all bad.  So whether it's a drug dealer, a cop, a hopper, a lieutenant, a dope fiend or a regular tax-paying citizen, The Wire does a great job endowing characters with enough redeeming qualities that it isn't easy 2 dismiss everyone as all good or all bad.  2)The Wire attempts to show how complex moral issues are.  They'll show u a drug dealer but also show you conditions that said drug dealer comes from which contribute 2 some of the decisions these individuals make.  The point being that everything isn't as black and white as the religious right would have you believe.It's easy to dismiss this show as the latest ""Cop show"" but The Wire is soooo much more!I don't think any TV show short of some of the work of the genius of Norman Lear's 1970s line (All In the Family, Good Times, The Jeffersons, Maude, etc.) has so cleverly if not realistic portrayed characters on TV as real people and how real people deal with real life issues!This show is worthy of all the praise it receives (which isn't enough).Highly recommended purchase."	5.0	Wow, I can see why there's a cult following	2009-02-02	2	2	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	ARL6M5EDMOINY	"St. Imnot ""Romans 8:28 and we know that all t..."	This is the best show to ever air imo... equaled only by The Shield. The storyline is so true and accurate to the real world that I often had to remind myself that it is in my past and not present as it raised terrible memories of my own from when I was in that world myself. This show gives you a view from all sides of the workings of a big city like Baltimore and you'll understand just how bad it is and how it got to be that way. This show gives a all access pass to the view of everyone and also how everyone is tied together... from the strung out addict living on the street, to the low level pushers, the top of the deck, the blue collared workers who although they have nothing to do with it hands on are still a major part of it all, to the preachers, politicians, and everyone in between. Each season gives a different view of the same city and how it all ties together. You'll likely be super upset when it ends as many of us were.... and what is worst is unless you have seen The Shield nothing will ever come close. I love the Supranos, Sons of Anarchy, Deadwood, Vikings, Oz, Boardwalk Empire, The Borgias, and although each is great in their own ways none of them come close to this one..., except The Shield.I cannot give enough praise to the actors. One of which it turns out was so good because she was not just an actor but also a real life participant! &#34;that's how we do it in &#34;B&#34; town&#34; (a hint of whom I speak of to those who've seen it).I could go on and on about why you should see it and ramble about what makes it so right but none of my words will ever do it proper justice until you sit and watch it yourself. Like real life it isn't always action or drama or anything else.. but a mixture of all of it.. some days more of one trait than another... and that is how this show is. Give it time to set up and you'll be thankful you have the ability to watch the next episode as soon as you wish and not have to wait a whole week for the next episode to air like we did when it first was broadcast lol. You'll understand the torture we endured having to wait lol. Don't waste time on anything else... you have found the Holy Grail of shows.	5.0	The Wire... all seasons.	2014-05-21	1	1	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3KOYBUJ1PWZYS	Thales	After seeing The Wire on yet another 'Best TV Shows of the Decade' list I decided to grit my teeth and endure what I thought would be like consuming All Bran - one of those virtious good things that you feel like you have to do while wistfully looking over at the Coco Pops, which might shorten your life but is a hell of a lot more fun to have.The Wire however isn't one of those ponderous, overly earnest dramas, but an accessable show that takes you into the lives of the various characters that make up this richly structured fictional world, and it's certainly never as pretentious as this sentence is. It does one of the very few things that 'realistic and gritty' tv shows often never do by not forgetting to bring the humour along for the ride.The plot is relatively complex but it's never hard to follow due to the acting talents of the cast, stellar writing, and the fact that you can't help but become invested in the show. The writers make you feel like you're in safe hands and that they know where they're going, and whomever did the casting deserves a thumbs up and a pat on the head, the recessions answer to a payrise.By the time I got half-way through the first season I ended up rushing out to buy the rest of the set and said goodbye to friends and family.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1JMM1O4GYDM9K	The Good Doctor	This was my second time through The Wire (Season 1), and it was even better than my first time through during its original airings on HBO. What makes this a remarkable show is that it feels so authentic and manages to encapsulate the best elements of an excellent police procedural, an in-depth character study, the best gangster films, and all of those &#34;misfits become a great team&#34; films. It's also not afraid to slow burn through all of the elements and allow them to cook up to perfection.I am no fan of hyperbole in reviews, but this is honestly one of the best (if not the best) shows I've ever seen. Mainly because everyone in the show is written so humanly. In a context where clich&eacute; could so have so easily won the day, especially in terms of race, crime, sex or violence; this show decides to go deeper.And don't forget to watch for Omar; a character so original, and almost appallingly visceral in his appeal, you wonder why no one ever wrote and executed someone like this character before this show.	5.0	About as close to sublime as TV gets	2014-06-29	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AJYGQV81FSFE2	Timothy P. Scanlon	"What can I say that others haven't said? Except, maybe, that I reviewed the second season before reviewing the first. I took a liking to The Wire when it first came on, then became quickly addicted. (Hmmm...is there a 12 step program for Wire addicts?)I've so far watched the first season on DVD twice. And, no that won't be ""it."" In fact, that's why I waited before writing this review. Because it's complex enough that it can't be described as a ""mere television show."" Others have said already that it's frightfully REAL! Look at it: half of the best television crime and drug/police-related dramas are from Baltimore. So is what happens on The Wire. Many argue--with good reason--that The Wire is an offshoot of ""The Corner,"" another good book and HBO miniseries also in Bal'mer. David Simon is Executive Producer of both; he even wrote the book ""The Corner"" (yes, available from Amazon.com) Even the actors: nearly all of those from The Corner have quite different roles in The Wire.Why is it so complicated? Well, you need to see it again and again to see how McNulty (Dominic West) got into such trouble with the police hierarchy. There's his dedication, the police bureucracy (numbers!) and the politicians, both their corruption (probably getting funds from drug dealers; ignoring the dealers' purchase of property to add to their booty) and on and on.Then it's the politics of how the police squad is put together. All of the actors are superb--and there's enough humor to make it worth watching too.Then there's the other acting/actors. You've got Omar, the local hit man, essentially in business to rile up the drug trade. He's gay in the script, yet his lover is brutally murdered by the culprits. Then there's Andre Royo's character, Bubbles. What a work of art!It's everything you could want: passion, crime, sex, violence, laughter, idiocy, family problems. Just what you wanted to see, huh? Well, I was among the several thousand who'd petitioned to bring back The Wire for a fourth season. And I'll continue to press for more seasons.By the way, a book is available on the series, ""The Wire: Truth Be Told"" which you may want to read to keep up on the series--and get lots of inside info too.

For whatever reason, I thought it was kind of boring and the overuse of foul language did nothing to spark up the story or characters.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	ALN0TTRTLHA4E	"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick"""	A lot of detective shows are from Agatha Christie land. That is a landin which the police are upright and good and in which wrongdoers lackmoral quality. A land in which the solving of crime is an intellectualexercise carried out by the superior mind. CSI is a modern example of ashow coming from Agatha Christie land, skilled crime sceneinvestigators, police and public prosecutors work to bring fiendishlycunning wrongdoers to justice.The Wire is from somewhere else all together it is from reality land.The opening to the Wire is a murder trial when an open and shut casecollapses because witnesses have been bribed. A judge asks a homicideinvestigator what has happened following the end of the trial. What hashappened is that a new gang has moved into the public housing areas andtaken over the illegal drug trade. This gang has carried out at leastten murders and beaten three homicide charges. The Judge makes somecalls to try to get an investigation started into the gang.The response from the law enforcement agencies is one of outrage thatthey have been required to do some work. A number of police arereleasedfrom different departments who are seen as incompetent by their bosses.(Why lose a good officer to some other agency who will get the praisefor what they do and not you.)  The new task force is told to make somecosmetic arrests and to wind up the operation. The original homicideinvestigator who tipped of the Judge is called McNulty. He isimmediately seen by his superiors as a trouble maker who is distractingthem from doing what they like to do which is clear up homicides. Closethe file and give it to a DA but not be really concerned if there willbe a conviction or if the gang who carried out the hit will be closeddown. McNulty wants to do things and must be leaned on.The series is remarkable as it must be seen as a whole. The episodes donot stand alone well and what makes the series good is the portrayal ofthe dynamics of the operation and the reality of dealing with seriousdrug crime. Over the series each of the members of the unit is affectedby what they are doing. Some who are have been incompetent start tolearn the complexity of serious police work. Others who were wronglysidelined are able to demonstrate their skills and the depth of theirknowledge. Others just fail and fall by the wayside.This is only half the story. One of the key attractions of the seriesis the realistic portrayal of the drug trafficking gang. No cardboardcut out villains like in Agatha Christie but characters who have beendealt certain cards in life and know how to play them. Violence andmurder are the key to survival and the running of the gang. Yet some ofthe characters have a certain nobility. Of course to achievesignificantevil gang members have to have sufficient skills to lead and inspiretheir followers in what they do. If they have no skills they would beineffectual criminals.The quality of the writing in the series is outstanding. Watching thisseries (I saw half of it during a weekend) one realizes the hackneyednature of so much that passes for crime fiction. The dialogue is greatand the characterization is such that one is drawn to all thecharacterseven the most flawed. It is hard to think of a better police series.	5.0	Simply the best	2006-04-10	23	20	3

I took a chance on the 1st season of this show after seeing it on sale in a local electronics store ad for $20.  Needless to say, I was totally blown away by the acting and actually didn't think my regular viewing of episodes of Law & Order SVU were as good anymore.  Watch this show and you'll see what I mean by the exceptional acting on this show. It could have something with being allowed more creative freedom from being on cable as opposed to network TV but it is that good. Watch the first three episodes at least. It hooks you in with the behind the scenes street drug dealing and the police work and wire tapping that go behind the case to try and bring the dealers down.  A MUST have!

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2MMZU6XIDYFLI	"Villager ""Ettienne Brule"""	This show drops us into the on-going struggle between the Baltimore Police and the drug dealers. It introduces us to a large cast of characters - each with his own quirks, idiosyncrasies, and desires. Some of the drug dealers are stone cold killers - Wee-Bey Brice - but others are struggling to reconcile their profession with their growing consciences - D'Angelo &#34;D&#34; Barksdale. The main investigation is effectively led by two rogue cops who do not care where their investigation leads, while the police management desperately try to contain the fallout from information turned up on the ruling elite of Baltimore. We meet junkies, strippers, and other denizens of the streets and see the heroes inside them struggling to get out, and we meet one of the scariest predators of the city - Omar, who steals exclusively from the drug dealers themselves. This shows uses a driving, exciting story to present the whole of a city and I find it a very satisfying and wonderful show to watch.	5.0	The Wire is simply the best TV series of all time	2014-06-10	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AFP8MM8ZPIQJM	"Vipashina ""Vipashina Buddha Om Ah Hum"""	The Wire was obviously written by anti-American socialist Hollywood liberals wanting to legalize drugs - verify it on the Wikipedia bio of the writer David Leibowitz Simon and on the Wikipedia page the The Wired.The left-wing show writer Simon actually supports creating a socialist police state - read the footnotes on the Wikipedia article. Quite over-the-top vulgar-profanity in each scene.  Sad. There are much better cop shows on TV.During a November 2013 speech at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas in Sydney, Simon said that America has become &#34;a horror show&#34; of savage inequality as a result of capitalism run amok, and that &#34;unless we reverse course, the average human being is worth less on planet Earth. Unless we take stock of the fact that maybe socialism and the socialist impulse has to be addressed again; it has to be married as it was married in the 1930s, the 1940s and even into the 1950s, to the engine that is capitalism.&#34;Too bad so many HBO shows feel the need to pepper all of the dialogue with copious amounts of profanity-vulgarity and soft porn scenes.Since HBO does not carry &#34;normal&#34; commercials, this relieves HBO from some pressures to tone down controversial aspects of its programs, and allows for more explicit content to be incorporated into its shows that would not be allowed to air on broadcast television or basic cable, such as graphic violence, sexual situations and profanity. This show is a good example of that, along with the insanely profane HBO show Deadwood.	1.0	Written by anti-American socialist Hollywood liberals wanting to legalize drugs	2014-06-30	5	2	3

Interesting insights into the street drug trade and dark-side of the ghetto culture.  I can attest that the streets and housing a real Baltimore, not some studio backlot in Television City.  Drawback is the very difficult ghetto dialect if you don't speak the language, which I don't.  It is quite a task to wade through the dialog, learning as you go. This task may be more effort than many are willing to make. This series isn't for them.	4.0	Riveting Series on the Streets of Baltimore	2014-06-13	0	0	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A1IGSX0XJ9D71U	Weedyburton	I've read about how good of a show The Wire is for years now, so I decided to give it a try. I was skeptical at the beginning because the first episode felt like just another formulaic cop/crime drama. Fortunately, I persevered and was pleasantly surprised by how well written and well acted this show really is. It was an interesting exploration of the far reaching effects and influence of the drug culture, both criminally and politically, in Baltimore. The characters have a depth to them that I have seen in very few other shows and the primary story line was engaging up until the very end. l would highly recommend this show to anyone seeking a quality program and I am excited to start on season two so I can see how all of the characters evolve.	5.0	Give it a chance and you will be rewarded!	2014-07-12	0	0	0
B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2W7GQG04QCEVT	Wendell	"I'm another one who loves this series. It's as intelligent and credible and complex as everyone says. I love that the filmmakers respect us as the audience, respects the skills of the actors and the work of the writers and even respects the criminals that are so much a part of the story. If you like your crime dramas one-dimensional this is not going to sit well with you. There are times when you really quite like some of the bad guys and when you despise some of the ""good"" guys. For this viewer, at least, that feels like real life.Watch this if you like dramas like Homicide: Life of the Streets, Deadwood, Six Feet Under, The Sopranos. I know those are all quite different, but they're at the same high level. Actually, I think The Wire is better than any of them. Ever watch The Sopranos thinking that this is pretty good stuff but that you're kinda getting tired of seeing these creeps commit random acts of violence? I felt that way through the four seasons of the series that I watched. But The Wire never feels gratuitous. It's never violent or sexy just to titillate the viewers.This is the best real life cop drama out there, in a whole different league than the glossy CSI stuff. Highly recommended. And if you do start it stick with it. The series builds slowly, picking up steam as we come to know the characters over time and as the plot becomes ever more complex."	5.0	Best of the Best	2006-03-05	11	11	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A13UZLXK6AG1K	Wendy G.	My husband turned on ep 1 of The Wire a few years ago when DirecTV ran it on their station. I sat down and thought I'd check it out. At first I was really turned off by the language- it was excessive. But then as I got into it more, I realized it was there because it was real. This is written by a guy who rode with the Baltimore PD and saw this stuff. Some of these characters are based on real people. Some of these things really happened! This series really pulls you in though and you find yourself caring for the drug dealers- the ones you think will be the &#34;bad guys&#34;. You get to see how, even in drugs, there is a &#34;code of ethics&#34;. Each season deals with a different theme- the corners, the docks, the schools, the media- and all connected with the drugs, the police, the politicians. And the opening scene of each season gives a general overview of the whole season, but you don't know what they're telling you at the time. We would save the first episode and rewatch the first scene after the season was over. Anyway, AMAZING SERIES!!!!! And I think even that word doesn't give it justice!Oh, and the cast is INCREDIBLE!!!!!! And they're everywhere now!!! I find myself saying regularly, &#34;Hey!

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AJ92K2PKUSF0L	WestCoastBestCoast	The Wire was almost cancelled for low ratings in its first season.  But HBO knew it had struck gold and The Wire remains as one of the first entries in the Golden Age of Pay TV.  Written by real Baltimore crime reporters, The Wire captures a gritty view of a city that had seen better days.  Every character has a story -- from the cops to the criminals to the crooked politicians -- that puts them on a collision course in Season 1.  But don't mistake this for your average cops-vs-robbers tale; instead it's a portrait of a system in dysfunction where everyone wishes their lot were different but none have the power to change it.	5.0	Hard to believe that it wasn't popular on TV	2014-05-25	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A3N5XIM9R2OQH0	Wheelchair Assassin	Over the last two decades I've watched a great deal of television, maybe even more than the average for my generation, and out of all of it The Wire is doubtless the most challenging and important show I've ever seen, leaving even other classics like The Shield and The Sopranos in its dust, and this first season remains its defining document.  All thirteen of these episdoes are filled with amazingly detailed and complex storytelling, sharp characterization, and endless insights into the nature of modern crime and punishment--and they're mighty exciting to watch, to boot.  The whole season covers the participants in a single case, as an impromptu squad of cops is assembled to bring down the housing-project drug empire of Avon Barksdale and Stringer Bell, but the implications of the investigation, and the show's ambitions, stretch far beyond one tiny front in the interminable drug war.  We watch the case, built almost entirely on electronic surveillance (hence the title) come together piece by piece from the ground up, with the emotional stakes and social relevance being ratcheted up consistently along the way, right up until a harrowing conclusion that takes up the last two episodes.  Watching the Wire, one thing is certain: Law and Order this ain't; you'll be thinking about it a lot longer afterward.Even if nothing else, season one of The Wire would be notable for its narrative structure, which represents a new twist of the serialized TV format-the visual novel, with everything connected, so an event that happens in one episode can be referenced seven or eight episodes later and the viewer had better know what's going on.  The season is deliberately structured in a novelistic format, with individual episodes making up the chapters, so watching, say, the ninth episdoe of this season will get you nowhere except a state of abject confusion.  Thanks to its narrative flow, the Wire is easily the most naturalistic show I've ever watched, as the progression of events from the season's beginning to its end never feels forced or contrived.  This format demands a lot of the viewer, as it practically requires you to watch nonstop without blinking or looking away from the screen, but it proves so rewarding you'll probably want to anyway.That having been said, I can actually understand why this show's viewership is so limited (and it is REALLY limited; check the numbers).  For many, The Wire will probably be so lifelike and believable that it doesn't even function as entertainment.  In that sense, the show's greatest strength is also its (only) weakness, as there's nothing remotely sensationalistic or cliched about it, no reliance on overdirected action scenes, contrived cliffhanger endings, or improbable plot twists, which right away separates it from pretty much everything on network TV.  For all involved, the season is filled with setbacks, frustrations, and long periods of waiting for something to happen, just like real life.  The action quotient is also a lot lower than you'll find on a show like The Shield, and what violence there is is frequently disturbing, but it's always employed with a purpose, rather than just for the sake of mindless entertainment (make no mistake, I'm not opposed to a little mindless violence from time to time, but The Wire makes far more effective use of it).  The world is made to look as and feel as real as possible, as though you're actually there-no dream sequences, no haunting visions, only one extremely brief flashback-an emphasis on realism that extends to the most seemingly insignificant bits of setting and dialogue.  It all adds up to a show that's unfailingly convincing and authentic, but definitely not for those looking for an escape.Hmmm, how else can I count the ways in which The Wire wipes the floor with its competition?  Well, for another thing, the scope is just so much wider than any other crime show's, going far beyond even The Shield (a great show, but still an also-ran in comparison to The Wire) in capturing the workings of an American city in the early 21st century. David Simon himself has said the show's principal focus is on how institutions affect (and are affected by) individuals, and The Wire casts a decidely unflinching light on the functions and dysfunctions of the groups it examines.  Anyone who's part of an institution-in this case a police force, a court system or a large-scale drug organization-has to compromise his individuality to a certain extent, and the show perfectly captures the conflicts that come with the tough decisions the real world requires of its characters.  The only truly independent character on the show is Omar Little, the freelance street operator who makes his living robbing drug dealers, and he has to make the tradeoff of constant threats on his life.  The world of The Wire is a difficult and unforgiving one, where having a conscience can get you killed while someone infinitely more vicious walks, and where conscientious cops can lose out to those who know how to play the game.In yet another break with convention, there's no Tony Soprano/Vic Mackey/Greg House-style main character here around whom everything is required to revolve, at least to some extent-The Wire is about the story, and while the characters are hardly interchangeable or inconsequential, the emphasis is on fitting them all into the whole universe the show inhabits.  That said, everyone depicted in this season, from the junkies and street dealers to high-ranking cops and politicians inhabiting halls of power, is played brilliantly.  Although there isn't really a main character per se, Dominic West is sort of a first among equals as Jimmy McNulty, the self-righteous, insubordinate, irresponsible detective who turns the case into a personal crusade to prove his superior intelligence and frequently succeeds.  For all his flaws, Jimmy's a man's man, the kind of guy you can't help but like, especially since he really is smarter than pretty much everyone else around him.  After West, the biggest impression among the wire team is probably made by Lance Reddick as Cedric Daniels, the almost impossibly intense, glaring leader whose initially suspect dedication steadily grows over the course of the season.  Backing them is a whole crew of memorable characters, from the odd-couple pairing of loutish white detective Herc (Domenick Lombardozzi) and his smooth black partner Carver (Seth Gilliam); to Jimmy's trash-talking, cigar-chomping partner Bunk Moreland (Wendell Pierce); to paternal, wisdom-dispensing ex-homicide detective Lester Freamon (Clarke Peters); and of course abrasive, venal Major Bill Rawls (John Doman), who manages to save his best vitriol for Jimmy.Unlike the typical crime drama, though, The Wire's focus doesn't stop with the cops, providing a ground-up view of the inner workings of the Bell-Barksdale drug operation, from the lowest street dealers to the two leaders.  The wire team's targets aren't just plot devices, nor are they slobbering, inhuman evildoers; rather; the Barksdale-Bell Crew are just as sharply drawn and fleshed out as anyone else, with an operation whose corporate structure and intricate business practices are just as pure a distillation of American capitalism as any legitimate company's.  The incredible Idris Elba, especially, leaves an impression as Stringer, the smooth, highly intelligent, and icily calculating lieutenant who oversees Avon's operations, but he's hardly alone.  Wood Harris is all intensity all the time as Avon, while Larry Gilliard Jr. as Avon's conscience-stricken nephew D'Angelo captures all of his character's emotional conflicts without any undue melodrama.  As a whole, the experiences of the Bell-Barksdale crew provide a sad commentary on the lives of unwanted blacks in housing projects nationwide-many of them have the intelligence and motivation to be doing other things, but isolated from the mainstream of society there's nothing else for them to do.  The game is all they have, whether they want to be involved or not.So, yeah, that's pretty much it.  The emergence of TV as a respectable medium (especially in comparison to the movies) over the past decade or so has been well documented, and The Wire is definitely one of the shows leading the charge.  The show's subsequent seasons, while indisputably brilliant and still better than pretty much anything else out there, have watered down the show's formula just a little bit as they branch out in all sorts of directions, but no matter.  This season stands alone as one of the decade's crowning visual achievements.  Easily worth the time and money you'll invest in it, especially for how much time you'll spend thinking about it afterwards.	5.0	Even superlatives aren't enough	2006-10-26	315	297	18

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	AAV0AIUP8SKYD	Will Alston	"Of course to ""Listen Carefully"" refers to police undercover investigative work, but I'd like to believe the creators of this incredible series are literally imploring US to listen to The Wire carefully, and to watch carefully also; in order to totally imbibe the MANY rich, colorful, and exciting nuances of these amazing episodes that may be lost on those who are impatient.Indeed, as other reviewers may have noted, the full essence of The Wire may not appeal to the intelligence-challenged, quicky-dicky bang-bang shoot-'em-up mentality of persons that find it a bit of a chore to think.But if you've ever experienced the joy and exilaration of just having finished reading a good book and leaned back with a smile and a whispered, ""WOW that was good!"" you'll understand why I enthusiastically took other reviewers' hearty advice and just purchased the complete SECOND season of The Wire also.It was OFTEN during this Complete First Season that I was delighted to exclaim, ""..this is great stuff!And although the acting and directing was superb, most significant to me was the incredibly high caliber of writing!So while you enthusiastically watch, also...

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A14WCM5XDC1UT3	William Capodanno	"TV does not get any better than ""The Wire"".  There are only a handful of shows that I've seen that even come close this exceptional series (most of them also from HBO).  ""The Wire"" excels in every aspect that makes for great TV -- first rate story-telling, superb acting, deep, complex and multi-dimensional character development, frighteningly realistic sense of place and masterful dialogue.This is not a show for the weak of heart.  There are neat bow ties to tightly wrap up things.  Life if brutal in the streets of Baltimore.  A once proud, but economically distressed city that is mostly about the past and not the future.  Politics is a rough and tumble affair and the streets are rule by local drug lords protecting their turf and profits.  ""The Wire"" knocks you upside the head with a view into this reality -- undermanned police one step behind the drug crews, citizens threatened from testifying for fear of losing their life, kids chewed up and spit out by the drug dealers and dysfunctional bureaucracy more concerned with stats than with lives.Season 1 is 13 riveting episodes, each more addicting than the other. All of this adds up to one of the most fresh and original series ever made."	5.0	The Best thing to happen to Baltimore since Ripken	2009-06-24	0	0	0

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A159HCMVT1MURH	xray97	"Many reviews of this have already said things that I would, so will not say those things. ""The Wire"" is an indescribable show, and I truly believe it to be the best show of all time. I cannot believe it has not won any awards. But that says more about those awards than about the ""The Wire"".""The Wire"" is even an educational show, and shows us a lot about what's happened to America in recent years. It teaches us about institutions and individuals, and how they overlap. Even superlatives can't describe ""The Wire"".Much humor in this show comes from the ignorance of the dealers, and the antics of Sgt. Jay Landsman (Delaney Williams). Williams easily steals every scene he is in. It seems unfair to point out standouts, but hey, life is unfair. Standouts are Williams as Landsman, Dominic West as the epically insubordinate Det. Jimmy McNulty, and Idris Elba as ""Stringer"" Bell.Whatever reviewer said that this is not one of HBO's great shows is an idiot. This is HBO's greatest show.

B0002ERXC2	The Wire: Season 1	A2YC1TYEXEB6ZW	Yarn Whisperer	"The only downside to this DVD set is that it does not contain enough extras and commentary. The show itself differs from nearly everything else on television. It is more like a book than a TV show -- specifically, more like ""Homicide"" and ""The Corner"" both by writer and series co-creator David Simon (buy them, read them.) Simon was a journalist in Baltimore who developed both of the above books after spending months as a sort of ""embedded"" journalist with the homicide detectives of the Baltimore P.D. and, later, with the people on the front lines of the drug war. ""The Wire"" is far more slowly paced than other shows in the sense that each season forms a story arc, with no single episode wrapping up many details. Each episode, however, opens up the characters' lives a little more, following the detectives and the dealers and the drug addicts as they pursue and elude each other and one another.  To appreciate ""The Wire"" you need an attention span and the will to use it. This is not entertainment rinsed of realism and grit and presented to you in a sterile, cotton-padded package with a pretty little bow on top, and that's why it's such a breath of fresh air."	5.0	"Think of ""The Wire"" as a book, not a TV show ... and a good book, at that"	2005-08-12	7	7	0
