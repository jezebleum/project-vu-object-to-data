It is funny because as it turns out, I enjoyed watching it.  Colin Firth does an amazing performance as Mr. Darcy.  His presence dominates even though he may hardly speak a word at times.I would definitely recommend that husbands buy this for their wives...and actually watch it with them!

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3EYEZ5NH2HFFY	Abbys	&quot;PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is the story of the lively and rebellious Elizabeth Bennet, one of the five unmarried daughters living in the country side of the 19th century England. In the world where obtaining an advantageous marriage is a woman's sole occupation. Elizabeth's independent manner threatens her family's future. Will her romantic sparring with the mysterious and arrogant Darcy end in misfortune - or will love's true nature prevail?&quot; --copied from the back description of the DVD cover itself.The MOVIE concentrates on the three (of 5) Bennet sisters: ELIZABETH: I was quite taken by her from the very start. She is indeed lively, outspoken, smart and independent. Mr. Darcy however was hard to like in the beginning. He hardly smiles. So arrogant that I wanted to swat him. hehe. But as the film progress, you will eventually like him. He might be High-and-Mighty but he is helplessly in love. Ha! Their love story's a touchy one. My favorite scene is Mr. Darcy's proud confession to Elizabeth's as well as their unexpected meeting in one of Mr. Darcy's estate. I can blabber all day about them, really. JANE: Elizabeth's elder sister was described as the most beautiful of all the Bennet sisters and indeed she is. I liked her as well. She is gentlier and very refined. A bit too good of a heart but still realistically humane. I too like Mr. Bingley from the start. He is a gentleman through and through. Very friendly, polite and handsome in his own right. Perhaps a little blind, dense but this is what made their love story longing... Both a lovely match! Meanwhile, the infamous LYDIA, youngest of the Bennet girls is a pain in the behind. Young, impetuous and ambitious. She deserves the wayward. Mr. Wickam on every turn. These three different and challenging love story made this film very captivating from start to end. Truly A Classic. Classic at its best!After reading the book, I searched for the movie and learned its limitation. This movie is not even available for rent in Blockbuster or Hollywood Video. My sister eventually lent me her DVD copy and now I am thinking of not returning it (until I get a copy of my very own, of course). :-) I have read more than 80 historical romance novels in this year alone and watching this movie truly connected me with my books. It soared my heart. It's only been in my mind that I picture clothings and backgrounds of the books I've read through the authors' descriptions so seeing it first hand on film simply enthralled me. Their attires, the castle's, great mansions, the carriages, the freshly green and brown of the countrysides, the Soiree, Waltz and other dance steps... It's just beautiful! The music is an added wonder to this film. I even ordered the soundtrack already. Overall, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a must see, especially if you are into romance genre with 18th-19th century setting. I find the courtship, dialogue and ways of living of that time period rather fascinating. I suggest you read the book as well before or after this movie. Watch this one and be &quot;AWED&quot;.Note: Since this movie was derived from A&amp;E's TV shows as a series, it is not played continuesly as one movie would. It is in about 6-7 segments, which I had to fast forward to skip introductory contents to see the next fragments. This didn't bother me one bit though, I just thought I'd mention this to others.	5.0	Classic at its best...	2001-07-11	6	5	1

I liked all of the production elements within this movie. It is very good and any fan of Jane Austin's work will probably enjoy this. My only points of contention are with the casting (the aunt &amp; does Colin Firth ever smile?)and occational &quot;dumming-down&quot; of the original text. If you want a alternate version check out the 1982 version from the BBC. The sets aren't as nice but the casting and language are much more in line with the book.	4.0	Good but...	2000-12-12	11	3	8

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2GDEPPC8BAZRY	"A. Casalino ""V^^^^^V"""	&quot;That a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.&quot;  So commences what is very likely the purest and most marvelous work of fiction in the English speaking world - And thus, as would be well fitting, ventures to introduce Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet, our undaunted heroine, in this brilliant A&amp;E production of the same.Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is undoubtedly the most beloved work of literature contained in the whole of my vast library.  I should therefore find myself hard pressed to ever discover a movie adaptation even approaching the magic of that flawless story. Yet - low and behold - in this wonderful movie I'm sure I've actually found something coming close...quite close indeed!Miss Ehle and Colin Firth are simply lovely as Miss Bennet and Mr. Darcy.  The pair have a wonderful chemistry, and this is definitely the best work that either have performed in the whole of their careers.  Truly, they seem to have been born to play these roles!  Supporting them is a cast amazingly well chosen for this so daintily woven tale of romance and self-discovery evolving within the intricacies of civilized manners and politics of the gentry in Regency England.Alison Steadman and Benjamin Whitrow are perfect as the famously mismatched pair, Mr. And Mrs. Bennet, the parents of five daughters - Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and Lydia.  Mr. Bennet is a country gentleman with a modest estate, which is unfortunately to be entailed away upon a distant cousin, Mr. Collins, in default of heirs male.  His wife therefore spends much of her time preoccupied with trying to get her daughters married and obsessing over the state of her nerves.  Mr. Bennet, on the other hand, spends much of his time in his study reading and sipping brandy.When a neighboring estate is let to Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, Mrs. Bennet is simply beside herself with the rapturous anticipation of his being introduced to her daughters and, in good turn, marrying one of them.  Mr. Bingley arrives with his two sisters and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who it is soon discovered has a fortune and estate of over twice Mr. Bingley's worth.  Mr. Darcy, however, is aloof and somewhat haughty - characteristics that quickly make him unpopular.  Bingley, on the other hand, is friendly and outgoing, and is almost immediately taken by the charms of Jane, the eldest Miss Bennet.  Jane and Mr. Bingley quickly fall in love.  Yet with the differences in status and fortune, as well as the rather frequent improprieties exhibited by Jane's mother and three youngest sisters, the couple's road to happiness is to be a rocky one at best.At the heart of this movie is Elizabeth, whose graceful charm, sharp wit, and intelligence catch the eyes of Mr. Darcy, who gradually comes to feel a passion for her against his own will.  Elizabeth, who is for quite some time oblivious to this, is meanwhile aware of the attentions of two other suitors:  Mr. Collins, the heir to her father's estate, and Mr. Wickham, a soldier in a regiment stationed nearby.  Mr. Collins is a fawning, silly man, quite ill favored for such a pretty, clever heroine, and Mr. Wickham, though attractive and good-natured, doesn't quite make the sparks fly for Lizzy.The sparks do fly, however, in every single scene of interaction between Darcy and Elizabeth.  His &quot;pride&quot; and her &quot;prejudice&quot; go down the dance in perfect eloquence.  Every phrase, every look or expression, every manner of movement between them speaks volumes.I only have a couple criticisms to this movie, and they are minor, indeed:  first, I would like to have seen Lizzy exhibit a little more softness of feeling and understanding toward her mother and younger sisters, especially her mother, whose first priority is to see her children well settled and secure in life - a valid concern which, to all appearances, her husband does not seem to share.  In the novel, Lizzy understood this, and though those precious little offerings were very subtle, they were always there beneath the admonitions and sighs of frustration.  Ehle's Lizzy appears most of the time to rather disdain their existence.  Yet I see this as a flaw with the script and not with the actress.  Another little problem I had with this film was how Mr. Wickham was presented.  In the novel, he was more physically attractive than Mr. Darcy, and his personality was very open and warm.  From the moment Adrian Lukis' Wickham first appears, one can see he's just a little bit shady.  I don't think he hid his true nature well enough to attract someone as sharp as our Elizabeth Bennet.  My final criticism applies to the dvd version only:  for some reason, the soft, warm coloring is gone.  Everyone looks quite pallid and washed up.  Though it's inconvenient to change tapes six different times, I still very much prefer my vhs to the dvd.Finally, all I can say is that this A&amp;E presentation is not only the very best film adaptation of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ever made, it is the finest movie I own!	5.0	&quot;It Is A Truth Universally Acknowledged,...	2003-03-06	3	3	0

The picture and audio are not super terrible, it is just that it was a lot better on the VHS!  Why did they mess it up like this?!  The program itself is fantastic and I highly recommend it.

People these days walk on eggshells to avoid offending blacks and gays and Jews and femminists who will have a tempoer tantrum over even accidental offenses against them, but they think nothing of offending God by misusing his name. The use of Blasphemy in this movie is anachronistic, and even if the people making this movie don't believe in God, they don't seem to care that they are offending the people who do believe in God with that kind of language. I bought it because 19th century life was clean, and I am deeply dissapointed because it is another example of what i call ""Cafeteria Bigotry,"" whereby one preaches tolerance and respect for other's opinion, while in actuality they are hypocritically  selecting which groups they mind offending, and which groups they don't mind offending."	1.0	Serious artistic and technical flaws	2002-09-25	110	8	102

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A8OW4IFVA58XC	Adele Rothman	The film follows the novel faithfully; the casting and acting is superb.  For instance, Jennifer Ehrle is the perfect Elizabeth, with beautiful dark eyes, sweetness and wit.  Colin Firth creates a fuller Darcy from the limited information provided in the text.  Often he must appear without speaking, and his eyes convey not only haughtiness, but also intelligence and vulnerability.  The only casting I would take issue with is Adrian Lukis as Wickham. His effeteness perhaps sets the stage for the revelation of his perfidy, but he is neither handsome enough nor suave enough to give credence to Elizabeth's initial strong attraction to him.  Therefore, the central plot twist of Elizabeth's revelation that she has championed Wickham because his preference for her was flattering while Darcy on first  acquaintance had insulted her loses force; Wickham is too insipid to be a general favorite  or a believable counterforce to Darcy.The personalities and appearances of many of the other characters -- such as Mrs. Bennet, Caroline  Bingley, and Mr. Collins -- were delightfully exaggerated, and the enactment of the idiosyncracies of each provides wonderful detail and many hilarious moments.The sets, the costumes, the props, the interior and exterior of Darcy's estate at Pemberly all contribute to the realization of the essence of the novel.  Reading the novel enhances seeing the film and vice versa.Without a doubt this is the best of the Austen novels brought to the screen; it is an Austen admirer's dream.  Viewing the entire film takes about six hours, and I would advise you to start early because once you begin you'll want to go straight through to the end.	5.0	Pride and Prejudice	2001-01-18	3	3	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A10DBOCIAQIV5	"""adlyspozas4"""	What is most lovely about this adaptation of Pride and and Prejudice is how true the screenplay remains to the novel. Indeed, Andrew Davies could not have done a better job of following the narrative of Austen's beloved novel. The characters, the plot, and the composition so closely parallel the novel that one can hardly tell the difference between the book and the film. Colin Firth as Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth burn up the screen. One wishes that more than arch looks and longing glances could pass between the two. This reviewer can most honestly say that of all the films based on Jane Austen's novels this is by far the best. I, myself, watch it every opportunity I get.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AK0GX611XUKN2	Adrian C Keister	I have to admit liking this version about as well as the earlier version with Garvie and Rintoul. They each have their strengths. They are both very well done.My first (of two) complaints about this version is that Susannah Harker (Jane), although she has her moments of startling beauty in this movie, is not so universally beautiful as Sabina Franklyn (the actress who played Jane in the earlier version). She is supposed to be more beautiful than Elizabeth, a point of no small importance. In the earlier version, she was more beautiful. In this version, although as I said she has her moments, Jennifer Ehle far outstrips her.My second complaint is rather complicated. In Mr. Darcy's climactic letter to Elizabeth, he fails to mention (as he does in the book and in the earlier version) that after he found the law to be unprofitable, Mr. Wickham re-applied for the living that was supposed to have been his before. While this point is mentioned elsewhere in the movie, I think it certainly ought to have been mentioned here. Otherwise, why would Mr. Wickham have a motive for wanting to revenge himself upon Mr. Darcy? A viewer would either have to read the book, or gather the information himself in order to understand this important point.Otherwise, this version is quite accurate, and very enjoyable to watch. I have already seen it twice in the space of two days. The fact that I am taking the trouble to write about such small details indicates that I value this movie very much. I highly recommend it!	5.0	Small Error	2001-07-09	1	1	0

Other more recent versions have cut out those elements of the character development that make these people so watchable.  It is a movie I watch over and over every year.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1B9KEI00CMOC6	"Aleksandra ""therevaleks"""	"This production is a masterpiece of the time period with high quality actors in the roles. It held my interest throughout the film, the characters are realistic, and believable. Colin Firth (Mr. Darcy) is a brilliant British actor. Personally, I find him much more attractive and appealing in Darcy's role than Sir Lawrence Olivier's performance. Firth's stature, manners, bearing, dark good looks, brusqueness, yet emotional insecurity combines well with Ehle's confident personality as Elizabeth for their on-screen ""attraction""-- a perfect match. I was kept guessing, though had a niggling feeling they would eventually come together and discover their attraction, and that they are just right for each other.The actress playing the four girl's mother kept me laughing (or snickering) at her marvelous interpretation of the mother's personality: a person who is a bit ditsy, always on the verge of hysteria and ill equipped to deal with the problems that arise having four young women as daughters that she is MOST determined ""to marry off"" to men worthy of them, in her eyes. The father is wonderfully portrayed as calm, sensible, good natured, tolerant toward his wife, and  most capable of making excellent decisions regarding his children and their financial circumstances--if only his wife would allow him to get a word in edgewise and listen to his wisdom (though possible only infrequently). The sisters were well cast, particularly Jennifer Ehle; she's perfect as Elizabeth Bennet. She has her head together combined with very spirited wit and verbal reparte skills; she is so calm, cool, collected, and wise. ""Her feathers aren't easily ruffled"" by anyone, and she always has a quick, appropriate retort readily available when someone oversteps social decorum or attempts to put her or her family down in some way. You keep wondering whether Firth and Ehle will discover that in reality, they are perfect for each other if they'd just open their hearts to the possibility, rather than constantly bantering with each other over moot points while conversing. Extremely well done production--must see!"	5.0	Will they or won't they?	2008-04-13	2	2	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1S26JXPQKFVPI	Alexander Arsov	"""Pride and Prejudice"": A Quadruple Video ReviewThe following is an attempt for a (hopefully not too comparative) review of four different movie versions which span more than six decades of film-making and which I have had the (dis)pleasure of seeing in the last few weeks or so. Considering the vast cast of accomplished character actors with perfect diction that Pride and Prejudice requires, not to mention sensitive screenwriter, imaginative director and fanatical production designer, it is no surprise that many film adaptations should be rife with shortcomings. It is nothing short of amazing that at least one of those four - the 1995 one, of course - comes somewhere near perfection.Anyway, enough preliminary remarks. Let's have a look at the movies. The full details about the four versions I am going to discuss are as follows:1940, MGM, 118 min.Cast:Lizzy - Greer GarsonDarcy - Laurence OlivierJane - Maureen O'SullivanLydia - Ann RutherfordMary - Marsha HuntKitty - Heather AngelMrs Bennet - Mary BolandMr Bennet - Edmund GwennMr Bingley - Bruce LesterCaroline Bingley - Frieda InescortMr Collins - Melville CooperMr Wickham - Edward AshleyLady Catherine - Edna May Oliver.Screenplay by Aldous Huxley and Jane Murfin, based on the dramatisation by Helen Jerome.Directed by Robert Z. Leonard.1980, BBC, TV Mini-Series, 5 episodes, ca. 265 min. overall.Cast:Lizzy - Elizabeth GarvieDarcy - David RintoulJane - Sabina FranklynLydia - Natalie OgleMary - Tessa Peake-JonesKitty - Clare HigginsMrs Bennet - Priscilla MorganMr Bennet - Moray WatsonMr Bingley - Osmund BullockCaroline Bingley - Marsha FitzalanMr Collins - Malcolm RennieMr Wickham - Peter SettelenLady Catherine - Judy Parfitt.Screenplay by Fay Weldon.Directed by Cyril Coke.1995, BBC, TV Mini-Series, 6 episodes, ca. 300 min. overall.Cast:Lizzy - Jennifer EhleDarcy - Colin FirthJane - Susannah HarkerLydia - Julia SawalhaMary - Lucy BriersKitty - Polly MaberlyMrs Bennet - Alison SteadmanMr Bennet - Benjamin WhitrowMr Bingley - Crispin Bonham-CarterCaroline Bingley - Anna ChancellorMr Collins - David BamberMr Wickham - Adrian LukisLady Catherine - Barbara Leigh-Hunt.Screenplay by Andrew Davies.Directed by Simon Langton.2005, Focus Features, 127 min.Cast:Lizzy - Keira KnightleyDarcy - Matthew MacfadyenJane - Rosamund PikeLydia - Jena MaloneMary - Talulah RileyKitty - Carey MulliganMrs Bennet - Brenda BlethynMr Bennet - Donald SutherlandMr Bingley - Simon WoodsCaroline Bingley - Kelly ReillyMr Collins - Tom HollanderMr Wickham - Rupert FriendLady Catherine - Judi Dench.Screenplay by Deborah Moggach.Directed by Joe Wright.=============================================The 1940 version I have wanted to see mostly because I have recently fallen in love with Laurence Olivier (and with his second wife but that's another story). I was rather surprised to find a sumptuous production of considerable merit. The liberties taken with the novel are great - but not as great as you might expect from a Hollywood production in the early 1940s.This is the version that Austen purists should never see, or if they do they might perhaps spare us, the common mortals, their relentless nit-picking. Yes, Greer Garson doesn't look twenty, but neither does she look much older. Certainly, the costumes are historically completely inappropriate as they were obviously ripped off from the legendary production of Gone With the Wind that was released just one year before. To be sure, this wild chase with carriages and this monumental outdoor ball are also more reminiscent of the American South from the second half of the nineteenth century than of the English countryside in the first one. There are countless other changes and omissions of this nature. None of them is in any way detrimental to the movie - at least as long as you are not an Austen fanatic.That said, there is one - but only one - significant departure from the novel which is absolutely unforgivable. Many a reviewer has remarked on it, and every one of them has been justly outraged. This is the transformation of Lady Catherine into a matchmaker. Yes, I'm afraid you've read that right. It is entirely out of character and it ruins one of the finest scenes in the novel. It may also be mentioned as a negative criticism that the script could have quoted Jane's flawless dialogue more often than it actually did. The replacements invariably have more sugar and less bite than the original.Nevertheless, despite all these drawbacks, and keeping in mind that compressing the novel into less than two hours is an impossible task by default, the 1940 version remains a highly entertaining movie. With the obvious exception of Lady Catherine, the essence of the other characters is very much preserved. This is doubtless due to a great cast that is often grossly underestimated.Greer Garson may not be the most youthful Elizabeth imaginable, but she is certainly among the wittiest and most charming ones I have encountered so far. She strikes a perfect balance between the spirited and the introverted moments. Among the quartet discussed here, Olivier's Darcy is unique: his pride stems from prodigious sense of humour, his disdain is always mingled with a thin ironic smile. Can you stomach that? I find it refreshing and stimulating. Also, he is by far the handsomest one. The change of heart in both principals, which is of course the heart of the movie as well as of the novel, is acted beautifully.The supporting cast boast some superb performances. Unusually crafty Mrs Bennet and quietly ironic Mr Bennet stand out. The dashing Mr Wickham, the venomous Caroline Bingley and the pompous Mr Collins may almost have stepped out of Jane's pages. Ironically, the weakest performance of all is the only misrepresented part in the script. I do not share the general exaltation over Edna May Oliver. She makes Lady Catherine too much of a caricature.Altogether a lovely movie very much in the spirit of Jane Austen, warts and all. Strictly forbidden for Austen addicts. Highly recommended for ordinary Austen admirers.---------------------------------The 1980 version baffles me no end. How some people can hail this as the best adaptation ever, especially considering the 1995 series, is well beyond me. The best that can be said about this movie is that it keeps close to the novel and that its extensive length allows the luxury of but a few omissions. But the production is drab and the direction is dull.The cast is at best questionable. Elizabeth Garvie is a cute and rather delightful Lizzy, although she tends to downplay the character too much. Still, she is way superior to this dull stick David Rintoul. He looks like an orangutan, he moves like one, and he sounds like a robot. If there ever was a more wooden, artificial and just plain tedious Darcy, I have yet to meet him. He is the greatest disappointment in a production of spectacular mediocrity.Mrs Bennet's portrayal is rather accomplished though by no means exceptional. But Mr Bennet is completely devoid of his exquisite sense of humour, and he comes off as a stuffy old bore who is all but insufferably boring. None of the rest disgraces him- or herself. None makes any special impression either. I have some sneaky admiration for Mr Collins and Mr Wickham, but that's just about all. Almost the whole cast seems to have been sedated before shooting.---------------------------------The 1995 version is the zenith. It is the closest one to the novel. It is visually the most lavish, with the most wonderful cast and the most accomplished direction. Of course it is not perfect. Nothing is. But as a whole none of the other three comes even close. I very much doubt I will find its equal among other versions in the future. I am sure it cannot be surpassed.Colin Firth is my only qualm with this movie. But just like Darcy, he does improve on acquaintance. In the first three episodes he is a bit too busy looking sullen, but from the fourth onwards, after the fateful meeting with Lizzy in Pemberley, he manages his transformation rather well. That he is handsome and looks perfect for the part is no harm either. The wonderful thing is that Lizzy of Jennifer Ehle is even better than her proud suitor. She hardly looks twenty, and she could use a boost of adrenaline now and then, but she is nothing like the soporific Garvie. She has the same quiet yet compelling vivacity like Greer Garson.The supporting cast is flawless. Mr and Mrs Bennet are nailed to the last syllable; fabulous performances that would have warmed Jane's heart could she see them. So are the others. The very pretty Jane is pure goodness, not unattractive though somewhat stultifying quality. Lydia is insane and exasperating, Mary is rigidly intellectual and impossibly dull. Lady Catherine and Caroline Bingley are just about the most snobbish and condescending creatures ever to have (dis)graced the screen. Mr Wickham is a most accomplished liar and hypocrite. Perhaps only Mr Collins could have been a trifle more ridiculous, and Mr Bingley a bit more handsome, but these are very minor issues.All in all, an outstanding mini-series that should satisfy even the most ardent Austenophile.---------------------------------The 2005 version is the nadir. To begin with, it's astonishingly ugly. It looks like the Middle Ages in Asia rather than like England of the early nineteenth century. Even after making the usual allowances for omissions and changes during the adaptation, the screenplay departs from Jane's original in a most deplorable way. It is this version, not the 1940 one, which is the real travesty, if not in terms of plot at all events in terms of characters.Whoever had the bright idea of casting Keira Knightley as Lizzy did a great disservice to the future generations. I shudder to think how many people will see this movie without any prior knowledge of the novel and will think, quite mistakenly, that Keira's portrayal has anything to do with Jane's; if they ever come to read the book later, they would probably be too full of pride and prejudice to really appreciate it. Keira's vapid performance, rife with hideous grins that apparently pass for smiles, is fully matched by the worst Darcy imaginable. The proud and conceited gentleman has been scaled down to a timid and tedious creature.The supporting cast, despite the presence of such illustrious names like Donald Sutherland (Mr Bennet who speaks his generally witty lines with a funereal air) and Judi Dench (Lady Catherine who sounds much more like Lady Macbeth), is no improvement over the weak principals. There is not a trace of Mr Collins' trademark pomposity or Mrs Bennet's equally typical (and fake) hysteria. Jane is supposed to be a placid creature, but is this one entirely devoid of life! The whole cast speak their lines in the most contrived and unnatural manner. All grace, charm and vivacity of the original have been lost.There is nothing redeeming about this movie (except, perhaps, Lydia and the interlude with the marble statues). In addition to the fabulous vapidity of the acting, this includes the mediocre production, the clumsy direction, the clipped and simplified dialogue. It's all matter of taste of course. But my idea of Pride and Prejudice has nothing to do with anorexic Lizzy, moronic Darcy and a bunch of talking mannequins who seem to have no idea what their lines mean. The praise lavished on this movie, by both critics and audience, is something I really don't understand.-------------------------------------To sum up, the four movies are so different from one another that seeing them together is both fascinating and frustrating. The 1940 version is suitable only for the most broadminded among Austen admirers; if they are also fans of Laurence Olivier and/or Greer Garson, so much the better. The 1980 version is a good starter, and I can well see why it was reportedly very popular during the 1980s, but today it is of historical interest only. It has been totally and devastatingly superseded by the 1995 version. The misguided drama of the 2005 travesty is suitable for ardent admirers of Keira Knightley only. It has nothing to do with Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen."	5.0	P&P on screen through the years: 1940, 1980, 1995, 2005	2012-10-27	6	6	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AGEIT17HENDIS	Alfred Johnson	We are now in another one of those periods of revival of interest in, and appreciation of, Jane Austen. There have been at least two films, one cable one commercial, released over the past several years that are based on one of her better novels, The Pride and Prejudice. Ordinarily I have found that films made for cable are inferior to those produced for the commercial film market. Not here. The A&E; production is far superior in presentation not the least of which is that it is truer to the Austen story line than the commercial film. Moreover, as an added treat, the film itself is over five hours long and therefore can get a leisurely treatment to Austen's themes of love and life, horse riding and letter writing among the early 18th century English `squirearcy'. Despite the length the film moves along with few dull spots.And what of the story line? Well it seems that certain very rich young landowner, a Mr. Darcy, with just the right connections and, Miss Elizabeth Bennett, one of five daughters of a country squire who estate has been entailed away from any ability to provide for his wife and daughters are smitten with each other. However both parties must endure many trials and tribulations, to speak nothing of personal misunderstandings between them, before the romantic tensions can be resolved and they can snuggle down in Mr. Darcy's little mansion. On a personal level this is about overweening pride (naturally) -his- that stood for a long time in the way of unleashing his feelings is an adult way. The prejudice part comes from both parties as both are very class-conscious and committed to the, frankly, unseemly and irrationally snobbish nature of the English gentry. In the end, (since we know that the couple will ride happily into the sunset) Austen's looks at English morals, mores and manners just before the full effects of the Industrial Revolution hit that society is what drives one to watch the movie. Ms. Austen had a very good ear for picking up the language of these `gentle' people.  Damn it though, those times were tough for an independent-minded intelligent young woman with no means. Kudos to Miss Elizabeth Bennett.	4.0	pride, indeed	2007-04-23	4	4	0

And you will too if you want a true to the novel adaptation. The nuances and details that would be lost in a shorter version add strength to this one, so that, even at over four and one-half hours, Pride and Prejudice rarely loses momentum.The main plot thread traces the relationship of Elizabeth Bennet (Jennifer Ehle), the second of five sisters, and a wealthy young gentleman named Darcy (Colin Firth). The two are not immediately attracted to each other -- a fair share of pride and prejudice separates them ) -- but, as the story progresses...WELL WATCH THE MOVIE!Of course, Pride and Prejudice unfolds more than just Lizzie and Darcy's tale. There's a parallel love story between Lizzie's older sister, Jane (Susannah Harker), and the charming Mr. Bingley (Crispin Bonham-Carter). We also follow the thwarted marital plans of an odious, simpering cleric by the name of Collins (David Bamber), and learn dark secrets about the character of the seemingly open and generous Wickham (Adrian Lukis).As the critics say, "" Austen's wry, incisive humor is much in evidence. In fact, it is this quality, along with deft characterization, that prevents the movie from descending into the realm of a nicely-costumed, brilliantly-photographed melodrama. The acting is uniformly flawless. One of the most difficult aspects of adapting a classic novel is imparting the thoughts and feelings of characters to the audience without resorting to intrusive internal monologues. Ehle's expressive face and carefully-controlled body language make this a surprisingly easy task."""	5.0	True to the reality that is Pride and Prejudice and Colin Firth is quite tastey!	2011-07-02	0	0	0

I could have wished a more attractive actress for Jane--Jane after all is &quot;supposed&quot; to be prettier than Elizabeth--and I thought that the portrayal of Elizabeth's mother was a bit off the top.  But the actor who portraryed Elizabeth's father captured him perfectly.  Highly recommended.	5.0	Marvelous, simply marvelous	2001-06-01	1	1	0

It is absolutely beautiful when viewed on the right screen. On my laptop screen the scenes did look washed out. However on my new HD Sanyo flat screen TV it was breathtaking.

I was extremely pleased with the quality of the production, and I thought the dialog very faithful to the book. The main actors all interpreted their characters very well, in my opinion, and I had to stop the other BBC version I found (again, at my library) after five minutes because it was AWFUL in comparison.It is long, but it does justice to the wonderful book, and it is as good as I could have hoped.

While this version closely chronicles the book, it lacked passion and suspense.  The chemistry between Lizzie, Darcy, Jane, and Bingley was rather dull and unbelievable.The casting was off:  Jane and Lizzie were too mature...I found Darcy absolutely unapproachable...Mrs. Bennet was odiously played...Mr. Bennet lacked that sarcastic wit and timing.  Sigh.  I still prefer and love the version with Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFayden despite its adaptation.	2.0	dry and boring...not worth the time...i was misled by pos review	2007-07-12	23	12	11

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1CQ6D4JIG4C3Z	"Amazon Customer ""book addict"""	As a fan of this movie who can actually spell Jane Austen's last name (i.e. informed), I'll toss my opinion into the mix.  Or perhaps lack of mix, as all of the reviews seem to be good.I have come to the conclusion, after watching many adaptations of books, that only Peter Jackson and the BBC should be allowed to make them.  Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, but I particularly like the BBC's adaptations because they aren't afraid to make them over two hours.This adaptation cuts no corners, removes no plot elements or even minor characters.  Most of the dialog is straight from the book and the casting is perfect--the characters seemed to have stepped from the pages of Austen's masterpiece.The BBC's Pride & Prejudice proves that an adaptation CAN convey all of the wit and emotion of the book without adding in corny lines or extra plot twists to keep clueless modern viewers who haven't read the book entertained.The much-adored Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle of course play their roles to perfection, but the rest of the cast is equally stellar.Particularly brilliant are David Bamber, who plays the fumbling and obsequious Mr. Collins; Barbara Leigh-Hunt, who plays the condescending and interfering Lady Catherine de Bourgh; Alison Steadman as the nervous, shrill Mrs. Bennet; and Benjamin Whitrow playing the flippant, likeable Mr. Bennet.However, even the minor characters are perfect in their minor peculiarities: Mr. Hurst, always to be found sleeping; Mary Bennet, plain and philosophizing; even Anne de Bourgh, without a line of dialog, manages to look as if she stepped from Austen's text.Recommended for anyone and everyone.  Well, maybe not, but I've practically never heard a complaint about it.  A thoroughly enjoyable movie with the bonus of being faithful to the text.	5.0	Just another good review...	2004-12-05	12	12	0

Those of you who also saw the television version will be pleasantly surprised to discover that the restored edition DVD contains deleted scenes!  This beautifully constructed movie is a faithful reproduction of the Austen novel, and it is obvious that care was taken to ensure authenticity.  Unlike the more recent U.S. version, you will not find young ladies resting their elbows on the dinner table or prancing about unchaperoned in this movie.  The acting is superb, the costumes are historically accurate, and the dialogue comes straight from the novel.

The cast is terrific: Colin Firth is the perfect Mr. Darcy -- now I can't see him in any movie that I don't think of Darcy (I was enraged watching &quot;The English Patient&quot; because his wife was betraying him!!!); Jennifer Ehle is witty, pretty (not more than Jane), and elegant (as I'd always pictured Lizzy). They even *look like* those on the cover of the Pride and Prejudice book I have!  The adaptation is wonderful, some parts are even verbatim (I *have* watched it with the book in hand!).

I'm a big Jane Austen fan, and this film is about 95% true to the book, which is pretty darn good for any book-to-film adaptation.  I suppose it's only drawback is that it's like 5 hours long, but you can hardly call that a drawback if you like a movie so much and you just get to enjoy it twice as long as any other film.  Even my husband likes it, so it's not just a girl movie, although I imagine in general it would appeal more to women than to men, just like Austen's books generally do.

If you aren't, it's simply the best version ever made in almost every way.I'm not quite as enthusiastic about the blu-ray incarnation. I mean, it's decent. The sound is good and it's wide screen. But I confess that I am a little disappointed in the video quality. After seeing the blu-ray remastered versions of Star Trek TOS and TNG, I had high hopes. Sadly, it's a bit grainier than I was hoping. If your screen is not too large, it's probably not a big problem. But like many, ours is fairly large (105&#34;) and it's a little grainy.It was still totally worth the modest cost, though.	4.0	Best so far, though not as hi-def as one would like	2014-01-27	1	1	0

The length of the movie allows for wonderful character development.  The actors are not as overtly beautiful as the 2005 production, but seem more true to their characters.

The plot, the acting, the costumes, the perfect blend of satire and drama are enough to make a romantic of anyone. This is the movie that made and anglophile of me.The tale is a familiar one, the tempestuous romance between Miss Prejudice and Mr. Pride personified. Darcy and Elizabeth are a marvelous pair, likable but by no means perfect. The whole thing is handled with such taste and elegance that many modern movie makers should be ashamed of themselves by comparison.I cannot think of a single weak point in the movie except for this:It is addictive. I was sadly unable to watch the entire series in one gulp but I stayed up late many a night until I had watched every tape. The fourth one is the killer, it will literally mesmerize.In case you haven't noticed, i only liked this movie a little. ;-) Give yourself a treat and watch this smart, funny romance and fall in love with it yourself.	5.0	100% pure magic condensed for your enjoyment	2001-11-09	6	4	2
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3Q8R482QMWRXK	Amazon Customer	I borrowed the six VHS tapes of the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle from the library a while ago and loved it, thought it was the best move I'd ever seen, period. Annoyingly enough, the library only lets me borrow 3 tapes at a time, so I tried renting the Keira Knightley version a few times from a video store. I was disappointed in it the first time, since it just couldn't compare, it was so dreary and dark. I do like the first proposal from Darcy when he is close to kissing Elizabeth, even as he's been rejected and is obviously hurt.  After having watched it a few times I liked it well enough to buy it. Since then I have wanted to watch the better version and borrowed it again from the library but only could take 2 tapes....when I came back the next day they wouldn't let me take the last four, I had to choose three. That was it; I'd had it. How can they expect me to chop up a movie this engrossing  over three days??? I just bought the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle DVD version a couple days ago.I'll probably only watch the Keira Knightley version rarely, the other one is so much more bright and cheery and closer to the book. And having watched Colin Firth as Darcy first, to me he IS Darcy and is who I picture when reading the book.	5.0	Best version of the two I have seen	2006-11-27	5	5	0

The book had long been a favorite of mine, and while I waited impatiently for the rerelease on DVD during the summer of 2001, it was well worth the wait, price and anticipation.The first viewing was majestic, and I had never felt a movie had so closely replicated the book than when I first dedicated an entire weekend to viewing and reviewing the movie.Therefore, it was incredibly disappointing to discover on multiple viewings (upon reading the book again) that several of the characterizations fell short. In particular, Mary, Kitty and Lydia are whitewashed in the movie as ignorant girls rather than dynamic characters whose nuances and intricacies can intrigue viewers as well as annoy.Furthermore, and perhaps most disappointing of all, Elizabeth is characterized in perhaps a too modern, too feminist sense. While in the book Elizabeth displays feminist behaviors for the time, she is also acknowledged to get swept away in the frivilous behavior of her younger sisters by looking anxiously for the highly reputed Mr. Bingley, whereas in the movie, she couldn't care less about romance and the thrill of the pursuit. Her relationship with Charlotte is underplayed and with Jane overdrawn. Elizabeth is right too often, and humbled too seldom, resulting in a lowered enjoyment of the supplementary characters. Where in the book, Jane is charitable in her kind opinions of the Bingley sisters, in the movie she is blind to their faults while Elizabeth sees them straightaway. In the book, Darcy is the titular pride. In the movie, it is Elizabeth.The movie is beautiful and highly recommended; however, the carelessness with the nuances of characters' personality detracts upon closer scrutiny from the book to the film.	4.0	Stellar cast, faithful adaptation, something's missing	2002-08-21	16	11	5

I didn't see it on A&amp;E. After reading the reviews of this film on this site, I decided to take a gamble, and I bought it.  One of things I found  so neat about it, is they presented Mr. Darcy as human, not some  two-dimensional piece of wood, as I have seen in other versions.  It was  interesting to see him struggle with his feelings for Elizabeth.  Elizabeth  of course, was just as feisty and high spirited as ever.  What a wonderful  performance.  It was a very good adaptation of the book, and most of the  characters were real.  My only criticism is the choice of Susanna Harker as  Jane.  I saw her in Heat of the Sun, and she was wonderful, but I thought  her Jane Bennett was lacking. All in all, the movie was well-acted,  well-filmed and on the whole, a joy to watch, especially of course, the  relationship of Elizabeth and Darcy.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AH93HX89KVQG2	"Amy Green ""Amy Green"""	"I've lost count of how many times I've read Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen - it's one of my very favorite books. Comparing the two miniseries adaptations of it -- the more recent one by A&E;/BBC and the one done in the 80s by BBC (Pride and Prejudice (BBC, 1980)) -- there are definite advantages to each. The one you choose depends on what you want. If you want a really good and fun modern romantic comedy, watch the A&E; version. But if you want what is closest to Austen's novel (which I prefer), watch the older version. The first time I tried to watch the newer version, I turned it off after the first 30 minutes because I kept saying, ""THAT didn't happen in the book"" over and over again and it was really frustrating me. I finally forced myself to keep watching it with my mom there to be able to vent to as needed (she's also a huge fan of P&P; and of the Rintoul version), and got through it OK and then wrote this review afterwards.POSITIVES OF THE A&E; VERSION:1) It is a visual feast: The costumes, sets and scenery are exquisite and make this version worth watching for that reason alone. They obviously had a larger budget than the 80s version, which is done in the old BBC 'stage play' style.2) Since this version is 75 minutes longer than the BBC version, you get to enjoy that much more of Austen's incomparable dialogue - the best ever written in the English language besides Shakespeare, in my opinion!3) In the interplays between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, their emotions are much more pronounced and open than in the BBC version... which makes their relationship more openly romantic even than in the novel. This is developed further by some scenes of them individually that weren't in the novel. In the 80s version and the novel, many of the subtleties of their relationship and feelings are left to the imagination. The A&E; version is more in the unsubtle style of a typical modern romantic movie, which gives a wonderful new dimension to the story. The ""unexpected proposal"" scene is absolutely perfect; I think Austen would have loved it!4) Casting Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. Although not as strikingly handsome as David Rintoul's Darcy in the 80s version (in the book, Darcy is far handsomer than Bingley), Firth adds the right amount of visible emotion to the character which David R. did not, while also maintaining a very aristocratic, refined air about him.POSITIVES OF THE 80s BBC VERSION:1) It is much more faithful to the historical setting of the novel. It captures much more accurately the slow-moving, thoughtful, refined, restrained, purist, obsessed-with-manners (but still quite amusing) aristocratic society of 18th century England. This to me gives not only a needed believability to, but also a much deeper understanding of, the characters and story. Austen's novels were very realistic and true to their time and place, so if you want the genuine Austen feel rather than the 'in-your-face' Hollywood style, see the 80s version (or just stick to the book). The A&E; version comes across as being 20th century American, just cloaked in 18th century England costumes and sets. (For example, Bingley's two supposedly high class sisters slouch around, make faces and giggle audibly behind people's backs. Everyone seems to be constantly running, skipping or galloping somewhere. The less-than-savory characters, like Mary, Lydia, Kitty, and Mr. Wickham, look and act like they are from a much lower social class, in ways that go below what would have been acceptable in their class. A visitor to the Bennett home accidentally sees one of the sisters in her undergarments. When E. visits Pemberley, she sees Mr. D. coming from a dip in a pond with a wet undershirt on, rather than just having arrived in a carriage as in the book.) Some people have praised this aspect of it, saying that the BBC version is boring by comparison. But I believe that Austen's intent was that the interest in her novels would lie with her detailed character studies and intricate relational plots. That's what made her books so interesting, without all the action-packed gallivanting around and crassness which Hollywood seems to think is a necessity to entertainment. The BBC version recognizes this and retains a historical elegance and dignity; the A&E; version does not.2) The casting is better. In the BBC version, each actor is completely natural and believable in his or her role. In the A&E; version, much of the casting does not seem to fit the characters. Elizabeth comes across as being about twenty years older than she is, with a constantly knowing look as if she's already married with children. Mrs. Bennett seems too intelligent to be so silly. Charlotte seems snobby rather than humble. Miss Bingley seems cold and sharp rather than sweetly slimy. Mr. Collins is like a cartoon and not a believable person. The five Bennett sisters don't look at all like they could be related to each other. The actors seemed quite competent, just not cast in the right roles, and maybe directed to overplay them. The only one that was spot on was Colin Firth as Darcy. His was the only portrayal that I could totally believe to be a real person in 18th century England.3) The BBC version gives the same attention to each character that Austen's novel does. In the A&E; version, only the principal characters are focused on, with the result that many of the characters whom we should have gotten to know better seemed to just be cardboard props, and their relationships with each other don't come across as being as intimate and familiar as they really are in the novel. For example, Elizabeth had a much deeper relationship with both her father and with her Aunt Gardiner than the A&E; version portrayed, because it left out some key scenes between those characters. The only ones I could perceive as being really close in the A&E; version were Elizabeth and Jane - and in the last half, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. This is a great loss, because Austen's novels are all about the relationships between people, and each of their interesting personality quirks. They are character studies -- not just of the main characters, but of ALL the characters.Sorry for the length, but P&P; is a special book and I wanted to share my full views on these adaptations for anyone trying to decide between them!BUT AS ALWAYS, it's a good idea to 1) read the negative reviews as well as the positive, since they are wildly different from each other, and 2) RENT before you buy!"	4.0	Which adaptation is better?

About four years ago, I had to read Pride and Prejudice for a college class.  I must admit, I was not the most diligent student.  Fortunately, the professor showed this mini-series in class, one tape per class period, at the same time we were supposed to be reading it.  After watching the third or fourth tape in class, my younger sister (who was also in the class) and I decided that we couldn't wait for the next few classes to see the end, so we bought the whole set and watched the rest of it that same day.  Even more importantly, I loved the mini-series so much that I actually WANTED to read the book.This adaptation is a joy to watch, even after repeated viewings.  Whenever I start watching it, I can't stop until I've watched all six tapes, and I'm sad when it's over.  The settings are lush and beautiful; the costumes, fantastic; the music, gorgeous.  The script stays very close to the spirit of the book and retains much of Austen's original dialogue, and the dialogue that has been added for dramatic purposes fits right in with Austen's.  The direction breathes life into the words on the page.As for the acting, it was superb.  To me, Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth ARE Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, lifted right out of the pages of the book.  David Bamber is especially good as Mr. Collins (can you imagine anyone more obsequious?).  Notable performances are also given by Benjamin Whitrow as the eccentric and witty Mr. Bennet, Julia Sawalha as the very irresponsible Lydia, Susannah Harker as the good-hearted Jane, Crispin Bonham-Carter as the amiable Mr. Bingley, Anna Chancellor as the snobbish Miss Bingley, Barbara Leigh-Hunt as the &quot;condescending&quot; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and Alison Steadman as the obnoxious Mrs. Bennet.  Everyone did a wonderful job, from the smallest walk-on to the largest role!  Perhaps it's the effect of seeing the mini-series at the same time I first read the book, but I envision these actors in their respective roles whenever I read the book.  On second thought, I think this mini-series, and all the actors in it, are just THAT good!(On a side note:  some reviewers have called Alison Steadman's performance annoying and over-the-top.  I thought so, too, until I re-read the book and realized that she's supposed to be like that.  She constantly causes embarrassment to Jane and Elizabeth, and there's a reason why Mr. Bennet spends so much time in his library!  The end of the book mentions that Jane and Mr. Bingley remain at Netherfield only a year before they move away, stating that, &quot;So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart.&quot;)I recently watched the mini-series again, and I felt compelled to read the book all over again.  I enjoyed both experiences immensely.  The mini-series is a nice companion and lead-in to the book.  I was not used to the somewhat archaic language and wordy prose used in the book, but the mini-series eased me into it beautifully.  I was then able to enjoy the book that much more.I recommend that you watch this mini-series and then read the book to complete the experience.

It follows the book very well, unlike other cinematic adaptations of the novel.  Colin Firth plays a captivating Mr. Darcy, and Jennifer Elhe's Elizabeth Bennet is both charming and delightful. Julia Sawalha's portrayal of Lydia Bennet is hilarous and true to Austen's character. Benjamin Whithrow and Alison Steadmen give wonderful performances as Mr. and Mrs Bennet, and the rest of the cast should be commended as well.  I would recommend this movie to anyone. The cinematography and screenplay are excellent. My only objection to this DVD is that the credits are shown at the end of what would have been each episode in the mini series.

The actors were excellent.  The design was perfect, and fitted the whole production well.  It was entertaining, even to sit down and watch the whole thing at once.  And most important, it was true to both the substance and the spirit of Jane Austen's original novel.No adaptation of any kind will ever be completely faithful.  No matter how much effort is put into staying true to the original, some elements must be added or taken away to better suit the new medium.  The trick lies in doing so in a way that adds to, rather than detracts from, the original.  And boy, is this a great adaptation!	5.0	The Best-ever Adaptation	2002-02-15	3	1	2

I thought the video was quite like the book, almost word for word and the scenic countryside was mesmerizing.  The characters were true to the book.  Since Jane Austen doesn't allow her characters more than a look or a touch, it was, as usual, hard to wait to the end for the Lizzy and Darcy connection.  It would have been nice to see her hold his arm walking down the lane.  The video was well done and the characters did an excellent job.  I like the fact that more of Darcy was seen in this one.  An A+ rating, I received the video in less time than it was determined, and the price was wonderful. Thank you, thank you.	5.0	Pride and Prejudice fan	2010-02-15	1	1	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	ATWTBPVXV9GAS	"Anne Kazlauskas ""lenna"""	"I originally finished this review on 17 September 2004 (pre blu-ray) but hesitated to post because of its length.  I wrote as I did in enthusiasm for the production itself, in wishing to respond to some especially well-written reviews mentioned below & to some recurring themes that I found curious.  Since then I have kept up with the hundreds of posts, delighting in the dialogue that never wants to quit! Now newly encouraged to post by Mr. Richter's review of 8 December 2009 I see he has written in excellent detail on several of my themes.  I offer this as a complementary piece since I also expand on some of his.  Also since 2004, I was struck by several reviewers who so well stated what I was struggling to say regarding the beauty of the leading women - that they seem chosen to embody what was considered most beautiful in the demeanor, painting, sculpture & cameo art of Austen's period, not necessarily our own time (see Pyles - 1/9/06 & Damamirlo - 11/8/08). Thanks to all of you for your contributions.  Now - maybe better late than never - here is mine.First, I have watched only the old VHS set which despite some awkward, cut-off views, graininess & inconvenience I like very much for its warm colours.  I'll stick with it until there is something which recaptures those colours with better clarity & adds more gracious centering, richer sound.I have not yet read any commentary by people involved in the production other than a bit by Colin Firth on playing Mr. Darcy.I've watched this BBC/A&E; Pride & Prejudice multiple times after happening upon an episode on Scottish TV & have become as obsessed as many.  Quite a few reviews here have been enjoyable & helpful.  I'm now eager to see the earlier film versions to compare. Whatever their merits I am puzzled by those who do not think the people playing the lead couples for BBC/A&E; are beautiful enough or that the film follows both letter & spirit of Jane Austen.  Of course beauty is always a matter of taste but in the case of Elizabeth it seems clear from the book that hers, as one person put it, is the sort that grows on one.  When Darcy first begins to be attracted he debates with himself about certain imperfections in her form.  Even her ""fine eyes"" must have a controversial element that Miss Bingley may disparage them (in book & film) with more reason than simple jealousy.  As I got to know Ms. Ehle many of the glances of those eyes & her general wealth of expression brought me to tears.  Jane is radiant in her blond gentleness, also well showing her inner strength.  Bingley only appears vapidly handsome at times because he is a happy, uncomplicated person surrounded by much more conflicted souls who necessarily interest us more.Those who wish the writer hadn't left out Austen's scenes of Elizabeth with her mother & Darcy after her engagement have a good point.  I miss them too the more I think about it but as time was probably the issue I don't know what I would want left out.  This whole feeling of wanting is not inconsistent with Austen.  She almost always writes such lively detail into her characters & plots only to leave us suddenly hanging as she hurries through their marriages.  We are happy for our new friends & at once agonized to say good-bye.Thank you to the women from Inverness, Scotland (3/19/01) & Holland, MI (7/2/01).  You wrote so eloquently especially about your favourite Colin Firth scenes that I was inspired to write.  Austen writes so much from Elizabeth's perspective that for the sake of film we need these (sometimes ""extraneous"", imagined) Darcy scenes for balance, to help us understand his attraction & development.  That they work so naturally with Austen's plot & provide some of the most memorable scenes is a tribute to the writer & director's imaginations & Firth's prodigious talents.The ""look"" scene over the Pemberley fortepiano doesn't exist in Austen.  You may remember that there is a morning call among the women during which they try for polite conversation (led by Georgiana's companion & Mrs. Gardiner) & eat a lot of gorgeous fruit.  The men are out fishing & only Darcy comes in later causing more embarrassment for Elizabeth since everyone is suspicious.  Austen only describes this scene other than Miss Bingley's taunt (that doesn't mention Wickham's name).  She picks up the dialogue later with Miss Bingley's jabs at Darcy - leading to his annoyed but triumphant, ringing defense of Elizabeth's appearance.  Including the early part of this scene would have meant making up a lot of new dialogue - something I think they tried to avoid.The solution?  It seems to be a kind of soiree with everyone present where music is the principal language followed by the expressions of those listening.  This grows organically from Darcy's delight at Elizabeth's playing at Rosings (""No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you could find anything wanting..."").  He hears the inner spirit of herself & the music expressed in her performance, whatever her technical deficiencies, & naturally is longing to find a way to hear her again.  Even though WE only hear the end the choice is inspired.  (Check out a translation of Cherubino's Act II aria from Mozart's ""Marriage of Figaro"" if you are unfamiliar with it.)  His eyes melt in the warmth of his delight - not only in love of Elizabeth, of the music, of his sister, but in seeing them together absorbed by common interest.  Notice in the inn scene his manner of anxious eagerness that they ""hit it off"".  Notice how some added scenes show us how he cares for his sister, how Elizabeth's unaffected love for Jane draws him to her.  He loves Elizabeth for herself but also knows she is the best companion (with all the silly, vain women around them) to make Georgiana forget her shyness, her past injuries, & to coax her into the truly happy, accomplished woman he longs for her to be.I am nearly as moved by the little scene going to or from the nightly dog walk.  The relief of seeing the two women together gives spring to his step.  He fairly dances into the darkened room to relive his delight while the vision is still fresh - exactly what a lover would do.  Both these scenes are more poignant because his relief is not that of fulfillment but only of new hope born of the new warmth & understanding in Elizabeth's gaze.  He is too humbled to be sure of her now when in fact she does not yet understand her own feelings.So what of the fencing & swimming scenes?  I don't claim to know whether it would be ""natural"" for a man of his rank (or any) to attend a public class or to jump in a murky frog pond (clearly not the lake or river as some have written) at that time.  Maybe these imaginings ARE too modern.  Of course they show him wrestling with his emotions & the famous leap forms the culmination of a little thread of Darcy shown cooling his heated passions.  But also one might notice that he is submitting himself to the scrutiny of his peers - & possibly ""inferiors"" -  when he would have had every right to a private fencing master.  The original plan was to film the swimming scene in the nude (see Firth's 2001 ""Fresh Air"" interview on US public radio) which Firth felt would have been more natural in a place where he expected no scrutiny at all.  I'm not sure.  The man has just ridden perhaps thirty miles or more on a hot August day.  He sits down, considers a bit, pulls off the more encumbering items & impatiently jumps in, perhaps looking forward to walking back with the breeze on his wet clothes.I think all these scenes help show us Darcy as a shy, natural, honest, free-spirited man behind all his aristocratic upbringing.  We can understand better here than from the book why Elizabeth appeals to him so much as a kindred spirit.  Thanks to the intelligence of Davies, Langton & Firth these new thoughts add richly to my love of Austen's work.  Just more persuasion for a few nay-sayers that the whole team did something very special.Finally, a bit more about music.  I'm delighted with the period detail.  Notice the musician playing bass on the wood & leather serpent at the Netherfield ball, the best European masters sought earnestly by Mary & Georgiana, the empty brilliance of Mrs. Hurst's Mozart, the easy familiarity with country dances.  Even giddy Lydia not only cherishes her steps but the names of her favourite tunes - for all that ""every savage can dance"", you know.  Carl Davis' score fascinates me.  I'm sure there are allusions I'm not getting since I do hear a few.  Are there little anachronistic hints of Wagner when Darcy is shown with a particularly gloomy Byronic or even early Wagnerian air?  At his most agitated he reminds me more of Goethe's Werther.  Is it just an inside joke since Wagner was born the same year as the book appeared?  If so, it makes me smile at rather the wrong places.  But as the Darcy/Elizabeth struggle intensifies does anyone else hear echoes of Schubert's C major quintet?  All I need is this reminder of the great, throbbing, longing Adagio to bring tears.  The restless major-minor shifting is so perfect for them even though it's later than 1813 also.  Endless riches of association."	5.0	Rare, special team work, endless riches	2010-04-08	4	3	1

The stars Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are perfectly cast but so are all the secondary roles.  The interaction between Mr. and Mrs. Bennett is portrayed with perfect  comic timing as is the role of the nerdy cousin, Mr. Collins.  If you can  take your eyes off the beautiful scenery, listen to the music as well.  The  leit-motifs for each character is distinctive and beautifully orchestrated.  Like &quot;Star Wars&quot;, you can tell which character is coming simply  by listening to the music.  My husband and I have watched this movie  several times.  Our two eldest daughters, a gifted seventh and gifted sixth  grader,  also enjoyed the movie very much and consider it one of their  favorites. I have recommended this movie more than any other.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2V7HP8G39HKRV	Anonymous	This version succeeds despite a few problems, such as Mrs. Bennet's shrill voice which I don't recommend when you have a headache or are stressed. She is a little over the top for me, though if there were less of her voice, it would be okay. I always either turn down or mute those parts or fast forward through them now. Other versions have a far more pleasing interpretation of Mrs. Bennet while still conveying her character as Austen wrote it. The dramatic change from one Darcy to another is a little hard to believe. One wonders how his change, which seems so sincere, could have been so dramatic. However, the changed Darcy here is utterly charming and I am always willing to suspend disbelief and enjoy it. This should be in your collection.	4.0	4+ Still the best adaptation out there	2006-08-24	7	6	1

Colin Firth transcends his age disadvantage and gives a performance which will forever define his career, he has been typecasted as Mr Darcy forever and ever. You can feel his angst in every scene leading to the first proposal.The love-hate relationship you feel for the other antagonists is only heightened by their superb performance. Even the nose of Lady Catherine de bourgh was condescending.After watching Julia Sawalha on Absolutely fabulous for many years, I was astonished by her giggly, childish performance as Lydia.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2U549OUP6XJ1B	"April79marie ""April79marie"""	"I am well aware that this film is still a favourite for many Jane Austen's fans. So I won't be too harsh with this review. This BBC Pride and Prejudice is undoubtedly the best adaptation of the book. The most important passages of the novel are there and Jane Austen's witty dialogues haven't practically been altered. Even the characters correspond to the original story and we can give credit to the actors who make them so alive. Mrs Bennet is desperately annoying thanks to Allison Steadman who makes her as whiny and as bad-tempered as possible. Mr Collins is so unappealing and so silly that it is no wonder that Lizzie Bennet does her best to avoid him. Colin Firth plays a dashing Darcy without a fault. He is so rude and so conceited that I feel the urge to slap him especially when he cruelly says to his friends about Elizabeth Bennet ""she a beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit"". Thank God, his attitude changes a little for the better afterwards. I also love Anna Chancellor in the part of Miss Caroline Bingley. She is so deliciously mean that I can't resist laughing at the expense of the heroine. She always manages to put on her face all the hypocrisy of the character and the dislike that she feels for Elizabeth Bennet.So yes, this film is BBC at its best. It is very well shot. You can see that the cast and the crew put all their energy into making this film. The setting is perfect (what horrible wallpapers though!!!), the costumes are great and you can at leisure see the actors eating, dancing, walking in the countryside, and riding horses. It is also perfect for the students or school teenagers who have to study the book but wish to avoid reading it. For, in five hours (at least), the film can give them a detailed insight of the novel. Some of my friends didn't particularly like the book but since they saw this version on my DVD, they have changed their mind about the book. (can't tell you how happy I was, since I love the book so much).That being said, I consider that there are still some flaws in it. For example, I don't understand why Ehle is running in the park the morning after Darcy's proposal, as if nothing between them had happened.  Her reaction to his words of love comes a little late for me. If I remember well, Lizzie is pretty shaken by that proposal in the book. Another problem concerns the cast. The features of Suzanna Harker who is supposed to play the beautiful Jane (R.Pike fit better the part) are not really remarkable. I am not saying that the actress is not pretty but that she sometimes seems a bit `dull' compared to Jennifer Ehle whose looks are more stunning. The actress in the part of Charlotte Lucas is not plain enough as well but the mistake in the casting is especially obvious with the red-haired actress who is supposed to play the plain Miss King and each time I hear Maria Lucas say about her ""She is not very pretty, isn't she?"", my first reaction is ""What??? Not pretty? She is absolutely gorgeous!""But then, I am not drawn to this version the way I am to the 2005 movie with Keira Knightley and MacFadyen although I still enjoy watching it very much. The problem is that Andrew Davies recreated the scenes almost exactly as they are in the book (there are only one or two exceptions, the most popular one being the scene with Darcy diving into the lake and appearing dishevelled and wet in front of Lizzie which is a gorgeous scene, I grant you!) and so the BBC version is a bit too classical. It sometimes lacks in intense, emotional moments and in spontaneity. Maybe I am too romantic but I was much more thrilled by the passionate, near-kissing and under-the rain- proposal scene with Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen, although the dialogues had been changed, than by Firth and Ehle's classic, indoor scene. One scene that I enjoy tremendously in the 2005 version is when Rosamund Pike/ Jane tearfully say `Yes, a thousand times yes!' to Simon Woods. Why is that? Because the actress manages to show exactly what it must be like for a young woman of that period to get at last a proposal from the man she loves, because the scene reflects the beauty of first love. When Colin Firth/Darcy renews his feelings to Lizzie, I am always a bit frustrated ( though I know it is like that in the book) because there is not the joyful reaction that I expected on Firth/Darcy's face when Lizzie tells him about her new feelings. That is why I prefer the 2005 movie's climactic scene with a dishevelled MacFadyen claiming once more his love for Lizzie at dawn and a K. Knightley who can't stand still afterwards, impatient as she is, to get her father's consent!What I mean to say is that I love both version but not for the same reasons because after all they are very different. And I would definitely advise this BBC version to those who are already great fans of the book. It has really great moments and Ehle and Firth do have chemistry. Maybe they could have shown it more often but that is my opinion. Just like for 'North and South', you don't notice time flying by although it is 5 hours long..."	4.0	It is a funny and perfect adaptation but could have been more romantic	2006-09-25	18	9	9

For me, the greatest episode is the fourth one when Lizzy begins to realise that the pomposity of the outer DArcy does not convey the immense graciousness of the man. To see how love changes Darcy (i.e. overcoming the real pompositiy and pride) - he becomes humble, he melts before our eyes and his real greatness comes to the fore - all because of the extraordinary power of love to make the lover and loved one shine,sparkle and grow. This is a trully glorious production conveying, as all classics do, some of the great truths about human life. And then, of course, the sycophantic vicar: he too is wonderful but in a completely differnt way. Bravo!!!	5.0	Infectiously joyful: tears of joy!,	2009-12-01	3	3	0

The acting, the music, the scenery...everything is fantastic.Pride and Prejudice is funny, romantic, entertaining..it's focus is the upper-upper class of England in the early 1800s...people who are so wealthy that no one needs to work and they can focus entirely on leisure and courtship.The matriarch of the Bennett family is set on getting all of her daughters married off and this story revolves mainly around her two eldest daughters, and their relationships with Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy. The story also covers the lives of the two youngest, and silliest, Bennett girls and the extremely serious Mary Bennett. Of course, the ultimate plot line is the love-hate relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy.I am normally not interested in period pieces and turned this movie down at first. I'm very glad I gave it a chance because it tops the list of favorites now.	5.0	Very good	2006-09-24	3	3	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3OR9X4XEUJ32I	A Satisfied Viewer	This BBC/A&E; production is the finest adaptation that I have ever seen of a Jane Austen novel. It is simply magnificent- from its capturing of Austen's razor-sharp wit, to the beautiful cinematography and engaging music, to the fast-moving plot that sweeps its audience in and won't let us go. My first viewing of this miniseries was back during its initial American broadcast on A&E; in about '96. That was my introduction to the magical world of Jane Austen (in my early teens), and it was because of this series that I was inspired to read the novel itself for the first time, as well as to discover other Austen books/film adaptations.The casting was one of its greatest strengths. Jennifer Ehle, as Elizabeth, was lovely and had just the right humor and charisma to carry the film on her shoulders. Colin Firth was outstanding as Mr. Darcy; the incredible depth of emotion he brought to his performance(held just under the surface by Darcy's reserved exterior) was a huge part of my being so deeply moved, romantically, by this film. (I fall in love with Mr. Darcy every time I watch it, and I'm really NOT one of those girls who tends to swoon over romantic movies. I certainly do in this case!) The entire cast was excellent.It seems that when films are adapted from novels, they're often able to do one of two things well: they either capture the spirit of the book to make for a good movie (while unfortunately leaving out or changing many of the details of the book), OR they follow the book very closely, but as a result come across as somewhat stiff and dull on screen. This film is so brilliant because it manages to achieve both ideals: It is painstakingly faithful to the novel (almost word-for-word in most scenes), while also being as fast-paced and full-of-life as any feature film could ever be. I'm so happy that the creative team allotted nearly 6 hours to tell the whole story, so that it would never feel rushed. It may, in fact, be the most faithful adaptation I've ever seen in capturing the plot, dialogue, and spirit, of any novel.	5.0	My Favorite of All Jane Austen Adaptations!	2008-04-10	3	3	0

Granted Sir Lawrence is pretty to look at and believe me I adore older movies, but the ending is typical of what Hollywood did back then which is such a crime.  Just trust me in knowing that Lady Catherine de Bourgh's reaction is not exactly the same in that film version.A&E; did as it always does when it brings classical literary works to the small screen, which is being true to the author's works and not try to appeal to the masses by giving it an ending that studio heads like better.The cinematography is pretty and the acting is wonderfully in sync with Jane Austen's writing.  It's hard picturing Darcy and Elizabeth any other way than the way Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle brought them to life.  Mr. Bennet portrayed by Benjamin Whitrow is a riot when reacting to his youngest daughters and his wife's antics.  It's just a joy to behold from beginning to end.  You won't be sorry if you purchase this DVD.	5.0	A Pride and Prejudice to be proud to own	2005-07-08	4	4	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	ACNXEF6K4MCFS	"A. Spicer ""N Spicer"""	I'm not very easily  satisfied by book-to-movie adaptions, especially when your dealing with classics like Austen, or Shakespeare. But having said that, this was a production which left me wishing it was longer (than 6hrs!)This is about as true to the book as youll ever see, it manages to be dramatic and yet retain the wonderful comedic sections, such as Mr Bennets dry wit. Some of the wonderful banter between Darcy and Elizabeth was omitted but not enough to make a huge difference.The Characters in this are perfectly cast, from the greasy, perpetually sweaty Mr Collins, to the overbearing Lady Catherine de Bourgh. You could not have pictured a more  engaging, enchanting Elizabeth. As in the book; she is not the most beautiful woman in the world yet there is truly something amazing about her, she mesmerises you completely, theres no escaping. Darcy is wonderful, if you hear or read Colin Firth talking about  Darcy, you see his portrayal in a new light, and from his first scene you understand him perfectly and almost sympathise with him, when you know he is saying some truly awful things.My real grade for this pic would have been 4.5, only losing the 1/2 because of the way everything finishes so abruptly. Almost 6 hours are spent going through chapter by chapter, word for word(almost), and then suddenly *bang*, its finished. Some of the best scenes between Darcy and Lizzy come at the end, when he accounts for having fallen in love with her. I know thats probably nitpicking but just the same...In conclusion, this film does what so many other films never think of, instead of adding pointless and superfluous dialugue to express feelings you read about in the book, they manage to do it with looks, meaningful glances, brilliant background music; and if what they say is true-a picture tells a thousand words, then each glance between Firth(darcy) and Ehle(Elizabeth) is worth a full length novel of its own.	5.0	Jane Austen the way it should be...	2001-05-07	4	4	0

It gets it right in all areas--a great screenplay adaptation, great acting, beautiful settings.  It is a perfect display of Jane Austen's wonderful characteriazations and tremendous wit.  All of the acting is wonderful, but the two leads stand out.  Colin Firth is an amazingly talented actor who is able to convey the repressed feelings of Darcy through his expressive eyes.  It is a performance that is the perfect example of acting without words.  And Jennifer Ehle is the perfect Lizzy--luminous and lively.  Their scenes together sparkle.  I also loved the scenes between Jane and Lizzy, showing genuine sisterly affection and 19th century girltalk. I can, and have, watched this movie over and over again.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AFSMGASIANB67	"A Williams ""honestpuck"""	This is a superb production. Colin Firth as Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth round out a marvellous  cast. Alison Steadman is a superb Mrs Bennet, shallow and witless; Benjamin Whitrow an excellent beleagured Mr Bennet and Crispin Bonham-Carter and Susannah Harker do a fine job as the lovers Mr Bingley and Jane Bennet.The production is well shot with beautiful location work and the adaptation, while it does tinker with some of the dialogue, benefits from the extended length of a miniseries over a movie. The BBC does this sort of adaptation so well with great locations, good writing and directing and a supporting cast that do a great job all the way down the cast list to Darcy's housekeeper. I particularly thought the Regency costumes in this production were marvellous, keep an eye out for the differences in dress between the rural Bennet girls and Mr Bingley's sisters.I won't waste space going over how marvellous Jane Austen's story is, how witty and sharp her look at the life of the rural gentry.The one problem you will have with this production is that once you sit down to watch it is impossible to stop and most of a day disappears as you are trapped in Jane Austen's world.	5.0	A truth universally acknowledged - a triumphant production	2002-03-07	5	4	1

Woodley ""Patroness, Janeites, the Austen list"""	I can't help myself - I just love this version of Pride and Prejudice. It has stunningly beautiful sets and scenes, it just seems to glow with vitality and vigour.I love most of the actors in their character parts - Mrs Bennet and Mr Collins are just stand-outs with Lady Catherine de Bourgh taking honours also. I was disappointed in Wickham though, he is supposed to be so charming - like all good con-men are, and yet I found him unattractive and rather sly looking. Jennifer Ehle seems to enjoy herself as Lizzie and while I felt that Colin Firth was a bit more Heathcliff than Mr Darcy at times - I found I didn't mind at all.The music in this movie adaptation is also beautiful - and if you are interested there is a great book which has been published about the making of this movie - you can look up the locations, the music and find out all the background on it generally.There have been some changes to Austen's words and scenes - most noticeably good old Darcy's infamous dive in the lake - but I didn't find at all off-putting. It has a good flow and the interference in the story is minimal. This version does run for some 6 hours (it was telly series) - so it isn't something you can necessarily expect to be able to sit in front of and watch non-stop. I guess it depends on your family though.	5.0	Great adpatation.....	2000-12-14	3	2	1

Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle are wonderful as Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. Also especially noteworthy are Julia Sawalha as Lydia (she is awesome!), Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Lady Catherine de Bourghe, and Anna Chancellor as Caroline Bingley (Mr. Bingley's sister).  She is a formidable presence and does a great job! One of the funniest sequences in this production is a silent scene (played under a voice-over) in which Darcy and both of Bingley's intimidating sisters are talking sternly to Bingley and we see them from Mr. Bingley's POV (they were looking down at the camera). You might have to see the scene to understand what I mean, but trust me, it's fantastic - just like the rest of the production. :)	5.0	Definitely worth buying!	2003-02-08	1	1	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2PN65B6BSTIYZ	B. A. Chaney	"This review is of the Blu-ray version of this classic film.  If you're reading this, you probably already love this adaption, but might be wondering why Blu-ray.  Here's my answer:I've been a fan of the BBC's 1995 version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" for at least 10 years now, and have owned the mini-series on both VHS tape and DVD.  When I saw that a Blu-ray version of the film was being released, my first thought was why would I want this film, which has always looked like poor quality TV at best, or downright grainy at worst, on Blu-ray, which you buy for films with a high level of visual detail?  But then I started researching what had gone into the production of the Blu-ray disc, including a full restoration of the film and a new transfer from the 16mm film.  I looked at stills online which showed the difference between the DVD and Blu-ray versions--generally a clearer picture and brighter colors--and I was convinced that it would be worth trying this version.After watching the entire miniseries on Blu-ray, I am shocked at how good this film looks after the restoration.  It's no longer the grainy, dull colors production that you're used to seeing.  My husband walked in while I was watching it, and thought that this must actually be a new production because it looked so crisp.  This is hands down the BEST presentation of this classic I have ever seen, so if you're a fan and you have access to a Blu-ray player, do yourself a favor and upgrade.  It's totally worth it to see the film as it was originally intended to look--making a great movie absolutely gorgeous."	5.0	You Won't Believe How Great the Blu-ray Version of this Classic Looks!	2009-04-24	17	17	0

Wonderful cast, superb acting and beautiful costumes.  I am running out of superlatives which is a shame because I cannot praise this production enough.I did have a problem though,  I have my own copy of this film and decided that my daughter would really enjoy it so bought it for her birthday.  Unfortunately, Amazon, in their wisdom,  decided that my son may like it too and so sent one to him as well, at my cost and not on my instruction.  No problem I thought I will just email and tell them of their error.  HOURS LATER I REALISED THAT YOU SIMPLY CANNOT CONTACT AMAZON.  My son no longer lives at the address they used so God knows who has the video I paid for.  It makes me feel very nervous about using Amazon again.

A P&amp;P fan will recognize the novel from the first images.  The script follows the novel better than any video adaptation of any Austen I've seen, ever.The screenwriter takes a few tiny liberties with Darcy's decorum for the sake of demonstrating that he is a passionate man under the cool reserve, but the swim and fencing scenes work so well I forgave them immediately.The caste, wardrobe, sets, and script are all brilliant.  Devices to condense the novel into only(!) 300 minutes are nearly seamless.  I can't believe they developed the complex characters so thoroughly so quickly.The ONLY weak point is that the DVD special features are a little lacking--biography of Austen is the usual blurb, there aren't many caste interviews or bios, and the background is sketchy.I quite enjoyed the screenwriter interviews, and the picture quality is enough of an improvement to make the DVD worth buying over the VHS if you have the option.  The VHS, however, will let you start and stop more precisely as you watch over several days.	5.0	Perfect adaptation!	2003-11-07	1	1	0

Lifton	The producer and director set out to recreate Jane Austin's world and her people, and they succeeded.  The loving detail of place, form, color, music, dance and acting in this glorious production brilliantly projects the viewer into the early 19th Century world of the landed gentry - a dreamland of beauty and wit.The acting, (with the unfortunate exception of Allison Steadman as Mrs. Bennett who overacts shamelessly, and sounds like a rusty saw scraping on metal), is so superior to anything an American could see on television, that it is like entering a new plane of existence.  Best are Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, although the actors who played Ms. Lucas and Mr. Bingly were also terrific.Great extra features, too, although I would have LOVED an interview with Colin Firth, who is to die for!If you haven't seen it, you are a deprived person!	5.0	Loving recreation of Jane Austin's masterpiece	2006-06-05	10	8	2

You guessed it; Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors and Pride and Prejudice is my favorite of her novels.  Viewing this dramatization on the two disks takes about five and one half hours which is too short a time.  I was very upset when it ended, and I recommend watching the whole thing in one sitting if possible.Reading the noverl is preferable to watching any of the movie versions, however if you cannot read for any number of reasons this is the best adaptation available.  It is broken into five segments and split over two disks, but it is still worth the time to see it.Have you been turned off by many of the so-called period pieces?  My sympathies to you.  Do not, for your own sake, be turned off by this in considering this adaptation.  I find it as close as possible to the written word and well acted and photographed. A friend says she will watch anything with Colin Firth.  Whatever your reason for watching this watch it and enjoy it and keep it close to rewatch.	5.0	Too Short	2013-06-12	2	2	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3EUSH8DPW75LR	barry	This 1995 A&E;/BBC version of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is considered a classic and surprisingly I had never seen it.  And I am a huge fan of BBC dramas from that era.  This version is 6 hours.  Back then they always did shows in longer versions where they could really show a story to its full effect.  These days they are often done in short 2 hour versions where much of the true subtleties in the story are totally lost.  I am a huge Colin Firth fan and wanted all his work on blu ray so of course PRIDE AND PREJUDICE popped up.  Not only is this an excellent mini-series but it is the defining role that made Colin Firth a true star.  He embodies the character of Darcy so fully and expertly that no other actor could come close.  And Jennifer Ehle also shines as the spirited and independent Elizabeth Bennet.  Career making performance for her as well.  The entire production is top notch from scenery, costume, script, directing and most of all acting.  All characters are cast perfectly.  The story comes across as a superb period piece and a love story for all times.I also learned that since its airing all dvd versions had terrible video and ruined the viewing experience.  Much expectation was put on this blu ray transfer.  I am seeing it fresh and not comparing it to the dvd and must say the blu ray is a true vision.  It is a truly lush viewing experience.  The video is crisp with strong clarity.  Detail in scenery, costume and facial close-ups is superb.  Colors pop and flesh tones are very realistic.  You can see each line on the faces and each blade of grass.  Black/white ratio is excellent as well.  I found this blu ray transfer to be truly lovely and an excellent vehicle with which to view such an amazing story.  The audio here though only PCM 2.0 stereo is still remarkably strong.  The dialogue and beautiful orchestration both are strong and present.  This is honestly a superb viewing experience all around.  There is also a detailed bonus documentary on how they made this glorious restoration.  If you are a fan of this story, the stars involved, period pieces or truly magical love stories this blu ray comes highly recommended.	5.0	Review of the blu ray transfer	2011-09-18	7	7	0

I, too, have watched my VHS version many times.  I had excitedly expected the DVD to be better in both sound and video quality, but, alas, it is sadly worse.  I had to fiddle with the brightness and color controls on my TV to even get a passable color rendition.  How, how, did this travesty get released?  I feel so stung by this experience that I think a &quot;technical quality&quot; rating of sound and video should be part of any DVD review, particularly transcriptions from VHS.  It makes me leery about buying DVD versions of other old VHS favorites without renting them first or otherwise obtaining a preview of the DVD quality.	2.0	A sad transcription of a great performance	2003-07-15	6	4	2
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3I0D9ZPEJ9JX4	"BAW ""BAW"""	"The only other version that I saw was the Olivier/Garson version, which was (even by 1930s standards!) was pretty bad.  Garson & Olivier were both great actors, but even they could only do so much with the poor script and inept direction.I loved this one.  I especially liked the music.  They used period pieces and (thank you!) period instruments, for the most part; when they put in original music, they made it 'in style.'  The main theme, for example, could easily pass as part of a Beethoven piano concerto.Some people object to some of the actors being too old for the roles they played; that objection does not take into account the fact that people didn't live as long then as they do now.  A man of 28 was practically middle-aged; Darcy is a confirmed bachelor who finally gets netted.  No modern twentysomething could pull that off.  Similarly for the women.  With lifespans so short and childbirth so dangerous (not to mention such a high infant mortality rate) the only way to assure that there would be a next generation would be to have girls start to have babies as soon as they were capable of doing so, and to have as many as they could.  Hence, a single woman in her early twenties was considered an old maid; a modern girl couldn't pull that off.  They had to cast actors older than their characters.There was in the early to mid 1990s a great spate of Jane Austen adaptations (and, if you count ""Clueless"", updatings.)  I can't claim to have seen all of them, but this is the best so far."	4.0	Wonderful	2004-10-05	8	7	1

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AK7CA2P7VR9DV	Beading by the Lake	I imagine most purchasers of this dvd collection have already seen this version, and love it.  The 120-page companion book is fun to read, and has lots of details and pictures.My only complaint is the way the dvds themselves are held into their book.  The discs are each slipped halfway down their thin paperboard sleeves, and attached by a foam-type center knob to the insides of the dvd folder.  It is difficult to pry the discs off the rubber knob and at the same time be careful not to rip the sides of the thin paperboard sleeves.  The discs really are a pain to get out.  They are easy enough to get back in, but then you are unlikely to rip the sides putting them in like you are in the removal.	5.0	What's not to love?	2009-02-09	3	1	2
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3F7F7QKQP2FKT	Beanie	This is the best adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice ever! Did I mention Colin Firth? Don't need to say more than that! But seriously, it is truly excellent, and if you haven't seen it, you should see this version. When PBS recently featured Jane Austen on Maserpiece Classics, they used A & E's version (this one). That has to say something.	5.0	GREAT	2012-11-26	2	1	1
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A37HOT5IHY5JOL	Becca Bee	"I was finally able to watch this miniseries the whole way through, after 16 years, only because of my newfound appreciation of Colin Firth (The King's Speech made me a huge fan.)  I have to agree with most of the other reviews that much of this production is wonderful.  Jennifer Ehle is an intelligent, spirited Jane, and Firth brings great depth to the character of Darcy.  I also loved Mr. and Mrs. Bennet.  However, I disagree with those who would describe it as ""perfect.""My major criticism is the casting of Jane Bennet.  This character is supposed to be ten times lovelier than anyone else in the neighborhood, with a personality that makes you love her.  Instead, we have a plain Jane at best whose personality is bland and insipid.  For years, I found this version of Jane absolutely unbearable.  I started watching the miniseries two or three times, only to return to the 1980 version, with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul.  (More recently I fell in love with the 2005 Keira Knightley, Matthew Macfadyen movie.)My other criticisms are more minor.  I thought the flashbacks, when Lizzy and Darcy remember important moments together, were very clumsily done.  I found the music to be often annoying.  And finally, I do prefer to learn about Darcy's involvement in Lydia's wedding only when Elizabeth does.  I didn't think the scenes of Darcy skulking around the pits of London added to my understanding of his character, and it was definitely not the tone that Jane Austen used."	3.0	wonderful production marred by fatal flaw	2011-06-14	3	2	1

While the restoration is quite nice, I hate that it plays the opening and end credits between episodes.  I know this was originally released as a mini-series, but my original DVD version played each episode back to back without interruption.  It allowed me to really get into it like a movie.

"This is a superb adaptation of one of my favorite novels of all time.  The acting is fantastic, the scenery is gorgeous, the costumes are wonderful.  Each character is brought out supremely well by the perfectly-chosen actors who portray them.  Colin Firth...what can I say?  If I believed in reincarnation I would say that he is the very man Austen knew and portrayed in her novel.  Jennifer Ehle is excellent as Lizzie, and is as beautiful as the novel says she is supposed to be.  I don't know the actor who plays Mr. Collins' name, but he does it exceptionally well.  Well done are also the witty Mr. Bennet, the annoying Mrs. Bennett, the calm and sensible Jane, the inane younger sisterc, as, the affable aunt and uncle and the snake Mr. Wickham. Six hours may seem like a long time for a movie, but it goes by very fast, and your eyes are riveted to the screen every moment.  ( i only wish I had a 65"" screen every time Colin Firth is on! too bad he's married...)  :) Absolutely fantastic and a wonderful addition to any DVD collection."	5.0	six stars plus	2005-07-11	1	1	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2I5Y1XJS836YY	Becky Grace	I was AMAZED at the quality of this film when I first watched it. I am  usually very critical of movies taken from books, and  most often refuse to  see a movie that was originally a book, especially a book I admired  greatly. For the most part, I believe I am justified in this, having been  disappointed MANY times over changes, etc., that producers and  scriptwriters make. Having read P&amp;P and loved it immensely, I nearly  rejected the idea of seeing a movie version, not expecting what I call no  less than a miracle! Often I find that it is difficult enough making a good  movie out of a marginal book, but it is nearly impossible to achieve a true  classic both times! The book is most definitely a classic, and the movie  (much to my surprise!) lived up to its predecessor! Even if you are usually  disappointed over movie versions, I can assure you, this will not let you  down! The producers must be MASTERS to have achieved this. Simply, amazing.	5.0	A movie?

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3CCQ0PUQRLPFZ	Becky	I notice that some reviews refer to the DVD while others to the Blu-ray.  I already owned the Restored Edition DVD, and while it was much much better than the original, I have to say the Blu-ray is amazing!When I first started watching, I thought it was too grainy.  There are some scenes that appear a little too sharp in Blu-ray, especially the sky.  I'm guessing they sharpened the image to bring out detail in some scenes.  However, when compared side by side with the DVD, there is no comparison.  I have seen this movie more times than I can count, but it was like watching for the first time!  The colors are so much brighter, first of all.  In scenes where I had previously thought the characters were wearing very similar dresses, I realized they were different colors.  Also, the textures and patterns can be seen that were previously not visible.  I can hear the clocks chiming in the background that couldn't be heard with the original version (I first heard them in the Restored Version DVD).If you are trying to decide whether to upgrade to the Blu-ray, I would highly recommend it!	5.0	Blu-ray versus Restored Edition DVD	2012-01-20	11	11	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1EWHBQ76EXPPB	"Benjolina ""Benjolina"""	I am a little bit disappointed they omitted several tiny but important details in the original book. It should have been put into the screenwriting.1. In her first evening at Netherfield, Caroline Bingley was trying to get the attention of Darcy, to no avail. She finally asked Elizabeth to walk around the room, which prompted Darcy to unconsciously close the book he was reading, and looked up. This small detail is not in the movie.2. During her visit to Pemberley, it is not shown in the movie that Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner was shocked that Darcy gave so much attention to Elizabeth. They knew Elizabeth hated Darcy and they were told how evil he is, yet they are not surprised or suspicious enough that Darcy is so kind, gracious, and pay so much attention to her.I know this scene is very different from the book, because in the book it is what I will say a little bit unnatural. How can Elizabeth still managed to walk around the garden for a long time when Darcy suddenly appeared, is so unnatural. The movie version is much better and closer to real life.3. In the movie, it is very disappointing they ignore how Elizabeth informed her mother about Darcy's proposal. In the book it was outlined in great detail, I mean it's very long and special. Yet, in the movie suddenly after Elizabeth being questioned by her father about Darcy's proposal, we were given the scene at the wedding. And they show us the face of her mother, cold, unhappy (it looks like that to me). WWhat was her reaction? Did she realize that Darcy spent a fortune for her family without anyone knowing? That he was the one saving Lydia? All these details are ignored in the movie. Too bad.4. Casting is difficult, and critical too. Although in general I am very happy with the choice of the actors, I am disappointed with Mr. Wickham. He was supposed to be 28 years old, but in the movie he looks like 40 to me, and not handsome enough. In the book, Wickham is more handsome than Darcy.Even Colin Firth, playing Darcy, during shooting he was already 35, a little too old for a 28 years old. As for their acting, I cannot say anything but SUPERB. I love this movie.	1.0	Review by Ben	2004-05-02	41	14	27

It is true to the story, the actors are fantastic, the sets and costumes seem to be more authentic than other P&P; renditions. THough it is a long haul (6 hours), it's a retelling of a long book, so it does a good, relatively thorough job. One can understand the motivations of the characters and the plot points much better than in other versions, which are so compressed for time.At the same time, it manages not to be stuffy, but to carry over the humor inherent in this classic tale. It is one of the main reasons I picked up a Jane Austen book (I never read Austen in school, and nothing had drawn me to her before).

Although I found the palette of ochres and browns a bit dreary, it's otherwise a lively, charming, and truly romantic version of what is usually described as a &#34;comedy of manners&#34;.  It's so much more than that, for Austen's genius was in showing human interactions through how they related to personal expectations as well as mere social conventions.  What works especially well here is how you view Darcy through Elizabeth's eyes and how her opinion of him evolves.  One of the most beautiful, romantic, and almost erotic scenes ever is the look they exchange when she covers for the startled Georgiana at the piano when Miss Bingley makes an ignorant jibe at Elizabeth, unknowingly injuring Georgiana.  It would be lost on lesser actors, but Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth do wonders in that little moment.	5.0	Intelligent Romance	2012-12-20	0	0	0

I can watch this movie and read the book over and over and still see/read something that I had missed the previous time. This is a classic in the first sense.	5.0	Wonderful	2011-06-01	1	0	1

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	ARJOHRBC3SDA5	Blue Eagle	It's all very well for reviewers to rave about Colin Firth's brooding Darcy.  He does well enough, given that he has no-one to play against.  The smirking, complacent Jennifer Ehle is so badly miscast as Elizabeth that the entire production is undermined.  The shrill overacting of Alison Steadman and the (again) miscasting of Jane do not help.  The book is far more subtle, with nuances completely ignored by the scriptwriter who prefer to have Elizabeth constantly striking pert poses as a substitute for the actress having to display any emotion.  This is like watching Gone With The Wind without Vivien Leigh.  If the two leads are mismatched the entire point is lost, no matter how elaborate the production values.	2.0	Brooding on P&P	2005-02-23	33	9	24
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3QX3FLK1Z91JA	"""bluefreeskies"""	Pride and Prejudice is the best miniseries that's been ever made on tv! The cast is amazing, they give their best performance and the movie is very faithful to the book. Very faithful, I would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys watching period films or anyone that's into Jane Austen films.This is a great movie, very little to object to i.e. some cleavage is shown, lydia and wickham live together a few days before they decided to get married. That's very minor and the positive outshadows the negative, so its appropriate for families. I would definately reccomend it.	5.0	Best tv series ever made!	2002-04-14	3	2	1

I have the old VHS edition, the first DVD effort and now this ""restored"" DVD version and the VHS is STILL the only excellent version of this beloved mini-series.I had high hopes for the restored version, but it's still pretty bad.  The color is much much better than in the previous DVD -- much more vivid.  However, the color is still shifted way too much into the green-blue ""cool"" spectrum and the result is vivid, but very cold looking.  It lacks the warm golden tones of the VHS and the broadcast version that one sees on TV.However, the MAIN problem with the ""Restored"" version is that you can ONLY view the series in ""wide-screen"" format.  There are no alternate formats on the DVD.  This is a huge problem, because the film was directed and conceived for television, NOT for wide-screen.  A very serious difference:  it means the director composed each shot in such a way that it would look good on a square TV screen and NOT on a wide film screen.  The new wide-screen version is awful:  it drains all the energy and vibrancy out of each frame and creates scenes that are extremely static.  It's not very thrilling to watch the show's characters constantly surrounded by big gaps of space.  There's a myth being spread that wide-screen format is always better, but ask any filmmaker -- it only works if the piece was originally conceived for wide-screen.We tried to watch this version and we got through exactly one episode before we simply couldn't take it any more.  We pulled out the TV set, unhooked the DVD player, dragged down the VHS player from storage, hooked it in and happily watched the rest of the show on the old VHS tapes.My big fear is that my VHS tapes will someday degrade and there STILL won't be a decent DVD version.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A21MY0W0L1O1BU	bookjunkiereviews	To be honest, I have seen the previous edition (now off the market) and not this latest updated version which is apparently of higher quality. The DVD (first edition) was not bad; it just didn't do justice to the film quality. The ability to view particular scenes was not bad, and so was the ability to go to a particular time (say, 1 hour 57 mins into the film). What that DVD was missing was all the little extras - such as how the film was made, the interviews with the stars. If I were honest, I would say that the two major advantages of having the DVD version would be 1) the DVD takes up less space than the 6 cassette set. 2) the DVD allows you to go directly to a favorite scene (for me, the dance with Mr Darcy at Netherfield) and view it obsessively. If this new edition has more features as promised, and if the technical quality is much better, I would definitely consider upgrading, even though I already have the VHS set and the book. I am not bothering to rave on about the story or the acting and directing. For those, I recommend you read the other reviews. Basically, if you love Jane Austen (or for that matter, costume dramas set in England) you will love this production. If you don't like slowly-evolving stories with little overt physical passion, you may hate this DVD and consider it over-long at some 6 hours. But then again, you probably won't want to buy this DVD in the first place.	4.0	Review based on previous edition...	2001-08-28	11	11	0

That adaptation does not hold a candle to this one, which came about ten years before it. This five-hourish film explores Austen's novel beautifully, so much so that you begin to believe that there can only be one Mr. Darcy: Colin Firth, and likewise with Jennifer Ehl's Elizabeth Bennet. Because this film is so long and detailed, the characters are given time to develop, to make you care about them. The scenery is beautiful, the script is very close to the novel, the acting is magnificent...there is really nothing lacking in this beautiful, amazing film.	5.0	My favorite adaptation by far	2011-09-13	0	0	0

I have always enjoyed the roles I've seen Peter Firth in but I found his reprisal of Mr. Darcy to be downright boring. Also, I found the woman who played Lizzy's mother to be so shrill that I winced every time she came on screen. I kept waiting for the film to get better as the minutes wore on - but no such luck.

But having read the book, how can anyone argue this A&E; version starring Jennifer Ehrle as not being a truer depiction of Elizabeth Bennet?  To have one reviewer go as far as to comment on Jennifer's weight was appalling to say the least. The weight of women in that time were not a waifish size 1 as in the Keira Knightley portrayal.I wholeheartedly agree in OPINION that this Jane is not attractive but I also acknowledge that would be my opinion for THIS day and age.  Soft, non-descript features were considered very attractive in past times i.e. Mona Lisa.  Look at your historical figures for both genders in that time and those who had non-descript features were considered the beauties in their day.Jennifer's portrayal is that of the mature, sensible, sharp Lizzy that Jane Austen wrote of and who both Lizzy's father and Mr. Darcy loved.  With that said, she did an exceptional job.I love this version, but because of it's length I do not watch as often as the newer P&P; version.  They both are very great cinematic pieces and would be an asset to anyone's Jane Austen collection.	5.0	THIS is Jane Austen's version - not Hollywood's	2008-02-26	6	4	2

The movie follows the book to the letter and allows Jane Austen's sense of humor and rich characters shine through. Partly this is due to the casting of Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, as the main characters, who have wonderful chemistry. You will want to own  this one to watch over and over again. Plan for a weekend as you won't want to stop in all six tapes as the suspense grows. I applaud the BBC for a polished piece of what entertainment should be.I recommend Emma Thompson's adaption of Sense and Sensibility. And for those who prefer realistic tragedy I recommend Tess of the D'urbervilles starring Justine Waddel. Also high on my list is Wives &amp; Daughters starring Justine Waddel.	5.0	A Stunning Masterpiece!	2003-03-05	2	2	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2RV08AUZAAKQZ	brella	You are probably already convinced of the excellence of this Austen classic and of the exceedingly skilled A&amp;E adaptation, but you might not know that the dvd version is not up to dvd standards.  I'm not sure,  but from my dvd player it looks to be just a transfer from the vhs, or  something.  If one is not keen on the dvd price tag, one may as well simply  buy or rent it on video.  However, if you have not seen this A&amp;E  adaptation, I hasten to add that any lover of Austen's book will likely  cite it as the best movie/tv rendition of the classic to date.  With a  length &amp; pace that can finally do justice to the novel, faithfulness to  the story, full utilization of Austen's witty dialogue, and nigh perfect  casting, there is little that this version can be criticized for.  The  music, locations, &amp; costuming are also irreproachable.  Believe me, if  you want to see Darcy, Mr. &amp; Mrs Bennett, Catherine De Burgh, the  silliness of the younger Bennett sisters, and Caroline Bingley done  absolutely and resoundingly RIGHT, you'll watch the A&amp;E version.  And  if you by some cruel trick of fate have been unable to read the Austen  original, the A&amp;E adaption is a perfect introduction.	4.0	exceptional production quality but for the dvd format itself	2000-02-21	50	48	2

Apparently, Fielding's Bridget Jones books were inspired by her admiration of the BBC &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; production.This 5 1/2 hour version, whose script faithfully follows Austin's dialogue, is my favorite movie.  Though I have viewed it many times, I never fail to be captivated by the actors' performances.  Without exception, the talented actors are perfectly cast, particularly Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth as Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy.  They are wonderful together!  In my opinion, Colin Firth deserves special praise.  This excellent actor can say so much with a gesture, a change in facial expression, or merely by  a look in his eyes.I have viewed both the VHS and DVD versions.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the quality of the DVD is not particularly good. It played reasonably well on my first inexpensive DVD player, but tends to &quot;jump&quot; occasionally on my newly purchased higher quality player.

No other production I have seen compares to the insight given to Jane Austen's characters. Although Lawrence Olivier is touted as the best Darcy, I believe he perceived and played the role with an excessive amount of aristocratic behavior. Darcy was landed gentry, not titled. The A&E/BBC production stayed true to Ms. Austen's writing. And did not change either Darcy's or Lizzy's classic speeches in the proposal scene - not true in the new theatrical release. Also to the credit of this production is the close adherence to the social mores of the time - absolutely not true in other productions. I believe this production is tribute to Ms. Austen and I wish all would see it.	5.0	Watch it over and over and over	2005-11-29	5	4	1

I've not seen its like on television before; nor do I expect to see its like again. It was superb. It was almost perfect - though not quite.It is  rare to find a Jane Austen dramatisation that comes so near to being perfect on every level and that stays so true to the original novel. The greater part of the dialogue in the series is Jane Austen's own and every scene is  included and follows the same chronological order. The drama departs from the novel in only two instances. In order to extend our knowledge of the characters of Darcy(Colin Firth), and Mr Collins(David Bamber), two scenes are added; to demonstrate that Darcy is not just an effete aristocrat but a real man worthy of Elizabeth's love we are shown him indulging in manly pursuits; fencing, and swimming in his private lake (it puzzles me why so many women seem to drool over his wet-shirt scene); and to demonstrate that Mr Collins is an idiotic, narrow-minded prude we are shown him trembling with embarrassment and horror when he happens to come across Lydia (Julia Sawalha) in a state of dishabille. David Bamber makes Mr Collins deliciously toadying and obsequious. A remarkable piece of acting.It is its faithfulness to the original that makes this drama so good. No one has ever written a more tightly plotted novel. Its series of climaxes make the novel difficult to put down; just as one plot-line reaches its climactic conclusion, another is building. And the duel of wits and sharp dialogue between Darcy and Elizabeth (Jennifer Ehle) as they get to know each other is entrancing. And then comes that moment. She is at the piano befriending Darcy's sister, Georgiana (Emilia Fox), when he holds her gaze with a silent declaration of his love and admiration. This involved a fine piece of editor-timing; a split second either way, either too long or too short, and the poignancy of that moment would have been lost.  It is interesting to compare Colin Firth's Darcy with that of Lawrence Olivier's Darcy in the Hollywood film. Olivier falsely portraits him as appealingly shy and self-conscious. But Darcy was in no way shy, he was just proud, with  every reason to have a good opinion of himself. He found it impossible to imagine  that anyone in a lower strata of society, living in a  small provincial town, could be his equal - until he met Elizabeth!However, I felt there was one weak link in the chain of superb acting; Alison steadman. Many will disagree but I think she over-acted, turning her Mrs Bennet into a nerve-grating, neurasthenic caricature. But apart from that, I heartily recommend this video. Don't miss it. You'll not see its like again. I must just mention the charming piano music by Carl Davis, so beautifully evocative of a beautiful period in history (for the rich).	5.0	Absolutley unsurpassable	2000-10-31	11	11	0

Frankly, I'm glad to know there is not something mentally wrong with me! (yes, its THAT good.)This A&E;/BBC series is without flaw, and in fact, quite addicting.  I saw this on A&E; several years ago and was enthralled, and recently purchased the video set so I could see it again.  It recaptured me immediately!  It is almost impossible to watch just one tape per evening, so have 4 1/2 hours of free time available so you can watch the whole thing.  Be prepared you will find yourself remembering scenes for days afterwards...it stays with you.  It can be watched again and again and will enchant every time.Colin Firth (Darcy) smolders, Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth) enchants, the entire case is perfectly played.  The story and this production leaves you believing these characters actually lived. In fact, I recently saw Jennifer Ehle in another movie and was struck by the reality she is in fact an actress and not really Elizabeth!The scenery, costuming and music are just as engaging as the story.  A beautiful production all around and an investment that will be rewatched again and again.	5.0	Gorgeous and wonderful!	2002-01-02	7	7	0

The movie follows the book very closely and most of the dialogue is from the book.  I agree with the other readers that it is very enjoyable and hard to not watch in one sitting.  Colin Firth is great as Mr. Darcy.  His looks are very expressive.  I think he captures the Darcy of the book perfectly.  The only criticism I have with the movie is that there are a couple scenes where they didn't bring out the drama from the book.  When Elizabeth reads Darcy's letter after her refusal of his marriage proposal, they do not have her read the whole letter, nor do they show the change of her feelings after she reads the letter when she realized how wrong she had been to be so blindly partial to Wyckham and so blindly prejudiced against Darcy.  Also, when he leaves her after she tells him her sister ran off with Wyckham, the movie doesn't portray the agony she goes through in the book.  In the book, she realizes she loves him now, but thinks she will never see him again because how could he associate with her when her sister has this relationship with his enemy Wyckham?  A sentence or two from her would have been great there.  She does say, ""I will never see him again"" in the movie, but just a little more would have brought out her agony.  The movie is fantastic, though.  Enjoy!"	5.0	Excellent film and true to the book	2005-08-04	2	2	0

In the first edition, the colors are washed out flat, and the overall look is quite muddy and blah. In the second version, the colors are kind of blown out, with far too much contrast for my eyes. However, the second (newer) version at least HAS some color in it, and because of  the widescreen presentation, it is my overall favorite.I'm afraid this wonderful series must have been shot with untalented lighting people using inferior film. It's the only way to explain such [cruddy] transfers...in two tries! Nevertheless, the acting and story make this well worth it, and for those reasons alone, I recommend purchase.	3.0	6 of one, half dozen of the other	2001-10-05	4	1	3

I now watch it over and over and still find subtleties that I have never noticed before.  If I should wear out my current DVD's...which is possible with how much I watch it...I would have to immediately purchase a new copy.  This has been my best entertainment investment ever!  You can see other reviews that explain the plot and the characters.  I find some characters very annoying and sometimes skip over those parts...but they are supposed to be annoying characters, so no discredit to the actors. The engaging characters more than make up for it.  The color and sound are exquisite in the version I bought.  For example, when wearing headphones and watching it I can hear the clock on the mantle ticking behind me, plus other subtle sounds.  Some period films use low lighting for indoor scenes at night.  I understand this sensibility to historical accuracy, but I do not enjoy watching them.  This production uses well lighted scenes throughout.  If you want ""in your face"" plot, then this DVD may not be for you. However, I absolutely adore the scene where Mr. Darcy's face glows as Elizabeth sings and plays at his estate. It is very, very subtle. Then, seeing how Elizabeth deftly handles an inquiry by Miss Bingly about Mr. Wickham while at Darcy's estate...I can count multiple reasons why this is one of the most well crafted scenes in all of English literature.  (Okay, I am nothing close to a literature critic...so this is just an ordinary citizen's opinion.)  This one scene resolves so many issues in the story, and so elegantly. If you want an in your face storyline...and demand something that explains it to you, this DVD is not for you.  If you don't mind subtleties, thinking about what you are watching, and want historical romance - this is the DVD you absolutely cannot pass up."	5.0	OMG!  My Favorite Movie Ever!	2011-08-15	2	2	0

This is not on either of the DVDs.The first DVD is great. It does have credits breaking up the individual parts of the original series but all in all the quality is close to the original tapes.However the latest Special Edition has lost the softness gained by using film instead of tape which I think helped the original. This version is sharper with far too much contrast. It's just a generally harsher look to the whole thing which I am sure the producers would hate.

Colin Firth is phenomenal (the advantage of DVD is that in the scene when he's watching Elizabeth play piano, you can freeze it and the frame doesn't waver). The set, the costumes, and the supporting cast are wonderful, and the directing takes P+P light years beyond the stereotypical British minimal camera movement and long takes. A period piece with editing and close-ups!The Austen faithful will see few deviations from the book (yes, Darcy becomes more of a sex object, no, it's not something to complain about!). It's hard to convey in film form the ironic commentary of Austen's narration that's a trademark of her books, but the miniseries manages to compensate. The dance scene, where Elizabeth and Darcy engage in debate whenever the choreography brings them close enough to talk, always makes me laugh, and you'll especially love the supporting cast. Jane, Bingley, Miss Bingley, and Lady Catherine are among my favorites. There's a definite acting challenge but a certain appeal to love story set in a more conservative time- the cast does a wonderful job creating characters you want to hug, cheer on, slap, or just marry yourself!The DVD extras aren't anything extraordinary, but the size, price, and picture/sound quality in contrast to six tapes makes it worthwhile. You can skip around to your favorite scenes much more efficiently without constantly changing tapes, and if you're like me, it's a vast relief not to have to worry about wearing out your favorite spots.If you like Jane Austen. If you like romance. If you like good acting, snappy and intelligent dialogue, and a story you can sink your teeth into, watch this miniseries. If you've never seen it before, watch it NOW. Get the girls together for a P+P fest, picking your favorite dresses, estates, and shots of Colin Firth. I guarantee you won't regret it.	5.0	What's not to love?	2002-01-31	18	17	1

My wife &amp; I own the VHS tape set, and have watched them over &amp; over, so I was very excited to get the DVD version in hopes that it would be even prettier &amp; more lush than the tapes.  But the lovely settings, rich costumes &amp; etc are obliterated by the extreme over-exposed whitewash that the &quot;digital remastering&quot; has created.  The characters all look like ghosts!  We have gone back to watching the tapes.In short, the story is wonderful, the acting extraordinary, the casting, etc, etc, perfect, but this DVD version is really, really bad.	2.0	DVD version is UGLY	2001-10-14	8	5	3

Such a great rendition of this classic book... other than a few add-ins (typical to all films made from books), the series follows right along with Jane Austen's novel.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A21VGNU5959O85	CaterpillarGirl	"This deserves 10 stars....or more...a constellation.  This is in my top five favorite movies of all time. I watch it every couple of months because I physically miss the characters, I know that's kind of mental isn't it? The first time I saw it, I was riveted to the screen, no one could talk around me, I think I snapped when someone started eating chips. Pride and Prejudice, or as we call it around our house ""my movie"" as in ""I am going to watch my movie tonight, either watch it with me or go out with your friends"", is full of comedy, romance, mystery and a touch of action here and there. Although the writers of the screenplay took liberties with Austen's work, it still holds true to the original story I grew up with. Colin Firth is perfectly cast as Darcy, the right amount of snobbery and smolder, Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth can be identified with by all women and she pulls the emotions of that character out of her soul like a pro. The rest of the cast, her sisters, Darcy's friends, everyone has their part in the well oiled machine and without them working as well as they did together, this might have been a different movie. There is a book called ""The making of Pride and Prejudice"" by Susie Conklin, its well worth the read on how this movie came to be, how they cast it, the locations, costumes, how they all spent time off, there is a funny story about how the men had to wear hair nets in between takes and how embarrassed they all were about it. ANYWAY You must buy this movie, Although I have yet to buy it on DVD yet because I am waiting for a better transfer, I have seen it and the colors are off, so is the sound. The VHS version will do until they make it better. Sidenote..my husband who is 24 loves this movie, and will admit it even to his closest friends."	5.0	Better than ice cream.	2005-08-17	9	7	2

I thought her looking too old for 21 and not much fire as Lizzie. Colin used his emotions with his fabulous eyes in  showing his feelings. The love that was showed in them in the piano scene with Lizzie and his sister left no doubt of his love for Lizzie. I also did not care for the shrieking mother, she grated on my nerves like sqeaky chalk, and I moved the scenes around so I did not have to endure her. Wickum looked like he was in his 40s tho he was supposed to be of the same age as Darcy.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2CHIIEL98BBQW	Cayce Utley	One of Jane Austen's finest works, Pride and Prejudice, has come to video in a magical production by Simon Langton.  Colin Firth plays a spectacular role as Mr. Darcy, giving the character the life that Jane Austen penned  him to lead.  Relatively ingenue Jennifer Ehle is the embodiment of  Austen's Elizabeth Bennet.  Jane Austen's work is being done justice in  film these days- from Emma Thomspons' beautifully adapted Sense and  Sensiblity, to Gweneth Paltrow's portrayal of Emma.  In recent years, both  Thompson and Paltrow have been recognized for their spectacular ability.  Unfourtunately, an A&amp;E production such as this could not have been  recognized at the Oscars, but it is apparent that this cast and crew  deserve the same noteworthy recognition as the actors that have been in a  larger Jane Austen production have received. Pride and Prejudice is  definitely a smart buy and most assuredly an entertaining film to see.	5.0	Masterful Novel becomes Masterful Film	1999-04-09	1	1	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3VIOCJZ22JZXT	C. B Collins Jr.	"This version of Pride and Prejudice is the finest adaptation of a novel to film - no joke. It is a favorite of my entire family and whenever we have shown it to other friends and relatives, they always fall in love with this superb masterpiece. The acting and settings can not be surpassed. The five hour length is perfect to convey the nuance and subtle character and plot development. I have watched it three times and every time I am tempted to watch the entire film all the way through. After viewing it three times, I would like to comment on three aspects of the film: the character of Elizabeth Bennett, the character development of Mr. Darcy, and the benevolent and compassionate world view that undergrids Austin's work.First, Elizabeth Bennett is surely one of the most likeable heroines in literature. Jennifer Ehle plays Elizabeth Bennett with exceptional skill - it just can't be done better than Ehle's performance. Yet it is Harold Bloom's commentary on Elizabeth Bennett that I found most refreshing and in line with my own assessment. Bloom aserts that the representation of women, especially young women, in novels prior to Pride and Prejudice, were somewhat empty headed and required direction from more worldly males, some of whom turned out to be scoundrels. Thus the innocent, flower-like young woman does not have within her head common sense and good judgement and must be guided by a man. She must rely on her elders to help her select such a man. However with Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austin creates a young woman character with as much judgement as Henry Kissinger, as much of a moral compass as Billy Graham, and all the social graces of Jackie Kennedy Onassis.  Austin blows to bits the prejudicial and demeaning view of young women as weak wisps requiring guidance. Even when Elizabeth Bennett makes a misjudgement, she is introspective and insightful enough to make a courageous mid-course correction. Her bitter rejection of Darcy's first proposal of marriage burned her rejecting words into his soul and yet through continued exposure to Darcy and the opportunity to see his true multifaceted character, she changes her perception and grows to love him. Witness her wisdom as she confronts her withdrawn father, as he hides in his study, as the youngest daughter almost brings the family to ruin through her outlandish folly and lack of maturity. Elizabeth Bennett exhibits considerable psychological strength of character and judgement. Sometimes she makes mistakes, but she is fluid enough to change her mind, to reassess, and in the end she loves a man that has grown to love her more with each passing day. Austin wrote in a time when upperclass women had to plot and scheme to marry well, since this was their entire financial and social future. Elizabeth Bennett, through her independent thinking, is above this demeaning chaos, and ends up with a man that can be her equal life partner. Elizabeth Bennett is one of my favorite people!Second, the character development of Mr. Darcy is strategic, realistic, and honors the fact that as multifaceted individuals we sometimes don't look or act our best but we can all be redeemed, we can all improve. Colin Firth plays Darcy to the letter. He captures Darcy in his arrogance and pride as he undermines Jane Bennett's love interest. Firth does a wonderful job in which Darcy first proposes to Elizabeth against his own best judgement. He is shocked and dismayed and then hurt as Elizabeth rightfully puts him in his place for his insulting proposal of marriage. Darcy is also a wonderful character. A man who falls in love with a beautiful, charming and wise woman but a woman for which he must strive to become all that he can be to obtain. In the character of Darcy Jane Austin has captured the ability of love of another person to propel someone to develope into and become the absolute most they can achieve. She captures the truth that character developes not only through hardship and perseverance but that our character develops through our loving relationships.Third, in her treatment of the vast army of outrageous characters Jane Austin unfolds a moral universe. As Mr. Bennett says: ""God has placed us on the earth to laugh at our neighbor's folly and for our neighbor to laugh at ours."" Jane Austin shows compassion and justice to every character, no matter how idiotic and silly, for she realizes that much in human life is idiotic, silly, and folly but also, much in human life is precious and loving and sublime.I noticed that 753 people had reviewed this film before me. That alone should give you a clue that this is a classic masterpiece of drama and filmaking."	5.0	The all time winner	2005-11-12	28	23	5

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	ADU5Y4A86JZLP	C. Cook	This film is, indeed, utter perfection.  For those who quibble over the minor variations from the book, I encourage you to write and produce a better film from this sparkling book. Every change/addition is justified, every scene luminious, every performance practically perfect.  This is as close to being a filmed realization of the novel as one could ever hope for.That being said, the dvd could be better for such a beloved production.  Where is the six hour commentary that all of us die-hard fans would love to listen to?  Where are deleted scenes or snippets of scenes?  Where are bloopers and outtakes or an exhaustive 2 hour making-of documentary?  For a Special Edition, many of us have been waiting for this kind of treatment that lesser theatrical films get all the time.  I know this is A&amp;E/BBC territory and their resources are not the same as Warner Bros. for instance, but we fans will continue to wish for more features.  All in all, though, the series is a sparkling diamond of exquisite cut; the dvd is competent and serviceable until someone produces the &quot;ultimate&quot; special edition.	5.0	Do I even need to say it?	2003-11-19	2	2	0

Court	I think it will be repetitive to say how wonderful this movie is, especially if you are a Jane Austen fan or a lover of classical stories and period movies. I was very surprised, however, to discover that this is the first movie I have ever seen that is true to the novel. In fact most of the dialogue in the movie are quoted word for word from the novel. Here's why - in some instances where I had difficulty understanding the dialogue because Colin Firth (Mr. Darcy) mumbles a lot or speaks very softly, I took the book from my shelf and read the corresponding chapter. It was amazing, I ended up re-reading the novel as I viewed the movie as if having the manuscript in my hand. This is a beautiful adaptation and certainly a beautiful love story. Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth Bennet) truly deserved the BAFTA best actress award.	5.0	True to the Novel, beautiful adaptation.	2002-07-15	2	2	0

Some weeks ago I discovered by accident that it did!  You won't find the subtitles under the DVD menu...... you have to TURN ON THE CLOSED CAPTION OPTION of your television or DVD player!Most of our TVs have a menu of some sort where you set the contrast, color, audio, etc. (consult your TV manual)  I had turned on the closed caption setting for another video and forgot to turn it off.  Days later I popped in this video to keep me company while doing the laundry, and when I looked up from my work I was shocked to see letters at the bottom of the screen!  I thought the laundry detergent was making me hallucinate!Finally, after *years* of straining to hear what Mr. Hurst mumbled at the end of the breakfast scene where Mr. Bingley had invited Elizabeth to stay, I now understand what he said and why Mrs. Hurst was so vexed: ""Is there any sport today or not?""What I do not know is if all TV models have a closed caption setting.  I could have sworn I tried it at my parents' home when I first got this 3 years ago and was desperate for the subtitles, but nothing showed then and I foolishly gave up trying it on other TVs.  Although it could have been because I had it on the wrong setting.  Some TVs have more than one option under Closed Caption.  For instance, the TV here at my house has CC1, CC2, CC3, Text1, Text2, and Off when you select the Closed Caption menu, and the subtitles for P&P; came out with CC1 selected.If you're playing the video on your computer, check if your DVD player software has a closed caption setting.  My computer uses DVD Play.  It has a Closed Caption setting with only On and Off as the options and it works fine there, too.I hope it works for you, so you can rediscover this wonderful TV series all over again, just like I am now more than 20 viewings later!:)"	5.0	Yes!

Any adaptation has the onus of making the problems at the heart of the story understandable to a contemporary audience.  This production does a spectacular job of negotiating the landmines of Regency society that threaten the course of the heart. It also elucidates the subplots in such a way as to throw the stakes of the primary story into relief.  The brief scene in which Elizabeth Bennett's friend Charlotte quietly reveals how she manages to live in an unromantic marriage is powerful.  But back to our heroes, Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy:  Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth's performances just pick up and sing.  They mesh stunningly.  All of the actors do, there's not one misstep.  The settings are lush, the camera work perfect.  The Regency costumes and hair are well done, something worthy of note since too many period productions overblow them.  Note to fans of the Bridget Jones books:  this is THAT version of Pride and Prejudice, THAT Colin Firth, THAT pond-plunge scene.	5.0	The Best	2001-01-09	32	31	1

I have seen many of the different movie interpretations, and this by far is my favorite. It follows fairly close to the book (more than the other movies I have seen) and has a great chemistry between the main characters, Elizabeth and Darcy. If you're looking for a great, classic love story-this is it. I read a few negative reviews about the restoration quality, but I didn't notice any issues. It's better than the previous version's video quality. There are a few darker scenes where it can be harder to make out all the details (like around the edges of the screen), but I think that is more due to the original film. It's not going to be super awesome high definition, like a current day HD or Bluray movie, but I didn't have any issues watching it on my large screen LCD tv. There is also a lot of great bonus material included with the DVDs, mostly ""making of"" with commentary from some of the original actors.

However, if I could only have one, I'd choose the one with Keira Knightley for a couple of reasons. This version is not as visually pleasing and the emotions of the actors are not as visible on their faces. Mrs. Bennett grates horribly in this version, while in the other version, she is pardonable because of her obvious warmth toward her family. I do enjoy watching Colin Firth in this one, and Mr. Collins is superbly smarmy, more so than in the other version. One can really empathize with Elizabeth's repulsion toward his proposal to her. I do like the fact that this version ends with an actual wedding, which is implied in the other version. However, I don't often have 5 hours available to watch it from beginning to end, which loses some of the momentum when trying to see it repeatedly.	4.0	Excellent, but restrained	2007-03-02	9	7	2

(Don't worry, I won't review them!)The second refers to the less important matter of the rest of the movie:This is THE P&P; movie. It has a cult following. It follows the book almost to the letter like no movie-from-a-book I have ever seen. It is the fastest six hours you will ever spend on a movie (thank you Jane Austen for a great story!) - and you WILL watch all 6 at once. It's unavoidable! Not only that, you'll watch it repeatedly.I can't, and won't, try to describe the importance and greatness of this movie. I shant waste my time - the rating it has received can do that just fine. However, the acting is superb, the quality of the DVD is excellent, the music and scenery are wonderful. It goes to show how great movies can be, especially those based on well-known books, when care is taken focus on the story and to tell it correctly, not be in a tizzy to fit it within the average idiot's attention span, or to be so engrossed in showing boobs and slapstick that you forget movies can be good without them. Besides, when the story is already popular, there is NO need to rewrite it. It's called PLOT, Hollywood! Give it a try!(...)P.S. Colin!	5.0	THE DEFINITIVE P&P | Mmm.....Colin	2006-02-20	5	4	1

It is a beatifully done version - sweeping scenery, great characters (and the actors portraying them) and excellent interpretation of a wonderful story.  I have seen other versions, but find this one to be the best.  I know that it is long movie, but in order to fully understand the characters and why they think and act the way they do, it is well worth watching.  As I said, I first saw it a couple of years ago and when I decided I wanted to purchase this particular version, I was astonished to find that it was made about 15 years ago.  Colin Firth is dashing as Mr. Darcy, Jennifer Ehle is wonderful as Elizabeth ""Lizzie"" and Susannah Harker as Jane gives you a real feel for the characters and the time period.  I really love this movie and enjoy it every time I watch it.  You don't really have to watch the entire movie if you don't have the time, just the last 2 episodes makes for good watching, but it will leave you wanting more - so watch the whole movie - it's worth it - AND YES - it's a chick flick but one worth watching."	5.0	Great story told beautifully	2010-10-07	1	1	0

Goette ""Book Geek"""	"I'm reticent to look at any production and say, ""This is the definitive interpretation of the book!"" but A&E;'s Pride and Prejudice makes a good case for such a statement.Austen fans will be enthralled with a production that adheres to the book AND is entertaining to watch.  The costumes, sets, music, and direction are excellent.  The casting couldn't have been better.  Jennifer Ehle makes a perfect Lizzie, Colin Firth is perfect as Mr. Darcy, and the two have excellent chemistry.  The Bennets are well cast as individuals and work well as an ensemble; I have no trouble believing them as a family unit.  Julia Sawalha is a particular standout as Lydia, and you'll really enjoy watching Mary (Lucy Briers) try to flirt with the brilliantly cast Mr. Collins ( David Bamber).The ""movie"" originally aired as a five-part mini series, so, while it runs fairly smoothly, there are still parts where you could easily stop the DVD if you just don't have a 5-hour block to watch TV.  There aren't a lot of extras, but the ones present are worth viewing.If you can buy only one Austen production, choose this one.  It's awesome."	5.0	You NEED to see this one!	2006-06-09	10	10	0

There are plenty of excellent reviews about the mini-series itself, and I obviously agree with all the positive ones because I spent the money for my own Blu-Ray two-disk set. Mostly I just wanted a good, old favorite to test out the new player, and P&P; is one of my all-time best loved series/movies. I've watched it on everything from a standard television during its original broadcast, to DVD, to YouTube. So I knew it would be an enjoyable experience, but what I wasn't prepared for was what a difference the remastering made in my overall viewing pleasure.Colors are more vibrant (though almost a bit oversaturated at points, flesh colors get very red and bright, in spots), to the point where I was surprised to see the subtle, but distinct colors in the sisters' dresses (I had thought they were ALL a sort of off-white), background colors, paintings, wallpapers, furniture, and the richness of Colin Firth's wardrobe--even the lights of the candles on desks and tables were warm and luminous. I had always loved this film for its story, now I could really appreciate the artistry involved.I agree with a previous reviewer who complained about some grain in certain scenes, especially the opening shots with Darcy and Bingley riding around Netherfield, but at no point did it detract from the overall improvement in the look of the film, nor would it dissuade me from buying this film in this format, if you love the story as much as I do. This is now my preferred way to watch this film, and while I'll enjoy it any way I can, I will always want to see it this way, if possible. If you're a fan of this mini-series I can't recommend this format highly enough.One note: after I put it in and was blown away by the beauty of the thing, I said ""wow"" rather loudly, and my wife walked in and I told her I was watching the Blu-Ray version of Pride and Prejudice. She looked at the screen and asked. ""Is it any different? Looks the same, to me.""ADDED NOTE: Having seen the whole series and all the extras now in this format, I'm more convinced than ever that it's a massive improvement. There's also a ""making of"" the remastering short that explains how this was taken entirely from the original Super 16 negatives using a new, recently invented process, when all the other version were taken from prints. So you've never seen a version as good as this, even on laser disk. Fantastic work by all concerned."	5.0	Blu-Ray Pride	2009-08-11	13	13	0

Those who have read &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; know that Bridget has a huge crush on Mr. Darcy as played by Colin Firth.  In the movie version of the book, of course, Colin Firth plays Bridget's love interest, Mark Darcy.  So I bought P&amp;P sight unseen because I was utterly impressed with Colin Firth's performance in &quot;Bridget Jones&quot;--and I wanted to see what the big deal was with the scene where he dives into the lake.P&amp;P is now my favorite movie.It is a wonderful adaptation of Jane Austin's novel--probably the best version ever made.  It is very nearly word-for-word, as a matter of fact, which is why the movie is so long.  It also makes reading the novel even more enjoyable, because I now have Alison Steadman's voice in my head whenever I read Mrs. Bennett's dialogue!The actors' performances are exquisite.  Colin Firth IS Mr. Darcy in a way nobody else could possibly be.  Jennifer Ehle is a wonderful Elizabeth--she has such a spirit and presence about her.  And I must say, Crispin Bonham-Carter's Mr. Bingley is just as good-natured and vacuous as he should be.The only complaint I have with this movie is that there are no programmed subtitles.  I have an excellent ear for English accents, but I had a problem understanding a few lines.There is no better way to spend 5 hours than enjoying this movie.  By all means, save your breath to cool your porridge, and fall in love with Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy!	5.0	All Hail Colin Firth!	2004-01-28	2	2	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2JLA1MWW6SHYC	"""child_burning_heart"""	I believe I have reviewed this miniseries about- oh, seven times.  But every time I watch it, I cannot help but express my admiration by writing one more review.The production is perfect in every detail.  They unfortunately cut out quite a bit of enjoyable dialogue between our main characters (Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy) towards the end of the novel, and they added a few gratutious scenes, but who can blame them?  They were so carried away by the sheer mystery and intrigue of Darcy's character that they simply MUST elaborate.  I want to particularly commend the casting agents in choosing so formidable an actor as Colin Firth for the part of Darcy.  Since he is as close to a real-life Darcy as we will ever get, no one could have brought life to our handsome hero better.  Though he made Darcy seem more morose and less lively than in the novel (smile, Colin, smile!  You DO have teeth, don't you?), I can't imagine a better job being done by a human- see the normally splendid Laurence Olivier botch the part entirely in an earlier production.  Firth recently starred in a similar story, I am told, called &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot;.  One reveiwer summed up Firth's character in such a way as to describe our Darcy fairly well- &quot;He lurks on the sidelines, looking luscious but still acting emotionally constipated.&quot;  Or, &quot;Firth, on the other hand (as opposed to Hugh Grant) must unbend to become lovable, and we love him then mainly because we know what trouble it was for him.&quot;  It seems Colin is fairly typecast. (&lt;:  He has a lovesick, yet intense look about him that throws him into the &quot;tormented misanthrope with a heart of gold&quot; role every time.As for Jennifer Ehle, who plays the lovely and bewitching Elizabeth Bennet, she has the &quot;fine eyes&quot; and the sparkling wit for the role.  Though her phsyique does not match the description in the book (what little there is, anyway), there wasn't much you can do when faced with such a splendid actress.  She had a wonderful way of attempting to force words out at certain times, looking for all the world like a sensible young woman suddenly losing her grip on reality and passionately wishing for a marital union that she beleived could never be.  Mostly she did this towards the end when Darcy would come a-calling with good friend Bingley (Cripsin Bonham-Carter), who in turn was in pursuit of Elizabeth's older sister Jane.  Complicated?  Yes.  But really fun.We watch with delight as Elizabeth's early derision of Darcy gradually turns to tolerance, then to friendship, then to love.  The plot goes thusly.  Elizabeth Bennet, a very sensible and clever lady of twenty, has a silly mother, a disinterested father, and three idiotic younger sisters (not to mention a kindhearted older one).  The sly army officer Wickham's (Adrian Lukas) lies (or rather half-truths) about Darcy support Elizabeth's ill-informed opinion of that great gentleman, formed at a party wherein he stood in the corner and glared.  When she learns the truth about Wickham's deplorable conduct with Darcy's younger sister upon Darcy's ill-fated marriage proposal to Elizabeth (he loves her passionately even though she is beneath him in social status), she very nearly kills herself with remorse.  She made a terrible mistake- judging by first impressions.  &quot;One (man) has all the goodness (Darcy), and the other all the appearance of it (Wickham).&quot;  Later, when Wickham runs off with Elizabeth's thoughtless young sister, much in the same manner in which he attempted to elope with Darcy's, a mysterious rescuer finds out the naughty couple, and pays off Wickham to marry the idiot girl.  Could it be- Darcy? (&lt;: &quot;If you WILL thank me, let it be for yourself alone.  Your family owes me nothing...I beleive I thought only of you,&quot; he says the Elizabeth when she attempts to express her gratitude for his help.  He then proceeds to propose again, with greater sucess.  I do hope I haven't spoiled anything- ah well, the plot is transparent enough to begin with.  It is the delightful characters, not the hackneyed story, that capture out interest.  FIVE STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!	5.0	I can't stop reveiwing this darn thing! (&lt;:	2001-04-30	3	3	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A63NG5FC0WAH	Chris Bishop	"So I purchased this blu-ray to watch with my wife.  I was completely not expecting to get near the enjoyment out of it that I did.  The cast was absolutely splendid.  Not only that, but unlike the very short movie version, this version really allowed the plot to develop out.  The characters were exceptionally true to form.  I dont think I could think of anyone better to play Mr. Darcy then Colin Firth.  Elizabeth Bennett was also perfectly cast right down to the smiling eyes.  What made this movie more fun was I watched it in conjunction with reading the book so basically I got a very good minds eye view of the story.  I realize in fairness this was a mini series so it had alot more space to do the story properly, but I cannot think of a more convincing and accurate portrayal of the story then this version did.  Lines were given verbatim, but not robotically instead with full emotional inflection and the dialogue seemed smooth and flowing instead of forced.  If anyone has ever watched a high school performance of macbeth, and then seen a high end production of it, I would say that would be the difference between the movie and the mini series.  I am a guy who normally doesnt go in for ""chick flicks"" but I found not only the book but the movie to be excellent.  I was caught up in the time period, and the set pieces in this mini series were so gorgeous that I felt transported back to the time.  My wife also thoroughly enjoyed it, and it has inspired me to broaden my horizons and try other Austen novels.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A147ZSEFSA3OPC	Chris Cummings	This film truly transports the viewer into Jane Austen's world.  We are swept away into the breathtakingly beautiful 19th century English countryside, to a time where one's &quot;breeding&quot; is above all else in importance, where a woman's every fiber is bent and effort spent on a shrewd marital match, and genteel propriety (or at least the appearance of such) is a characteristic highly regarded and fiercely protected.The scenery is fantastic, as well as the costuming, and it seems that great attention was paid to even the minutest of details.The actors play their roles superbly, and I believe the casting director must be a genious (although I found Mrs. Bennett almost too annoying altogether.)  Austen's fans will be pleased, I think, at the production's faithfulness to the novel.  Very well-done and enjoyable.	5.0	A Fantastic Adaptation of a Beloved Novel	2002-01-04	3	3	0

DARCY, KISS UNTIL THEY ARE MARRIED...IN A CHURCH! THE RECENT VERSION, ONLY HINTS THAT POSSIBLY THEY ARE MARRIED.  FURTHER, THIS VERSION POINTS OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MARRIAGE AND EVEN SHOWS A PICTURE OF THE YOUNGEST SISTER & HER HUSBAND AS NOT BEING HAPPY AS THEIR MARRIAGE WAS BASED ON INFIDELITY & HER DISDAIN AT NOT HAVING A BIG, FANCY MILITARY WEDDING DUE TO THE INAPPOPRIATENESS OF THEIR ACTIONS.	5.0	SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE NEW RELEASE!	2007-08-04	8	1	7

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A38K8UHMSL27OP	Chrystal Webster	Pride and Prejudice is the best of Jane Autens books.  It catches the eyes of many schoolgirls with the handsome looks of Colin Firth.  I watch this movie nearly every 3 weeks and never tire of it, I know the words off by  heart and am also leading a school production on the play. Everything about  the play was just right and could not be changed. Elizabeth Bennett shows  that women do have an opinion whether it be it the past or the present. I  love this movie so much and hope to one day see it on the big screen at the  movies.It shows true love does come through in the end.To all those  Colin Firth fans out there if u haven't seen his real life pictures out of  the pride and prejudice costumes and without those side burns you should  not find out what he really looks like as it recks your whole opinion of  him and come to think twice about him.  Don't reck your image of him by  finding out what he really looks like. Peace, love and happiness to all.	5.0	Greatest movie ever	2000-03-14	1	1	0

I wasn't familiar with Colin Firth; albeit he might not have been as ""handsome and tall"" as described in the book, Colin Firth did an EXCELLENT job of portraying Darcy's constant state of irritation and disdain for the first half of the program. Minimal dialogue but his facial expressions and gestures were very consistent and true to those described in the book. Colin Firth's smile during the scene where Elizabeth Bennett was playing the fortepiano at Pemberly really showed the transformation in Darcy as described by Jane Austen. Jennifer Ehle, who played Elizabeth Bennett, was well cast, as her eyes did contain that liveliness described by Austen. Ehle was far prettier than her counterpart who played the sister Jane Bennett. The only segment I thought could be better was the last scene where Colin Firth/Darcy was supposed to be over-elated at Elizabeth accepting his renewed marriage proposal. Firth's expression was a bit mild compared to that described in the book. Lastly, I enjoyed the 3rd DVD, which contained cast interviews, a tour of the estates, etc. Definitely worth buying if you're a fan of Jane Austena and ""Pride and Prejudice""!"	5.0	Excellent portrayal of character!

As a mini series filmed in six installments (but as been put only onto two DVD discs), it is able to stay incredibly faithful to Jane Austen's masterpiece Pride and Prejudice. The plot and dialogue stay so close to Austen's novel and the characterizations are right on the mark.Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are positively magical in their roles of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Ehle brings the wit and independent nature of Elizabeth to life and Firth adds the proud, forebooding nature to Mr. Darcy. Other supporting actors do a marvalous job in bringing the other classic characters of Pride and Prejudice to life. The actors who play the ill-matched Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the conscending nature of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and the unscrupulous George Wickham are all faithful to their written characters.A wonderful visual portrait of nineteenth century England and high society. The cinematography, costumes and sets bring the entire ""gentleman's"" world to life.A most definite must-see!!! I guarantee you will be watching the entire mini series in one sitting!

Colin Firth is incredible as Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle makes a wonderful Elizabeth Bennet. It is much more on target than the Laurence Olivier version, though that might have as much to do with the fact that the BBC version is over twice as long as it does with the exceptional adaptation.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1T17LMQABMBN5	CoffeeGurl	Pride and Prejudice is my favorite Jane Austen novel and so I had to give the BBC/A&E mini-series a whirl.  I have always loved this series because it remains true to the novel and the actors' portrayals of the characters are precise and wonderful.  Jennifer Ehle did a wonderful job playing Elizabeth Bennett.  She is just as I'd imagined the intelligent and grounded Elizabeth to be when I pictured the heroine in my head.  But the actor that really captivated me was Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy.  He was so on the mark in his portrayal of the arrogant, taciturn and reluctantly besotted Darcy that I cannot picture another actor outdoing his performance.  This is the work that made me look at Colin Firth's career more closely.  The rest of the series is wonderful with the Bennett family -- the hilarious fortune-hunting mother, the sarcastic father, the sensible and beautiful Jane, and the silly younger sister Lydia.  The other characters were fun to watch coming to life.  The period costumes and the scenery of the British countryside are second to none.  Absolutely gorgeous!  As for the actual DVD, I agree with the people who say that the special A&E DVD edition isn't very good.  The picture quality left a lot to desire and the bonus features aren't any better.  That is why I give this DVD four stars instead of five.  Five stars for the series itself and two stars for the DVD.  But you'd want to have this in your collection if you love this series as much as I do.	4.0	A keeper for all Jane Austen and P&P fans!	2006-01-15	6	5	1

Colin Firth IS Mr Darcy and Jennifer Ehle was wonderful as Elizabeth.  I especially loved to watch their facial expressions--so much of what they felt or thought came through in their facial expressions alone.  The other actors were also top notch.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	Jane Austen's book is the story of 5 sisters (3 of which are well-developed) and their trials and tribulations in finding a husband.  In true Austen fashion, the girls are in poor financial straits, and their potential suitors are wealthy gentlemen for whom such a match would be unfavourable.  Throw in an improper mother, a sarcastic father, and a variety of colourful cousins, uncles, and friends, and you have an enjoyable farce.This BBC/A&amp;E production of Pride and Prejudice is a very faithful adaptation of the book.  At 5 hours, it can afford the time to introduce the extended characters of Austen's work without being rushed or confusing.  In fact, it is a great credit to the director, the casting, and the performers that so many characters are juggled with no confusion.  Notable performances are put forth by Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy and Alison Steadman as Mrs. Bennett.  The rest of the cast is uniformly good with, unfortunately, the exception of the lead character played by Jennifer Ehle.  She portrays Elizabeth as too amused, too little affected by criticism, and too friendly compared to Austen's characterisation.  In fact, the personalities of the characters Jane and Elizabeth seem to be juxtaposed in this miniseries.  This is a minor quibble, and Ehle improves as the story moves along.The sets and cimematography are also very nice.  The manor houses and grounds are lovingly photographed, without dwelling on them.  The action moves at a leisurely pace, appropriate for an Austen setting (and slower than modern movies tend to allow), which may put off some viewers.My main criticism is that this film is unnecessary.  It is too true an adaptation, which begs the question, &quot;Why not read the book instead?&quot;  It is a film that lazy high school English students will love.  However, if you are looking for a live version of this Austen classic, you'll not find a more faithful adaptation or better made film than this.	3.0	If anything, it's too close to the book	2002-07-04	21	4	17

So, we bought this Special Edition DVD for Christmas - repeated playing would wear out the VHS tapes.BAD thing about this DVD:Like many reviewers here had said already.  Awful awful colors, especially on the disk one. There is way too much contrast, bringing the lights and darks to extremes. The outdoor scenes hurt my eyes!  Everyone looks ill; and it's hard to tell where darkness end and hair starts on most characters. The furnitures have no detail, they just disappear into the darkness.GOOD things about this DVD:1) Widescreen, although I doubt that I missed anything on the VHS format.2) The removal of episodes end credits.3) It has the closed captioning (subtitle) in English.  It let me see what they are saying.Let the buyer beware!!	1.0	Awful colors on this Special Edition DVD	2001-12-26	15	10	5
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1YIYS3J7EQ3F8	"C. Santas ""Constantine/film buff"""	"Pride and Prejudice (1940, 1985, 1995)Cinema and television have produced three versions of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice that I know of. The first is the 1940 production (dir. Robert Z. Leonard), which Leonard Maltin's Guide absurdly gives four stars (****)! with Greer Garson playing Elizabeth Bennet, and Lawrence Olivier Mr. Darcy. Now this might not have been a bad choice, for Greer Garson is an excellent actress, but she seems a little (about ten years) too old for the youngish (20 years) Austen heroine. And as for Sir Lawrence, who could have objected to him--except that here he is just too smaltzy to be the stiff Darcy, too emotional (says ""I love you"") something that the actual Darcy in the novel never does. He has the looks and talent, but this whole production is off target. (Despite the literate group of screenwriters, which included Aldous Huxley. What could they have been thinking?) Too many absurdities in this one--including a barcarole a-la Venice in an English garden! And how about Lady Catherine de Bourgh planning Darcy's marriage to Elizabeth?Pride and Prejudice (1985)A much better--though much more modest--production was that of BBC in 1985 (with more advancement in decades, one would expect a more respect in filming literary masterpieces). This one features Elizabeth Garvie--a 20 year-old actress--playing a twenty-year-old, who has the looks, the energy, and the winsomeness of Elizabeth, although one has to admit that both acting and directing in this one occasionally show limitations of budget and talent. But at least Fay Weldon's script follows the original fairly literally, and the four hour production  covers the major events of the story, and manages to give an entertaining presentation to the faithful. David Rintoul, too, is a much better choice than Olivier (though of course, on the whole, a much more limited and less visible actor than the legendary Olivier). But in this one, he gives a perfect Darcy: tall, stately, stiff, uncomfortable, but melting with politeness once he has been chastised by Elizabeth's rejection of his suit. Their dramatic clash mid-way through the story is given very well, and the photographing of the moment when he delivers his letter of apology (and defiance) to Elizabeth is very well filmed--visually. Their meeting at Pemberley--the next most dramatic scene--is also done well, and both Garvie and Rintoul rise to the occasion there, as romantic lovers. And the climactic scene, when she accepts him, is done in quite understated way (as is in the book), but it works well, for Garvie has a soft voice that fits her confession and slight provocation of Darcy. He accepts her, and the whole thing is quite convincing.Pride and Prejudice, directed by Simon Langton; Andrew Davies, Screenwriter; Carl Davies, composerAs for the  A&E;/BBC production of 1996 (see above), it has much to recommend it, for it is a much longer and much more lavish production, with a more numerous cast, a spectacular music score by Carl Davies (based on Mozart's music), and choreographed dances of the numerous parties given during the lengthy story. It has a better Wickham, though not a better Mr. Collins. What I find a little objectionable in this production is the role of Darcy assigned to Colin Firth. There are pluses and minuses here. Firth is a much more dashing fellow than Rintoul, giving Darcy energy that the latter lacks. He is a passionate, involved, an almost reckless lover, scorched by Elizabeth's rejection. This production offers his point of view--through flashbacks and parallel editing giving his actions as they occur, something the novel of course does not do, for Austen's original story is told exclusively from Elizabeth's point of view, and Darcy remains somewhat of an enigma to the reader until the end of the story when we, and Elizabeth, really know who he is--a good, generous man, a fine master and brother. I don't know that the change of point of view matters to the viewer who does not know Austen's work, but it does change the characterization of both leads, and also creates an additional problem: it shows a Darcy far more interesting as a person and leading man than the object of his attentions--meaning the Elizabeth of this film. For the choice of Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth seems somewhat unfortunate. She is just adequate--and perhaps OK for a lesser production. She has the intelligence necessary for the character she plays and (though a born American) she has the right British accent. She is lively, but slightly shrewish, and a bit shrill at times. She lacks the ""weight"" and poise that this role demands. She smiles nicely, has nice teeth, and looks the part occasionally; but also scowls a bit too much,  throws tantrums when angry; something beneath the calm ""archness"" (word used by Austen) of the original character's mannerisms. Austen's Elizabeth Bennett is poised and her skills at repartee are quite well honed. In this sense, the character rendered by Greer Garson is of course superior.  The original Elizabeth delivers her darts with aplomb and a polish that Darcy admires, to the point that he falls in love with her wit rather than her looks--though he apparently is also captivated by her ""pair of fine eyes."" Jennifer Ehle does not possess the required fine looks--and her moments with Darcy are not well accentuated in a film that seeks to establish the romantic, rather than the satiric aspects of the story. It is odd that the magnificent Colin Firth (for he is that in this film) seems an overmatch for the persona created by Ms. Ehle, and maybe this is the drawback of this whole production. Quite enjoyable on the whole--but failing to connect most of the time. Only exception: the Pemberley scene, where Darcy and Elizabeth seem to have reached a well-tuned moment together. I wish I could give this a better review, because I have already seen it several times; Jane Austen has a way of inspiring--and a romance is a romance, especially one that has all the other production values mentioned."	4.0	Cmparatively Speaking	2013-02-20	0	0	0

I love and have always loved the film, which I believe is the best film production of Pride and Prejudice out there.  After years of watching on my battered VHS tapes, I switched to the DVD edition and was blown away.  The blu-ray edition was an exponential increase in quality.  They have gone back to the original negatives and completely rescanned, creating the best possible image quality given the type of film used.It's the same amazing story, but now you can see the texture of the fabric, the patterns in the flooring, the jaw-dropping beauty of Pemberly and the English countryside.  You will NOT regret buying this edition, I can't recommend it more.

We were very impressed by it and have watched it many times, but the original A&E; series was copied over VERY poorly to DVD as there are several places where the picture slightly washes out and/or the color fades.  At first we thought it was out television, but when we got a new flat screen TV, we noticed the same issues in the same places.As opposed to many Blu-Ray editions where the supplier has merely repackaged the same crap in the new media format in order to make a quick buck, the Pride and Prejudice Blu-Ray has been masterfully restored to not only rid the film of the above issues but also brighten the entire length of the movie.

We love that edition and have watched it on numerous occasions.  However, the difference between watching the Blu-ray version and the regular DVD is like the difference between real life and a grainy photograph.  The only thing I found a little cumbersome was when watching the whole series in one sitting, rather than having a brief pause between each episode (as the Special Edition DVD set has it) we are required to either watch or fast-forward through the introduction of each episode (theme music, credits, etc...).  But even with all that, it's still well worth it.As for the version starring Keira Knightley, I've watched it, but I can't stomach watching it again.  Ms. Knightley is no Miss Elizabeth Bennett.	5.0	Fantastic Classic	2012-11-13	4	4	0

It strays from the book quite a bit (I don't recall Darcy jumping in swamps nor even fencing) The acting is bland exept for Julia Sawalha, who is most melodramatic and Jennifer Ehle's smirking gets old quickly. The scenery is beautiful, however and so are the costumes.The 1979 BBC version, with a screenplay by Fay Weldon, is a far superior version.

But of all of them, I think this is absolutley the best of the best. I was always a big fan of the old Lawerence Olivier/Greer Garson version even though it is the wrong costumes(They used 1830's styles instead of the earlier period it should have been.)Olivier's Darcy was supperb. But after this version absolutly nothing can compare to Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as Darcy and Lizzie.So well done, so extremley faithful to the book, unlike the other versions of Austen's work. Even Sense and Sensibility is not this good folks. Although it runs a close second.The new edition is also worth getting, the color, sound and widscreen version is superb.

The costumes, sets and scenery are a visual feast. The screenplay and direction are just superb and the background music, what can I say, just fabulous but most of all the whole cast is perfectly put together and even the supporting characters acted very well indeed. Some of them may not look like the characters we have in mind but they acted their characters to parfection especially Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. I have seen other adaptation of PnP and they failed to capture the true character of Mr Darcy. Colin Firth showed every single emotions that Mr Darcy felt from the time he met Lizzy.No other Mr Darcy managed to convey the many different subtle emotional struggles of Mr Darcy that Jane Austen mentioned in her book. Colin Firth is the definitive Mr Darcy.This latest production of PnP is a must see. I was inspired to read the book after watching this excellent production. Now everytime I read the book the characters just come alive in my mind. The 1940 PnP movie is not close to the book at all but as a movie it is very entertaining. The 1980 adaptation is just plain awful, it bored me to tears. It is good as a stage play but as a movie Im not impressed.I would never be encouraged to read the book if I had seen the earlier version first.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2DRCJ1YOFTZKK	Dana	Great series, great actors... You could not go very wrong with an adaptation of such a classical masterpiece as P&amp;P, provided that you only follow the book, and this series does exactly that.Without delving too much on the plot and the excelent performances delivered by all actors, I'm just going to note a few differences from the book:1. There is a scene added while Lizzy is at Netherfield tending her sister, which shows Darcy watching her as she plays with a dog from an upper window. This is added to show how his interest in her is piqued.2. There is a scene added right before Lizzy meets Mr. Darcy at Pemberley, showing him training in duel and then taking a bath in the river by the house. I think those were added to show his state of mind and his inner struggle with his feelings. They were good and did nothing wrong to the character.3. The involment of Mr. Darcy in Lydia's wedding is shown as we go along, instead of Lizzy discovering it from her aunt's letter. I liked it better when it was all a surprise right up the moment she got the letter.4. The ending is a little rushed; after Lizzy and Darcy confess their love, we are taken almost directly to the wedding day. We don't see the scene where Lizzy tells her mother about the upcoming wedding, and that scene was great. Also, all the 'future' developments Ms. Austen suggests for the characters -- like Mr. Bennett constantly visiting his daughters, Lydia and Wickham coming to visit, Lydia's letters -- are not included.And two other things:The actress who plays Jane is not as beautiful as she should have been. She acts very well, however.Finally, I gave this DVD four stars not because of the movie -- which despite its flaws is a full 5 star -- but because it has no subtitles. Dialogue is one of the most important aspects in this movie, and with the old English phrasing it was sometimes dfficult to follow, because of the absence of the subtitles.	4.0	A very precise adaptation of the novel	2002-04-09	3	2	1

This adaption really brings the characters alive, and the sexual tension between Darcy and Elizabeth greatly depicted and very exciting.  If nothing else, Colin Firth is the most irresistable man in the whole world as the character of Mr. Darcy, and the film could very well be firmly carried by his performance alone.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A7S7OEMLBV0SU	Dan Huth	Pride and Prejudice is one of the world's Great Books. It's a timeless classic. But, this good and faithful BBC translation of Ms. Austen's vision gives us only good television. Good television is nothing to sneer at, of course; still, to experience the true genius of Pride and Prejudice you'll need to read the book.Perhaps the BBC have done the best that can be expected here. The acting, sets, costumes, screenplay, casting and music are pretty faultless--nonetheless, my viewing experience doesn't even approximate the intellectual &amp; emotional pleasures I receive while reading the book. I suspect that viewers who have praised this miniseries so highly are people who have already read the book, and who are adding their remembered reading experience to whatever is missing in the tv viewing experience. There is a pleasure in knowing what should happen next, what the characters should do and say, and then having it more or less come true; if it doesn't, exactly, because our mental images are always more ideal and fuzzier than reality, our disappointment is tempered as long as what we see on the screen doesn't actually ruin what we remember from reading the book.Jennifer Ehle is a lovely, smart actor; still, I am never convinced that her Lizzy is so very smart, funny, good and beautiful as to have shattered Mr. Darcy so thoroughly. Perhaps this adaptation's prime flaw is that it skimps on its portrayal of Miss Bennet's and Mr. Darcy's interactions at Rosings Park: in the novel, they spend much more time together than is shown here, so that his eventual proposal is better understood. At Pemberly, too, neither the full scope of Darcy's astonishing and obvious partiality to Miss Bennet, nor the Gardners' amazed reactions, are truly shown. Also neglected are the very funny, revealing conversations between the two lovers which follow their engagement in the novel, where Elizabeth explains to Darcy exactly why he loves her so much: these are some of Pride &amp; Prejudices best scenes, and their omission is barely tolerable.But, these objections (and others I've not mentioned) are by no means fatal flaws. This is very good television that sometimes rises to excellence; it's even better for someone who's read the book. Finally, though, had the book itself never been written--had this been an original screenplay--it could hardly be considered a work of genius. Still, I recommend it.	4.0	Miss Austen's Book Is a Masterpiece; This Adaptation Isn't	2002-03-30	5	4	1

I won't bore you with commentary on the film versus the book or any summaries.  I will say only this: if you have even the slightest interest whatsoever in buying this collection, YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST!  There is simply no imaginable way you will be disappointed by the purchase.  In fact, I think it nearly impossible for you not to be quite moved and so warmly touched by this incredible film.  Even if you've never read a Jane Austin book (I'm not an Austin fan, well, not yet) and have no interest in period films (I'm not even exactly sure when this story takes place), the fact that you've stumbled upon this page for whatever reason is justification enough TO BUY THIS FILM (I bought it)!

I am convinced that VHS still rocks! Case in point is to watch a VHS copy of Jesus Christ Superstar and then compare it to the DVD edition! The sound track in the digital version sucks! I have various VHS incarnations of JCS and they are different but soooo far exceeds the digital soundtrack on the DVD version! At anyrate this movie on VHS is amazing and as other reviewers suggests the colors on this analog version just look great granted the sharpness of a DVD or Blue-ray is lacking, however, there is still something to be treasured in the original VHS format! I am a musician and still record on analog tape so the sound quality of a movie to me is more than 50% of my enjoyment especially with soundtracks like this one! However, I would love to see the Blue-ray version as the cinematography is so excellent! Someone needs to design a mix digital video/analog sound format! LOL!!! All in all this is a great movie! The reason I thought this (I just figured out) is that it is ""very"" linguistly advanced! Also, it exposed all the false people in your life that can perhaps get your attention and even admiration until truth eventually gets exposed. But it is the researcher mind here in Lizzie that eventually figures it all out even when she finds here earlier assumptions were false and based on her screwy family upbringing especially her crazy mother who tries to manipulate the world around her constantly and a passive intellectual father who fortunsately does sometime see through the veil! Such an excellent flick! Got to get this one on Blue-ray though to see if the excellent cinematography surpasses my VHS copy and if sound quality passable! Lastly, There is a very elequent way here of telling people frankly what you think without having to couch anything or hold it all inside! So in this time you are allowed complete truth and honesty in your expression and if those you speak to are not evolved enough to get what you actual just said you still get to amuse those around you that do!

All of the characters are wonderfully portrayed to elicit a variety of emotions from the viewer, admiration and affection for Ms. Bennett, exasperation with her mother and younger sisters, scorn for Ms. Bingley, annoyance at Mr. Collins etc. etc.  However, it is the brooding, smoldering, intoxicating Mr. Darcy, played majestically by Colin Firth (there can never be any other actor in this role) that sets this 'film' apart from any and all others. His performance is exceptional and he dominates every scene he appears in and pervades those he does not. The evolution of the love affair between Mr. Darcy and Ms. Elizabeth Bennett is among the greatest love stories ever told. Both actors exceed all expectations in conveying their growing passion for each other, despite their initial objections.The ""long and longing looks"" scene in the music room at Pemberly has got to be one of the most romantic scenes ever caught on film.....enough to melt your heart and flame your own passions. The only disappointment is the truncated last scene when Mr. Darcy and Ms. Elizabeth Bennett finally kiss.......alas it must be left to our imaginations, just as Ms. Austen intended."	5.0	Worth it just to see Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy !!!	2005-11-09	9	7	2

The length of the film provides a leisurely study of the mores and customs of Jane Austin's time. It is faithful to the book - verbatim in many cases. All the performances are excellent; there is a depth of talent in the entire cast. The only flaw I've observed, after repeated viewings, is in the direction of Colin Firth's ""Darcy"". He does not appear to be burning with passion as he suggests. The attraction between Elizabeth and Darcy is palpable in the recent version starring Keira Knightly. Her performance compares favorably with that of Jennifer Ehle, whose 'Elizabeth' may never be equaled. The new film is too modern in language and careless with this classic. It is also too short to reflect Austen's times. Buy this treasure!"	5.0	A Classic Book Becomes a Film Classic	2007-01-03	0	0	0

I always joked about how strange my wife and her  mother must be for liking Pride &amp; Prejudice.

I took their advice, and bought the two tape set (all on two  tapes, instead of six) and figured I sit and enjoy watching it with my  wife.  I was pleasantly surprised that every thing that people said here  was right.  It was very enjoyable to watch.  The production was SO well  polished and the cast is wonderful.

I have had it on VHS(the 6 tape version), the first DVD release and now this release.  This release is highly superior in every way to the first DVD release.  The last release looked like it was copied directly onto DVD from the VHS tapes; the picture quality was not at all improved, there were no special features and the credits still ran at the beginning and ending of each of the original six episodes.  It was easier than dealing with six tapes, but otherwise a disappointment.  I'm so much happier with this one!  The picture quality is so much richer, there are only credits at the beginning and end of the entire movie and there are some very interesting special features.

Thomas ""Dave"""	After watching and loving the new version of Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley and Donald Sutherland, we were told that this previous BBC verion was actually better. The reasoning was simply that it was longer and the characters were more developed, and the star power represented in the film was comparable to the more recent version.We were quite disappointed. Practically nothing compares to the newer version, whatever the literary critics might say about their relative relationship to Austen's classic. Cinematographically, the newer version is simply superior. This includes artistic camera shots, costuming, sets, lighting, and pretty much anything else you can think of. The old version simply isn't nearly as pleasing to the eye. The same goes for casting. The actors' appearances go hand in glove with my description of other matters, and to be blunt, the acting isn't that good in the BBC version  (or if one desires a positive spin, it's better in the new one). In the end, the acting was not believable in the older version. Darcy's complexities, for example, are simply portrayed by a quizzical expression; his remarks about Lizzie, tone of voice, and expression are not romantically enigmatic, just confusing. Lizzie similarly is portrayed very oddly. Worst of all is Mrs. Bennett. The character is not annoying in a way that make you identify and sympathize with her beleaguered husband and daughters (as in the new), but in a way that makes you sympathize with anyone who has to sit through the actress's attempts at melodrama. Really horrible stuff!The fact is, the movie is too boring to sit through. Perhaps we were bored because we had been spoiled by the movie we knew so well. We tried to get through it, but finally gave up moved on to Trading Spaces or some cooking show.	3.0	Ho-hum	2006-07-22	26	4	22

I used to own this on laser disc. It was made for TV and came in a box set of six discs and, as far as I can recall, was formatted 4:3. In the new Blu-Ray edition, feet and the tops of heads are routinely chopped off. Because the costumes, sets, and scenery are among the joys of the 1995 version, this is a significant loss. The picture is, basically, magnified, revealing grain yet enhancing the faces of the actors. My only wish is that some sort of compromise formatting had been done, say, half-way between 16:9 and 4:3.That being stated up front, this 1995 British version of P&P; is THE one to watch and own.

Indeed, it's well worth viewing, and I will certainly watch it again (and again, and again), but I've seen other period pieces that I (personally) enjoy just THAT much more, and THOSE films I truly believe deserve a full 5 stars (and perhaps more).

After seeing Helen Fielding's comments on Mark Darcy being directly based upon Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy, I had to give it a viewing. While many of the period pieces I have watched over the years were dry and overacted, this one is a true gem. Upon renting it, I stayed up until 4 a.m. because I could not tear myself away. I have watched it five more times since and currently have the DVD on order so I can magically zap myself to my favorite scenes. Oustanding.All of the characters are beautifully portrayed and the cinematography brilliant. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle take my breath away. I feel like one of the Bennet sisters now.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A23HNJR2KLL26O	Deanna Breglia	Austen's stories are for women of every age.Elizabeth Bennett is easily one of the top ten female characters ever written. Her intelligence, strength, wit, and charm is admirable and timeless. My sisters, mother, grandmother, and I spent a long, enjoyable afternoon getting lost in the manners and morals of the 18th Century.Having recently seen the Keira Knightley version, I purchased the Special DVD (A&E;/BBC) version, eager to compare it to what I previously thought was one of the finest novel-to-screen adaptations. Yes, they're both well done, but this one is better.Jennifer Ehle is a wonderful Elizabeth Bennett and I echo the many who say that Colin Firth IS Mr. Darcy.I found the character of Jane, the eldest and described in the book as the most beautiful of the Bennett sisters, to be rather homely and not believable at all as the prettiest sister.I was a little disappointed that the Special DVD version (Full screen) seems narrowed and squished into the frame, giving the entire film an unnatural feel that I don't remember from viewing the BBC version on broadcast television.Yes, Austen's stories are written for and about women, but men who like a good, romantic, witty, period piece will enjoy this one, too. It's six hours, though, so prepare to not be able to pause it.	4.0	Oh Mr. Darcy	2006-01-07	11	9	2

I had to crank up the volume to the highest, so that would rate lower.  But the movie itself is unbelievably good and ranks more than five stars.The side characters are terrific.  Mr. Collins is hilariously servile, and Mrs. Bennet may be over the top but she's entertaining to watch.  Wickham may not be the most handsome, but the actor makes him so charming that Wickham's appeal is entirely believable (despite knowing from the book he's slime).  Mr. Bennet is exactly as Austen described--reserved, but with ""sarcastic humour"".  Miss Bingley is at her catty best.  Jane is wonderful--her own person, so different from Elizabeth but terrific in her own way.  She may not be the most gorgeous, as Jane was written, but the actress does brilliantly portraying Jane's sweet, good nature without making her saccharine.Lizzy and Charlotte's relationship is a bit underdeveloped--Lizzy saw her as a great confidante before her acceptance of Collins' proposal, and that doesn't quite come out.  (It's understandable, though, since Collins' proposal is fairly early in the story.)  Elizabeth and Jane's relationship is spectacular--they are friends as well as family.  Elizabeth and her father's relationship is a wonderful one, too, and it is quite easy to see how Elizabeth is her father's favorite.The miniseries does well in showing how both the Jane-Bingley marriage and the Elizabeth-Darcy marriages are successful however different they are--each marriage is a match of similar personalities.  Bingley looks so cutely disappointed in the scene where his sisters and Darcy are convincing him that Jane is not in love with him (with Darcy's voiceover in the letter).Darcy and Elizabeth are spectacular.  Firth does Darcy's proud haughtiness across without being entirely hateful, and he plays flustered well, too.  Elizabeth is truly the gentleman's daughter--she is proper and refined while being quick and clever within those social lines.  Ehle owns the language, and when it comes out of her mouth, it's like she's always spoken that way.  They smolder when they're onscreen--the restraint only cranks up the heat, when all they're doing is looking at each other occasionally.Normally something this long could drag at the beginning, but this one doesn't, and it only picks up speed towards the end.  It doesn't feel long at all.  Quite a tribute to the novel."	5.0	WOW.	2006-08-05	11	11	0

We have watched this video for at least 5 times and we would watch it 5 more times! We have memorized lines that we use in our daily  conversations and we try to encourage every acquaintance to view it.  Great for a ladies'  get together! Some gentlemen might rightfully enjoy watching it too, were  it not for the generous revealing of cleavages.  We highly recommend this  movie to anyone still impressed with the old-fashioned or classic values,  excellent and noble.  This does not serve just for entertainment, but also  as a guide for a lady in waiting, that is a lady who is determined to marry  the right person for the right reason: love. This shows how at last, a lady  and a gentleman who at first could not stand each other learn through a  series of events, to forgive and accept each other and also love each other  very deeply.  Truly a surprising way to find your soul mate. The entire  cast, including the mother, Mrs. Bennett a tiresome and fickle person, was  splendidly chosen. The acting was superb and very natural!!!!!!  I wish and  I hope that BBC will endeavor to create other such masterpieces like the  rest of Jane Austen's writings, with the exception of Sense &amp;  Sensibility which was already done and do not believe can be topped.  ALSO,  let me mention the music was outstanding and wonderfully corresponding with  each actor.  In other words, we knew, I mean we knew when the carriage  brought Mr. Collins or Lady Catherine De Borg!!!  Anyway, I could go on and  on....I mostly enjoyed Lizzy's role and if I were an actress I would love  to act her.  She was very dignified, very ladylike, charming but pure,  fiesty but sweet.	5.0	5 stars from 5 Texas sisters who watched it 5 times!!!	1999-09-05	1	1	0

When I heard this was available but only as a UK import (at that time it had not yet been released in the US) I ordered it immediately because I could not wait. I was blown away by the restoration. Many parts of the film are virtually perfect (on the top of the line 52 inch Sony LCD Bravia and OPPO Bluray player). Colors and detail are magnificent and really add to your enjoyment of this classic masterpiece. To be frank, I would have paid $100 for this. The whole thing is not perfect, you can see grain in places but it does not distract too much or take away from your enjoyment of the presentation. The only weird part is that scene at the end when they walk on the dirt path and it goes all washed out and blurry but that is not the fault of the Bluray but rather an artistic choice by the director to make it look dreamy and romantic. I would buy this all over again if they could find the original tape and fix that few seconds.Go buy this, it is one of the best productions of all time.

When the movie (mini-series) came on tv I decided to give it a try.  Normally movies do not live up to the books.  They do not stay true to the characters and it  nearly ruins the effect.  This movie floored me.  So what if it's five  hours long.  It has become one of my favorites.  My husband and I pull it  out on cold or rainy days and while away the hours with a movie in a class  with Gone With the Wind.  My children even love it.  It has some wonderful  Christian themes and portrays a time in history which I would very much  like to see more films of.

While it seems that Jane Austen's novel has been repeatedly re-made for film, to date there are none that capture the feel of the period nor possess the chemistry between characters as this version starring among many other greats, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. Although this film is not one of ""action and adventure"" as the modernized world would expect, it indeed is active with intellectual subtext and an engaging dialogue throughout. It is wonderful and in my opinion sets an example for current film producers that ""trash and dazzle"" need not be the standard! Indeed, there are many in the world that much prefer a well staged, well executed and engineered film - complete with the dramatic backdrops and ""in the moment feel"" that give the viewer the experience of society during this historical time period.

I am mystified by reviewers who are disappointed or fail to see the improvement.  The color is much better and the amount of detail that is visible on a normal flat screen tv is just miles ahead of the old VHS and the previous dvd versions.  I didn't think anything could make me like this film better than I already did, but this just opens up the visual elements of the film and makes it even richer.  The outdoor scenes are gorgeous and really show off the English countryside as I know it.  And the dramatic interiors, costuming and actors are clear and crisp.  There really is no downside to this new version and I kind of think that the occasional whingey reviews here are way off the mark.I also like the new ""extras"" but will certainly keep the old dvd because there are additional, totally different features on that version which are priceless."	5.0	Blu ray version is beautiful!	2010-11-19	2	2	0

Gundling	"Before i comment on this movie itself, be aware that there are many versions (from Green Garson's version to the one highlighted here to the  Kiera Knightly version that is the newest). Regarding formats, - there is a 2 DVD version which to me is the preferred format for this 6 hour movie (versus the 6 tapes or 6 DVD versions). Only reason to get the VHS tapes is if you don't have a DVD player.Regarding this story, I consider ""Pride and Prejudice"" the best of all the Jane Austen novels.  The story is uplifting and rich in character development. Rather than movies where events happen to the characters,  this is a movie that shows growth of the characters to become the best they can be.  This six hour movie is very true to the book in storyline, characters and dialog.  The newer 2 hour movie (starring Kiera Knightly) does not hold a candle to this 6 hour version.  You have to skip alot of storyline to go from a 6 hour version to a 2 hour version.  Secondly,  the newer 2 hr version had the heroine dressed in rags which is hard to imagine given that she is a gentleman's daughter.  The 6 hour version is pristine in every detail and you really know the characters and are vested in their happiness.  The costumes were spectacular, the scenes were beautiful.  It is a visionary feast.  If you like this movie by the way,  you will also like ""Wives and Daughters"" which reminded me of Pride and Prejudice in quality, visual beauty and uplifting story line."	5.0	The best of Jane Austin but be aware there also is a  2 DVD version	2014-02-21	0	0	0

I am definitely ""Old School"" and believe that when making a movie of a classic piece of literature the movie should try very hard to stay true to the book. The people who made this movie did not let me down. There were some changes made to the plot line in the movie, but they were minor, and in some cases I actually liked the changes, which I guess means that I think that movie makers were able to make improvements in their telling of Austen's story.I have always cherished the book of Pride and Prejudice, and now I have the movie version to cherish as well. It is so much fun to be able to see this beautiful story told visually. The costumes are excellent. The casting was superb. I cannot say enough good things about this movie.The DVD is great too because it has a featurette on the making of the movie and it was very interesting.Just for fun, I will mention the book and movie ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" the modernized telling of Pride and Prejudice.

I first saw it on A&amp;E a few years ago and loved it - instantly.  Now, that I own the DVD and can watch in in total (5 hrs!), I am even more a fan.  The language is, in my opinion, exquisite, as are the landscape and acting.  The manners and customs of people of this era have always fascinated me and the actors' portrayals are excellent.  When a character is to &quot;vex&quot; you, believe me, you are abundantly vexed. Colin Firth really brought Mr. Darcy to life for me as did Jennifer Ehle's portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet.

BUT, the director completely dropped the ball on one of the most important scenes in the entire series.  At the end, when they were walking along after having realized that they were in love, the problem was--they were walking along!  There was no eye contact.  The emotional impact of the scene was lost as they looked at the ground, at a moment when they should have been looking into each other's eyes with all the chemistry and passion that this couple possessed.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1G56KHOUOFWDW	"Dianne Foster ""Di"""	&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is one of the top 10 novels ever written.  The BBC miniseries with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is the finest adaptation to date. The actors are superb. The screen play is accurate,  comprehensive, parsimonious, and entertaining. The dialogue is beautiful  and preserves much of Jane Austin's witty and wry commentary. The  cinematography is superb. The film was shot in authentic locations all over  Britain.I thought the film adaptation by the BBC and A&amp;E was so  fine, I bought the VCR tapes when they were released, then I bought the  lazer disk version, and then I bought the DVD version. The DVD version is a  big fat disappointment. The quality of the DVD transfer is NOT good.First, the colors appear faded and with the Regency English palette of  beige-greens, browns, ambers, and taupes, this is a serious defect. It  makes the clothing look worn, the grass and trees look sunburned, and some  places, the complexions look downright washed out. The film appears to have  been shot in Arizona at high noon instead of England.Second, for some  bizarre reason, the DVD processors nipped and tucked some of the original  material. The clipped portions might not bother one who has never seen the  original--but I noticed. There was no need to edit this film. Four of the  50-minute sections are crammed on disk 1 (where the editing takes place)  and the other two were recorded on disk 2. I guess it would have made too  much sense to record three episodes on each disk?  Seems like poor planning  to me.For the price of this 2-disk DVD package, more care should have  been taken with the transfer process. My lazer disk version cost less,  holds more, and has beautiful resolution.	4.0	Not a high quality DVD...	2000-06-12	202	191	11

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A238ULCXMWN8RV	Digitlchic	After lots of confusion on which reviews were pertaining to the restored edition and which the original, I finally decided to just get it and I was NOT disappointed!  The film is amazing, and many will give details on that - this review pertains specifically to the technical changes in the restored edition.I was SHOCKED how many details were lost in the original version. Having worked in a photolab for over a decade and having a degree in photography I am very much of a color snob.  The quality (or lack thereof) in the original version was disappointing - the fact that I watched the movie time and time again speaks to how good the acting and film were to overcome the visual lack luster.I oooo'd and ahhhhhh'd in each scene seeing details with fresh eyes on the new version.  My biggest complaint is that sometimes the skin tones looked OVER saturated, causing people to look a bit on the red or orange side. But I would happily put up with that for all over the rest of the splendor the colors bring. The rooms in the houses truly look lush and rich - beautiful tones, not just beautiful shapes and textures.Truly worth the investment as this is by far still the best Pride & Prejudice available on film :)	5.0	Restored Edition was worth re-buying	2010-10-04	18	18	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2G6OS10YOK4IH	DisneyMom	First of all, this movie is fantastic, but I'm not going to review that. We already own the special edition DVD release and purchased the movie on blu-ray because the only thing better than all of that taffeta and lace is seeing it in excruciating detail. Unfortunately, despite the extensive restoration process, it is still clearly not up to blu-ray quality. Here are the pros and cons:pros: The color looks a lot better than the DVD release, and the detail is clearer. The 2 discs fit into a standard size blu-ray case, so it takes up less room than the DVDs.cons: There is only so much that they can do. There are still artifacts (albeit smaller than in the DVDs) which made me think we'd accidentally loaded a reel of film instead of a disc. Additionally, in the upconversion process, the images are sharper, but they're also really grainy. It felt like an upconverted DVD simply transfered in a different format, though in fairness, it's still better than a straight upconversion. This is an older film, so it will never look like the new movies that are being released on blu-ray.In short, don't have unrealistic expectations. This is an improvement, but it doesn't have the clarity of picture that you would typically expect from a blu-ray disc. If you're hoping for a more beautiful cinematographic experience with the story, maybe wait until the 2006 adaptation is released on blu-ray. The BBC version trumps in characterization & accuracy to the manuscript, but the picture quality still isn't there.	3.0	Review for BLU-RAY RELEASE-  improved, but disappointing	2009-04-17	5	2	3

I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't surround sound.If you are a Jane Austen fan, you will like this release. My wife watches this at least two or three times a year, and I confess I often watch it with her. It took me a while to get into the story, but the language is ""Shakespearesk"".

The costumes, countryside, dances, language, customs - all very well portrayed, as were the characters.  Besides all this, the story itself is a true classic tale of romance and relationships.  All without having to be tortured with profanity (cussing) and nudity which peppers so much of our modern Television and video movies.  It's shameful and obnoxious, what modern movie writers, producers, and editors collaborate together to make our stomachs turn - in the name of so called, 'entertainment!'  In my opinion, listening to profanity and watching nudity on TV, is NOT the least bit entertaining!This movie is clean, and suitable for older children.

I given this version 3 stars.1996: Given the luxious length, this version does develop  the characters very well, is true to Janes' book, is stellar in the use of manners of the day, major parts of the book are not missing including the best part of the whole series which is Janes' performance at Penberly on the piano - she and Mr. Darcy actually make love just looking at one another - yummy performance, and the English dialect is spoken throughout.  The Bingley sisters are present and a major part of the movie as well as Elizabeths' mother which is so excellently played!!

Having owned the VHS version a couple of years ago, I was very happy to see a vast improvement on the clarity &amp; quality of the movie.  Furthermore, I like the &quot;featurette&quot; of behind-the-scenes footage, showing the making of this mini-series. Excellent buy!  Too bad, however, that the &quot;featurette&quot; does not pay much heed to Jennifer Ehle ('Elizabeth Bennet').  She has done a wonderful job in the lead role, and without her, Colin Firth may have not quite worked as Mr. Darcy.  As is, however, they make a great on-screen pair.	5.0	Fabulous Addition to Any Collection	2002-04-01	4	4	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AMC0FZVFJ1E32	"""dramaqueen270"""	This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I could watch it a million times and still cry and never get sick of it. I watch it all the time and it still feels like the first. I always cry when Jane is trying to get over her love for Bingley, and always cringe when that stupid nit of a mother goes on about money. (You just want to smack her.) I always &quot;awwwww&quot; when Mr. Darcy says he made Wickham marry Lydia (That ungrateful wench) for Lizzie. I roll my eyes at Lydia, laugh at smiley Mr. Bingely, Scowl at Mr. Wickham, admire beautiful Elizabeth, and I just *looooove* Mr. Darcy!!The acting was superb. Really wonderful. The mother should win an oscar for most annoying actress. And those sisters...my god! How awful! And Lydia, that brat! But best of all were Jennifer Elhe (She is so pretty, she has such twinkling, merry eyes) And Colin Firth (So hot!!!). They all were superb.And the scenery! How accurate! I love the clothing, the sets, the language, everything. It's just so good I could DIE.I love this movie sooooo much. It's romantic, witty and just WONDERFUL!!! And the fact that its in six tapes makes me have my favorites. I like #3 and #6 the most. I like #3 because that's when Darcy confesses his love for Lizzie, but she refuses him because he is too proud. (But I can understand why, when he says she has bad connections and is going against everyone's wishes. Meanie.) I like #6 becasue it's the BEST ONE!!!!!! It's so sweet when they get married and Jane marries Bingley! Oh, it's just so good!And #2 was pretty good, you just want to Punch Mr. Collins, he is sooo annoying! I can see why Elizabeth refused him. But #6 is really the best because you just HAVE to hate Katharine DeBerg and love Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, and it's just such a wonderful movie.YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!!!!

The quality of this DVD is the worst I have ever seen and is much worse than watching the video through the home theatre system. I am surprised that the BBC allowed its release.  Of course I cannot return the DVD now that it has been opened but it is a complete waste of money because it is virtually unwatchable.

Colin Firth and Elizabeth Ehle set the standard for Darcy and Lizzy - they are perfection.  Matthew Macfadyen and Keira Knightley are the only other actors who have done so well.

I once owned the laser disc boxed set, and sold that when the full screen version became available on DVD. I have just watched the latest version on DVD and was so disappointed by its transfer, I was prompted to do a scene-for-scene comparison with the earlier DVD release. Opening titles are OK, but after that, the difference is astonishing. Some scenes have a green cast, otherwise the colours are generally washed out, with loss or degradation of flesh tones. There is also a general loss of detail. The aspect ratio appears to be 1.85, not 2.35, as stated on the cover. I hope the studio will do something about this and recall the product ASAP. Such a shame because this version of P&amp;P was an outstanding production, deserving to be collected and frequently enjoyed.	2.0	Great movie ruined by terrible transfer	2001-10-24	9	6	3
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2TXR85WQLE32N	D. S. Thurlow	"1996's BBC production of ""Pride and Prejudice"", starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett, is likely the standard dramatization of Jane Austen's romantic novel.  For viewers not addicted to Masterpiece Theater, its point of comparison is the 2005 theatrical release starring Matthew MacFadyen and Keira Knightley, which offsets a compressed version of the story with visually stunning production values and its attractive leading stars.The BBC version very closely follows the original novel.  It features a fascinating variety of detailed Regency settings and costumes.  The characters, including the Bennett family, are fully developed people.  Mr Bennett's patient patriach is in stark contrast to Mrs. Bennett's brashness and palpable desperation to marry off her five daughters.  Elizabeth's sister Mary, all but a cypher in the 2005 movie, is here fleshed out in priggish contrast to her flirtatious but foolish sister Lydia.  Mr Collins, the ordained cousin of the Bennetts, is repellently simpering, obsequious, and obnoxious, making Elizabeth's spinster friend Charlotte's decision to marry him for security a more difficult choice to swallow.  In contrast, Tom Hollander's Mr. Collins in the 2005 movie is more humorously inept than truly offensive.The real attraction of the BBC version is the slowly evolving relationship between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, here played out in great detail and with a delicious subtlety.  Jennifer Ehler's Elizabeth is older and visibly headstrong.  Her investment in her first impression of Mr. Darcy has an edge no doubt sharpened by the class distinctions that underlie Mr Darcy's initial objections to the Bennetts and to Elizabeth herself.  Colin Firth's Mr Darcy is less sure of himself and more vulnerable than Matthew MacFadyen's shy but competent take in the 2005 movie.  His interest in Elizabeth is visible earlier on, making his proposal of marriage to Elizabeth less of a surprise than Matthew MacFadyen's thunderclap announcement in the later movie.  The slow dance of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy toward a mutual understanding has the genuine push and pull of two strong-minded people.This BBC adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen.  Those whose introduction to this story was the 2005 movie will find the 1996 version to be a much fuller evocation of Jane Austen's enduring novel."	5.0	Pride and Prejudice as it was meant to be...	2008-02-11	9	8	1

Tucker	This is purely a review of the DVD version of the movie; of course I enthusiastically recommend this BBC adaptation of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, just as hundreds of others have done before me.Although I agree with other reviewers that there seems to be an issue with the colour (especially on the first of the two discs), I'd say it's easily adjusted on your television.  The DVD is much preferable to the video version.  I had the feeling when first watching the DVD that, thanks to the widescreen format, there is so much more scope.  Yesterday my sister and I conducted an informal experiment; we compared a scene in her video version to the same scene in the new DVD version.  It's very obvious that there is so much more in the picture on the DVD; one can truly appreciate how the director framed each shot, and it never seems that something is cut out (as it is in the video). I was also very impressed with the clarity; one can actually see the various textures of the fabrics, see individual leaves in the picture.  And as any true fan of the movie would agree, the ability to select and immediately jump to a specific scene is much better than fast forwarding through a video. Finally, some of the scenes are a bit different; the most notable is the wedding scene, when our hero looks at his intended during the ceremony. This never happens in the video version.	5.0	New DVD is much preferable to Video	2001-09-30	8	8	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AMNUGLHBHMFFH	"Duenwen Hsiao ""elena"""	A lot has been said about the main characters here.  I'd really like to say something about the not so important ones.  I rewatched this and the 80s version recently and was really struck by how differently Miss Bingley was portraid in respective adaptations.  In the 80s, she is all sweetness on top, but you can see that she's just simmering with jealousy and irritation underneath.  The book says that M. Bingley has a very stylish, elegant and fashionable air about her.  The 80s actress was superb at showing these trait.  I think she gave a very sublte performance.  M. Bingley of A&E; in my opinion fell short in so many respects. Yes, she was haughty and proud, but she was so awkward while walking, for example.  Did anyone notice, that she had a very vulgar way of looking at others, I'd say staring with her eyes practically bulging out...  She was not elegant or graceful in the least.  I think she kind of looked as if she was on [something].  Ok, I'm exagerating, but really, was she supposed to be so vulgar?  I think she showed minimal contrast between the character's ability to change from sweet to nasty and the ability to combine the two, which the 80s actress excelled at.Another character I'd like to comment on is Miss De Bourgh.  The A&E; looked like a [sick] person who is about to faint.  The make-up that was supposed to convey her sickness was too much.  She looked as if she was not in her right mind.Help!!! I'd dearly love to find a forum where P&P; versions are compared/contrasted, but cannot find it and this is not quite the place that would allow for discussion.PS:  I love both versions and the more they make the better.

Kira is lovely to look at in that production but she was not given the time to actually be the character Austen created.  The BBC/A&E version gives that time and does not overly fantasize the story.  It's absolutely a must buy for any Austen fan, and maybe for any Colin Firth at that.  Firth is just downright excellent in any role he takes on.  The best actor going these days, even better than Mr. Hanks if I may say so and it is saying a lot.	5.0	Very Good Perfromances and True to Book	2011-04-23	3	3	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ	"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"Of all the Jane Austen movies, the 1996 miniseries ""Pride and Prejudice"" is arguably the best and most detailed, as well as the most beloved.And even for newbies, this lush, gradual adaptation will unfold in a suitably interesting way, while remaining faithful to the original comedy of manners. It's graced with outstanding acting, Austen's sly wit intact, and a romantic story that never follows the ordinary mold -- sort of a thinking-girl's romance movie.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley (Crispin Bonham-Carter) moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to eldest Jane (Susannah Harker). But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie (Jennifer Ehle) immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth), who scorns the rural village and its inhabitants.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships arrive, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham (Adrian Lukis), who claims to have been horribly wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals the shocking secrets that Wickham won't tell her about his past behavior. Needless to say, her opinions of both men change instantly.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia (Julia Sawalha) elopes with Wickham, and lives with him without being married. For the time, very shocking. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie.It's obvious from the very first scenes -- when Lizzie jokingly comments that ""a man of good fortune MUST be in want of a wife"" -- that this is an adaptation that was done with love. The subplots, characters and atmosphere of ""Pride and Prejudice"" are all here, and there are no attempts at modernizing or changing a classic story.The plot unfolds slowly, one piece at a time, but with several subplots that twine together as the story progresses, like ivy vines on the side of an old country house. For a miniseries, it's actually rather spare and lacking in filler. And the dialogue -- based on Austen's -- is wonderfully well-written, with lots of sly humor woven in (""Beauty is not the only virtue. She has just inherited a fortune of ten thousand pounds, I understand..."" ""Now THAT is a definite virtue!"")The time period is recreated with loving detail, from the muddy roads to the sweeping mansions with elaborate grounds and gardens, and the gorgeously manicured exteriors of Pemberly. Even the hairstyles are recreated, unflattering as they sometimes are. And the entire plot is steeped in the mores of 19th-century England, with the attitudes toward marriage, love, and propriety that bound everyone ... especially all women.And the casting of the leads is absolutely perfect for this movie: Ehle and Firth are nothing short of astounding as Darcy and Lizzie Bennett. Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways. Firth's Darcy is a selfish, chilly man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Ehle's Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way, but too blinded by appearances. And neither will marry for anything but true love.They're also backed by an excellent supporting cast, with slimy clergy, screeching moms, sly seducers, sardonic fathers, innocent sisters and aristocratic old harpies adding colour to it all. Sawalha is especially good as the 19th-century Valley Girl, and Alison Steadman gives a grating but suitable performance as the whiny, marriage-obsessed Mrs. Bennett.""Pride and Prejudice"" is the cream of the Austen crop, and an understatedly romantic movie as well. Definitely to be watched, again and again."	5.0	His pride, her prejudice	2008-03-29	1	1	0

Richter	"Ever since first viewing the sumptuous BAFTA and Emmy Award - winning series Pride and Prejudice over a decade ago we have been addicted to it. With this reissue of it on Blu-ray it has to our great delight been restored to its pristine, colorful splendor.  The prodigious effort expended on the making of this series was truly a devoted labor of love lavished on one of the most engaging and affecting love stories ever created. In this connection we would recommend the comprehensive and enlightening account of it in The Making of Pride and Prejudice by Sue Birtwistle and Susie Conklin published by Penguin Books, BBC Books. Rather than being recorded on video in the studio as customary for TV productions this Series was filmed on location in Wiltshire and Derbyshire over a period of five months. Viewers' eyes are thus enabled to feast on beckoning vistas of the verdant English countryside providing an exhilarating and authentic backdrop for the whole story. The extensive and complex preparations required to mount such a vast undertaking are mind boggling. The book offers readers a comprehensive and fascinating account of the myriad details and requirements that had to be attended to, such as hunting for appropriate locations to represent Longbourn, Meryton, Netherfield, Hunsford Parsonage, Rosingspark, Pemberley and London; the endless negotiations to secure the availability of these locations, to cite just one example.This filmed series was the brain child of producer Sue Birtwistle and scriptwriter Andrew Davies, who promptly took her up on her initial proposal. In tackling such an ambitious project they and their dedicated collaborators were not about to do things by halves. Michael Wearing, Head of Drama/Serials at the BBC observed about this version of Pride and Prejudice ""that the idea of doing it wasn't executive led, didn't come from within the BBC, but came directly out of the passion of the people involved"", a passion that immediately drew in this viewer and swept him along from beginning to end.A convincing film adaptation of a literary masterpiece has to stand on its own feet as a genuinely new creation in its own right. Literal adaptations do not come off on film because lengthy narrations tend to become tedious and undramatic. As Andrew Davies has pointed out, these can be replaced by a ""show don't tell approach."" His adaptation of the story as script edited by Susan Conklin is masterful. The division of six installments totaling approximately 327 minutes allowed for the inclusion of all essential scenes. While some incidents and two concluding chapters of the novel were omitted they are partially made up for by specially invented scenes that bring the story to life and capture its spirit in a graphic way. Even so, Davies most effectively managed to include telling portions of original dialogue and letters at key momentsWe were so taken with this adaptation that it impelled us to pick up and read the original novel which, we are embarrassed to confess, we had never read. We frankly had not expected to be so captivated by a story told from a woman's' point of view. Indeed we found ourselves repeatedly rereading letters and dialogues, relishing them like relistening to favorite masterpieces of classical music.No cinematic adaptation can ever replace a classic novel, but at its best, it can provide a fresh and complementary perspective to it. In our own mind there has been formed a fertile symbiosis between this TV series and the original novel, the two reinforcing each other to make the original story even more seductive.Birtwistle and Davies succeeded in their aim to display the characters on screen as real people in all their physicality, to avoid merely presenting them as stilted historical figures. Although Darcy has been described by various commentators as an enigmatic character during the first half of the novel we did not find him deep down all that inscrutable in our reading. In spite of her judicious reticence in handling the male roles in her novels Jane Austen had a fine insight into the masculine psyche in our opinion. To make her story come off more effectively on screen, however, Davies wisely fleshed out the male characters, especially that of Darcy, by bringing to the fore his masculine physicality. We see him riding on horseback, taking fencing lessons and diving into a lake. The physical aspect of Elizabeth's playfulness and vivacity is displayed in scenes showing her jauntily swinging her bonnet as she is traipsing through the countryside. That Darcy's romantic sexual attraction to her is the motor of the story is graphically brought home in a cleverly invented scene showing him initially taking a tub bath and then, as he dries himself off, espying her from an upper story window making sport with a dog, totally unaware of being observed and how she is affecting him. Davies thus admits having pushed the story a bit more being about Elizabeth and Darcy, rather than just about Elizabeth. Nonetheless most of the action is still seen from her perspective.The background music composed and adapted by Carl Davis is a perfect fit to this filmed series. With the appearance on the screen of the floral embroidery preceding the first scene, it immediately sets a lively mood of eager anticipation, of exhilaration induced by the ambiance of refreshing country air and underneath it all one senses an electricity sparked by intrigues of hunting for prospective well situated husbands in tension with affairs of the heart. Throughout the film the music always appropriately reflects and reinforces as needed the prevailing mood of a particular scene. A capital instance is the unexpected arrival of the imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh's carriage at Longbourn, announced by regally ceremonious music in the Handelian manner of a French Overture. Especially noteworthy is the key moment when the music provides an added dimension by commenting in the manner of music dramas on the unarticulated and unseen significance of what is happening. Thus as Elizabeth and the Gardiners are wending their way towards Pemberley in the idyllic scenery of Derbyshire, soft music begins to gently insinuate a caressing intimation of budding romance as their carriage enters the woods of the estate with the stately mansion eventually coming into view. The unmistakable significance of that music becomes increasingly explicit as it is heard again while Elizabeth is viewing Darcy's portrait inside the mansion and near the end, as their romance attains full bloom after she accepts his second proposal during their walk together.Composer Davis' choice of small instrumental chamber ensembles in the style of the late 18th and early 19th century was most appropriate, his decision to incorporate the  fortepiano, the most fashionable instrument of the time, expertly played by Melvyn Tan, felicitous. His selections of authentic source music of that or the immediately preceding period being played,  sung or danced to by the characters on screen were apt in every case. The fastidious sensitivity with which he chose his selections is particularly evident during that magic scene at Pemberley in which Elizabeth, standing besides Georgiana playing the piano, espies Darcy adoringly staring at her and reciprocates with an empathetic amorous look. Preceding Georgiana, she had just accompanied herself singing Cherubino's aria, Voi che sapete che rosa &egrave; amor (You indeed know what love is) from Mozart's and Da Ponte's Le Nozze di Figaro, an unmistakable musical emblem for this particular scene as indeed for the story as a whole. Georgiana then takes over at the keyboard with Beethoven's ingratiating Andante favori, its soothing strains gently sounding the melting away of former disapprobation and dislike under the warmth of embracing, reconciling love. Mr. Davis has provided an interesting account in The Making of Pride and Prejudice of his work on this film including his choice of music, what he was trying to achieve, how he set about composing the score, the rehearsals and the task of synchronizing the music with the action on the screen.To our delight the film does justice to the important social function of longways dancing in this period and its specific role in this story. The dancing tunes heard during the dancing scene at Meryton are lively, those during the one at Netherfield more moderately paced, thereby highlighting the contrast between the boisterous social setting of one with the more elegant one of the other. Andrew Davies aptly characterizes the conversation between Darcy and Elizabeth at the Netherfield ball as ""almost like a fencing match caught in dance. It echoes a tango or a paso doble. There's a lot of stamping feet, they come together and they part, and some turns they make are like the turns of a matador. You get a sense of combat as well as dancing.""What, of course, clinched the extraordinary acclaim with which this filmed series of Pride and Prejudice was going to be received was the outstanding team of actors and actresses assembled for it under the brilliant direction of Simon Langton. Poor love stricken Hector Berlioz! After our initial viewing of this series we could for the first time truly identify with his becoming madly infatuated while witnessing performances by the Irish Shakespearean actress, Harriet Smithson. The fanciful image of her formed by his fevered imagination could hardly be taken as an authentic representation of the real person, but Classical Music lovers are forever indebted to him for having channeled his obsession into a flamboyant Symphonie Fantastique, wherein his beloved is treated as an ide&eacute; fixe,  symbolized by a haunting melody recurring in various guises. Alas, after pursuing his beloved actress for several years the extravagant expectation of his fantasy ran aground on the stubborn, disillusioning reality of the ensuing unhappy marriage to her! Yet that we are smitten with Jennifer Ehle's enchanting portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet we will not deny. With consummate artistry she captures every expressive nuance of Lizzy's varying reactions to the characters and situations she encounters throughout the story. Moreover she abundantly displays our heroine's defining traits: playfulness, an independent spirit, integrity, and, above all, a beguiling charm. Those ""fine eyes"", sparkling with mischievous wit, that much to Caroline Bingley's chagrin first irresistibly attracted the proud and aloof Darcy to her likewise cast their spell on us watching her on screen. Jane Austen confessed that she thought her heroine ""as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print."" With Jennifer's Ehle's impersonation of her she has as well become for us personally as delightful a creature as ever appeared on screen. During the fifteen years since her performance in this series for which she received the BAFTA Award for Best Actress she has been displaying the depth and breadth of her surpassing talent and artistry in a great variety of roles on stage in TV and  film, twice winning a Tony for Best Actress and garnering several other prestigious awards. While we don't expect ever having the chance to witness her in a live production on stage, we have in the meantime watched with pleasure every one of her other cinematic performances issued to date. But more about that another time.We owe Sue Birtwistle a debt of gratitude for refusing to take no for an answer when Colin Firth initially declined her offer for him to take on the role of Darcy. He proved to be the perfect  choice for it. In his portrayal of him one senses underneath his snobbish aloofness in the company of strangers a well disguised shyness and vulnerability. His innate reserve and proud demeanor seem to serve as a convenient facade shielding his passion for Elizabeth that he is trying in vain to resist. As he paces back and forth in the living room of Hunsford Lodge before making his first proposal to her, one suspects a chink of insecurity in the armor of his smug assurance that his demeaning offer of marriage would be gratefully accepted by her. When he receives his unexpected but well deserved comeuppance with her scathing rebuke of his arrogance and crushing rejection of his suit, one cannot help pitying him while beholding the expression of extreme vexation spread over her lovely countenance and her ""fine eyes"" blazing with indignation. This entire adrenaline charged scene hues quite faithfully to its visual description in the novel and Andrew Davies has retained the major portion of the original dialogue to great effect. It is superbly executed by both protagonists under Simon Langton's brilliant direction.The way the two play off each other is memorable throughout. Besides Davies' description, quoted earlier, of their dancing together at the Netherfield ball another fine example is their first tte &agrave; tte rencontre at Hunsford Lodge. Their body language marvelously conveys the pervading awkwardness of their interaction, her civility concealing her dislike of him and his reserve his smoldering passion for her. During their surprise encounter at Pemberley she fetchingly channels her discomfiture into an expression of bemused civility as she replies to his courteous enquiries about her family, his manifestly being ill at ease and inhibited tone of voice betraying a lingering romantic feeling for her. That magic scene, already commented on in connection with its accompanying music, was an inspired cinematic modification of Elizabeth's and the Gardiners' second visit at Pemberley as described in the novel. It further enhances in addition to brief earlier scenes Georgiana's role by showing her displaying her previously praised musical talent at the keyboard. More importantly that scene graphically answers the question Elizabeth had pondered in the novel during the preceding night, namely ""how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of [Darcy's] addresses."" The film brilliantly depicts how that power indeed fans the flames of his passion. After rebuffing Caroline Bingley's venting of her intense jealousy we see him standing alone leaning on the mantelpiece of a fireplace recollecting with his mind's eye Elizabeth's amorous look with a brief flashback to it, followed immediately by a shot showing him the following morning hurriedly getting dressed and galloping on his horse posthaste to see her at the Lampton Inn. The immediately following scene at the inn, faithfully adhering to its description in the novel, effectively brings home the poignant irony of the emotional bonding taking place between the two protagonists prompted by the very news that makes the prospect for any further contact between them seem hopeless,On their long walk together during which Darcy makes his second proposal, that wonderful extended dialogue in which they mutually sort out their past relationship was boiled down to its essentials in this cinematic adaptation. In the novel we read that Elizabeth's acceptance of Darcy's renewed offer produced a happiness ""such as he had probably never felt before."". We would not have minded a bit to linger in the bliss of that cinematically abbreviated scene, to vicariously dwell a while longer in the rapture of that happiness after all the frustrating vicissitudes of their past relationship. We would also have welcomed a scenic adaptation of the delightful chapter in which Elizabeth wants Darcy to account for his ever having fallen in love with her. It was probably deemed anticlimactic and one would suppose time constraints existing as well. Capping, on the other hand, the happy ending of this romantic tale with a solemn double wedding ceremony no doubt was considered cinematically de rigueur.In conclusion we should acknowledge the outstanding job of the main supporting cast. Susan Harker as Jane convincingly portrays her equanimity and good will toward everyone and acts as a convincing foil to the more high spirited and judgmental Elizabeth. Julia Sawalha plays Lydia to the hilt, just as she is described in the novel, ""untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy and fearless."" Alison Steadman faithfully and amusingly portrays with utmost conviction Mrs. Bennet in all her foolishness. The interaction between the sardonic Mr. Bennet, as played by Benjamin Whitman, and his favorite daughter is delightful and affecting. Crispin Bonham Carter as Bingley clearly exhibits his good manners, unaffected cheerfulness and all too ready complaisance, Anna Chancellor his sister Caroline's snobbish elegance, persistent officiousness and barely disguised jealousy. Adrian Lukis displays, as called for, Wickham's superficial gallantry and suave manner. David Bamber thoroughly succeeds in his role as the pompous, unctuous, sanctimonious sycophant, Mr. Collins. Lucy Scott convincingly comes across as the sober, easily contented Charlotte. Barbara Leigh Hunt does full justice to the character of the peremptory Catherine de Bourgh and her supercilious air. She is absolutely terrific in the confrontational garden scene with Elizabeth. The rest of the cast all rises to the occasion as called for.Incidentally the book, The Making of Pride and Prejudice recommended earlier, contains amusing and revealing vignettes by the principal actors and actresses relating their experiences during the filming of this series, a diary of a filming day, as well as an extended conversation with Colin Firth setting forth his insights into Darcy's character. As an added benefit the Blu-ray reissue of Pride and Prejudice also features a retrospective with interviews from Andrew Davies, costume designer, Dinah Collins and others as well as an account of the advanced technology used to painstakingly restore frame by frame the sumptuous colors and details of the original film.This splendid adaptation of Jane Austin's masterpiece has already become a cinematic classic the luster of which is not likely to fade. It will always remain a source of perennial delight for film aficionados. Speaking for ourselves we could watch it again and again just to indulge each time anew in cherished romantic fantasies."	5.0	An addictive cinematic classic	2009-12-08	10	7	3
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2R7RMWUXDJISH	ED Denson	"I am somewhat of an Austen fanatic, I suppose. I've read P&P;, and listened to my audio version repeatedly while driving - enough so that I can catch the audio saying ""a butler"" when the text says ""the butler."" I just finished watching the restored version of P&P; with all the extras. It is wonderful. Like all films the text has to be translated somewhat, as much of Austen's writing is either narrated, or internal thought processes. So we do not commence with Mrs. Bennet announcing that Netherfield has been let at last. We begin with Darcy and Bingley riding their horses near the Netherfield house, and Bingley asking Darcy if he should take it.  We set up Bingley's impetuosity and his dependence upon Darcy for more considered opinions - not that we do much with it later.  Anyway, it is no wonder that when this 6 hour specacular first appeared on British TV in the 1990s, it became an extraordinarily popular show (it appeared over 6 weeks). The casting is excellent. The production values magnificent and I'll be watching it repeatedly, I expect.I have one thing to note, and not just about this version of the novel. The characters all agree that Jane Bennet is the most beautiful girl around, ""there can not be two opinions about that"" but only in the Keira Knightly version of P&P; is it true. Here, because  Jane is not the female lead she is never better looking than Elizabeth . Jane is played well and I have no complaint about her actresss, but  I would like to see a Jane Bennet who is better looking than Elizabeth, just as she ought to be if our eyes are to agree with the characters in the film.The production here, and always,  is based around the idea that this is one of the greatest romances in the English language. Perhaps it is. Sex and Money say the producers. The book, however, is about an emerging enlightenment way of looking at life, personified by Elizabeth Bennet, who is a ""rational creature"" as she tells Mr. Collins, determined to act in the way that in her opinion will constitute her happiness, as she tells Lady Catherine.  She judges people by the content of their character, rather than their social position, wealth, or connections. And she examines evidence in just the way that we defense lawyers all wish our juries would - seeking the truth, rejecting hearsay, considering each sentence in Darcy's letter, weighing probabilities. None of her enlightened views  - the way of life she is modeling - are featured in any production I have seen. Perhaps we'll have to settle for the greatest romance in the English language - but the book is either so much more than that, or it is the greatest romance because of Elizabeth Bennet's enlightened way of living."	5.0	Almost The Best Pride and Prejudice Film Ever	2011-02-20	4	4	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1X587JJ51Y8J8	eeoyrefan	The admirable attempt of this film adaptation to remain true to the content and feel Jane Austin's enduring literary work cannot override the liability of lamentable casting.Of the primary characterizations, only Ehle as Elizabeth stands out.  Firth is sadly wasted as Darcy (especially so because he SHOULD have made a perfect Darcy) since he spends most of his  film time standing or stalking about broodily, and delivers what lines he has in an affected, stilted manner which lends nothing to the character.  Both the main players seem unconsciously to be imitating Garson and Olivier in the older adaptation of the film (which despite flaws of costume and a condensed storyline is a thousand times more enjoyable than this effort and should not be missed).  Firth even wears a pinkie signet ring like Olivier, and twists it distractedly in his discourses with Elizabeth in uncanny imitation of Sir Laurence.Perhaps the most ghastly casting error is Susahanna Harker as Jane.  While her acting skills are adequate, her appearance falls far short of the exceptional beauty required for the role; she puts one to mind of a blond, bug-eyed Mona Lisa, and unkind as it may seem this reviewer found it impossible to accept her in the role due primarily to her limited pulchritude.  In the same vein, the visage of Mary is also seems unnecessarily unattractive; in the first ballroom scene they either manufactured or left unconcealed a number of acne spots on the actress' face, which made me feel sorry for both the character and the actress.Also lamentable is the overacting done by Alison Steadman as Mrs. Bennet.  Her interpretation of the character is no more than an annoying stereotype.  One rolls their eyes when she appears on screen, and anxiously awaits her departure.Bonham-Carter is likable and effective as Mr. Bingley.  Also effective is Benjamin Whitrow as the pleasant but generally inaccessible Mr. Bennet, Adrian Lukis as the two-faced Wickham, David Bamber as the obsequious Mr. Collins, and Lucy Scott as an underachieving Charlotte.Beautiful countrysides, excellent efforts by supporting cast members and a consistently strong showing by Ms. Ehle, is in the end insufficient to incite enthusiasm for this adaptation.  (Curiously, the latest adaptation of Austin's work suffers an almost identical malady, except in THAT film it is Keira Knightly who is hopelessly under-utilized in the role of Elizabeth).	3.0	ZZZZZZZZZ...a good effort falls quite short	2006-04-24	24	3	21

I believe I have seen every one of them and none compares.  Laurence Olivier was great of course as Darcy, but Colin Firth has completely captured the character.  I doubt that any one will ever be able to portray Darcy better.I am extremely satified that I purchased the 10th Anniversary Collector's Edition even though I all ready had the original DVD of the same produecton. It is definitely well worth the price. I strongly recommend it to every one.  The DVDs come in a beautifully designed case, and I thoroughly enjoyed the accompanying behind-the-scenes disc.  Even though Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle were busy making other movies and could not be on it, the remaining cast members were very entertaining.  The accompanying book, ""The Making of Pride and Prejudice"" gave wonderful insights to the production. It is extremely well written and full of delightful pictures.  If you are a fan, even if you have never seen Pride and Prejudice--do not pass up this one.I do not understand the complaints submitted in several of the other reviews about the color of the film or it's not having subtitles. My 50"" television was set at the factory suggested controls, and the color in the DVD was superb!  The ""woods"" were so green and lush it made you feel as if you were actually there with Elizabeth.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3B03YYB7VE8L8	Elisabeth Kilmer	Both versions are worth watching, mainly for the contrast they provide. This will repeat other reviewers to some degree.BBC - Faithful to the book in lifestyle and pacing, and in the presentation of careful and restrained manners. Bennet sisters do look as though they belong together, though the Bingley sisters do not. But, and it's a big but: Many of the performances are wooden or shallow. Elizabeth lacks the wit and sparkle of the book, and says teasing lines seriously. Darcy tries so hard to be supercilious that he removes all life and intelligence from the character. Mrs. Bennet appears to walk on a stage and deliver memorized lines rather than inhabit her character, and she is fluffy and shallow rather than extremely silly (an interpretation which a viewer might prefer). Lydia never does anything embarassing or shocking till we are told she has run off. We don't see seriously egregious behavior from anyone that would offend Darcy. The best performances are the ones which are terribly flawed in the A&E; version: Caroline Bingley here is pretty, elegant, and very catty. Collins is perfect, exactly the combination of obsequiousness and self-importance Austen described. And Mary Bennet is also believable as a girl who is trying hard to be spiritual and elevated above her sisters. One other flaw: they added a lot of extra scenes with Charlotte Lucas/Collins which weren't really necessary and far more intrusive than the very small additions that A&E; did.A&E; - Very beautiful movie. Almost all of the secondary characters are over-played, but we felt that actually helped the viewer catch Austen's intentions, because a viewer has to apprehend the character without the advantage of going back to re-read. Collins and Caroline Bingley are really poorly done, injecting cartoon qualities that interrupt the flow of others' good acting. But this version has a big advantage in that all the actors threw themselves into their parts, and seem believable (except for the two above). We really prefer this interpretation of Elizabeth and Darcy, because while not overdone, they are understandable. She is witty, self-assured, and laughing at everyone. Darcy, a very difficult character to pull off, comes off much as Austen describes: haughty but intelligent, and fascinated by Elizabeth. And we forgive A&E; for having him swim on his own property in defiance of the book. So, in spite of the over-acting, we like the A& E version very much.	4.0	Comparison of A&E vs. BBC	2008-02-27	6	5	1

In different scenes throughtout the movie, the whiteness of the background was so bright you could hardly see the people's faces. The copy I got was a brand new still in the shrink wrap copy, so it was not the seller's fault - it was in the reproduction of the movie from the manufacturer.	4.0	Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition	2011-03-29	1	1	0

The only downside to the movie is that it is so long that it is definately a two-night deal.  Overall I prefer the casting in the newer version of Pride and Prejudice, but nobody can beat the haughtiness of Colin Firth.  Jennifer Ehle is wonderful, but in my opinion she is much prettier than the character Jane who is supposed to be the great beauty.  (Obviously it's not a drawback to the film, just an observation).  This is by far the best version of Pride and Prejudice.  I only wish that Judy Dench had played Lady Catherine De Bourg in this version as well.	5.0	Excellent Movie!!!	2008-05-02	1	1	0

When I watched this version, I kept an open mind, knowing that many movies do not do a book justice.  This adaption was superb, and was an utter joy to watch.  A few small aspects were left out, but it is already a 5 hour movie, and these changes do not alter the integrety of Jane Austen's classic story.  Not only was the adaption a delight, but the music, setting and actors came together to produce a seemless production in which any fan of the book would respect and enjoy.	5.0	A complete success, a joy to watch	2003-01-13	0	0	0

Jennifer Ehle is spectacular as Elizabeth Bennet, and Allison Steadman is ragingly funny as Mrs. Bennet. Also noteworthy are Mr. Collins and Mr. Darcy (played by Colin Firth). The BBC production faithfully follows the original novel, and is rich in historical detail. Jane Austen's story has always fascinated me, and every time I watch the BBC version, I can't wait to find out whether or not Elizabeth and Darcy will get together (although, of course, I already know). The costumes are fantastic, as is the dancing. This production is elegant and beautiful- just as a rendition of a Jane Austen novel should be.I received the 10th Anniversary editon as a Christmas gift, having been a longtime fan of the miniseries and Jane Austen in general. I especially liked the additional features of the new edition--the interviews this time around are much better, and the accompanying booklet is an in-depth look at the production of the miniseries--from original concept to post-production and broadcast.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A20TD5PADOEGFE	Elyse Wheeler	"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Most people would skip movies like that because they think they are too predictable or ""lame"", but I love them because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"". Pride and Prejudice was really quite clean. There are a few utterances of mild obscenity.  I can't remember if anyone is shown drinking wine.  There is no violence or nudity, but there are several low cut dresses.  It is also said that a girl of 15 runs away with a man she is not married to and are living together.  You see them together later in a room in London talking to each other and she is sitting on the bed. (They are later made to marry).  It is also said later that the same man tried to run away with another  15 year old girl, but her brother prevented it. The same man is seen with a woman in a corset and a long skirt, sitting on his lap for a few seconds and it is mentioned that he has gamboling debts.This is a story about Elizabeth Bennet and her family.  Elizabeth is 20 years old and is intelligent, lively, attractive and witty; however, she has a tendency to judge on first impression.  She is her father's favorite, very close to her elder sister Jane, and embarrassed by her mother and three youngest sisters displays in public.Her father, is a gentleman of modest income with five unmarried daughters, and therefore, his property can only pass to a male heir (their cousin, Mr. Collins), leaving his wife and daughters on their own when he dies.  His wife, Mrs. Bennet, is frivolous, excitable, and narrow-minded, and she imagines herself susceptible to attacks of tremors and palpitations. Her public manners and social climbing are embarrassing to Jane and Elizabeth. Her favorite daughter is the youngest, Lydia, who reminds her of herself when younger, though she values the beauty of the eldest, Jane. Her main ambition in life is to marry her daughters to wealthy men.The eldest daughter, Jane, is a sweet, shy and sensible, girl, but not as clever as Elizabeth.  She also only sees the good in others.  She falls in love with the rich Mr. Bingley, who moves to their neighborhood, and he falls in love with her.  However, his sisters and his closest friend, Mr. Darcy, think the Bennet's beneath them, because they have no wealth or connections.  Mr Darcy, aided by Elizabeth, eventually sees the error in his ways and is instrumental in bringing Jane and Bingley back together.Mary is the only plain Bennet sister.  She mostly reads and practices music, and thinks herself very wise and so tries to counsel the family.  Like her two younger sisters, Kitty and Lydia, she is seen as being silly by Mr Bennet.Kitty is the second youngest daughter, and the shadow of her younger sister, Lydia.  She always laughs or makes fun of whatever Lyida does and follows in her pursuits of the 'Officers' of the regiment.  She seems envious of what Lydia is allowed to do or have, and her father thinks her ""silly"".Lydia is the youngest and only 15.  She is spoiled, frivolous and headstrong, mostly because her mother never denies her and her father ignores her actions.  Her main enjoyment is socializing, especially flirting with the officers of the militia. Eventually, this leads to her elopement with George Wickham. Lydia shows no regard for the moral code of her society, and no remorse for the disgrace she causes her family. She is the first Bennet sister to marry, thanks to the help of Mr. Darcy being the one to discover them and paying to make their marriage happen.When Elizabeth's cousin, Mr. Collins (a clergyman), comes to visit to try and bridge the gap between their families (caused by him inheriting the estate instead of them) the family quickly learns that his plan is to marry one of the Bennet daughters. After being told by Mrs. Bennet that it is supposed that Jane will very soon be engaged, he turns all his attentions on Elizabeth.  Elizabeth finds him pompous, and lacking in common sense, and so rejects his marriage proposal.  Her father supports her in this (even though it would have benefited the family financially).  Mr. Collins then marries Elizabeth's friend, Charlotte Lucas, even though Charlotte doesn't love him.As the movie progresses, Elizabeth despises Mr. Darcy more and more.  He is handsome, tall, and intelligent, but rather antisocial; therefore, causing most to think him proud.  But by those that know him well, he is a trusted and true friend.  However, Elizabeth, falling for Wickham's charm and flattery, believes the stories he tells about how Darcy has wronged him.  She also finds out that Darcy was partly responsible for separating Jane and Mr. Bingley.  Therefore, when Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, telling her that by marrying her it would mean ignoring her rank, family and fortune and going against his families wishes and his ""own better judgement"" - she puts him in his place and tells him that because of his conceit, his arrogance, and his selfish disdain for the feelings of others, nothing could possibly have ever tempted her to accept him.Darcy and Elizabeth are forced to be in each other's company, causing both to see the other in a different light.  Not being able to get over the love he feels for Elizabeth and wanting her to have a better opinion of him, he tells her the truth about his dealings with Wickham and when he learns of Wickham running away with Elizabeth's sister, he does every thing in his power to fix the situation, so the family won't be ""ruined"" by the disgrace.  At the end, both overcome their differences (Darcy's pride and Elizabeth's prejudice) and judgments to fall in love with each other.  She realizes that she was wrong to judge him so quickly and he realized that he was brought up with correct principles, but was left to follow them in pride and conceit, and he would be still, it it weren't for Elizabeth.Overall, I love this movie and will definitely be watching it again and again."	5.0	Pride and Prejudice - will definately be watching again and again	2013-09-28	1	1	0

Nicholson	I've seen multiple versions of this classic from the Olivier Darcy to the MacFadyen Darcy. While Matthew MacFadyen is quite the hunky fellow, none can touch Firth for the combination of charm, elegance, animal magnetism and sheer acting genius. The dvd is a bit washed out in appearance and one must play a bit with the TV controls to get it just right but it is a small price to pay for this viewing experience. I am ever so glad the producers took the time to follow the book as closely as they did - to include two of Bingley's sisters, snapshots of Caroline Bingley's designs and hopes for Darcy's affections, Darcy's search for Wickham and Lydia in London, and so on. It lends completeness to the story that would otherwise have been lost. My sister and I both have copies of this particular version of the classic which will be permanent members of our viewing libraries. We even have backup copies in case the first ones wear out. To see this classic at its best, this would be the dvd to have.	4.0	The consummate version of P & P	2011-02-08	3	2	1
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A178OWW3HD7UYN	E. Niebel	Pride & Prejudice: Two MoviesJane Austen's novel, Pride & Prejudice, is set in rural, early nineteenth century England. It centers around Elizabeth Bennet, the second daughter of five. Though her family lives in what today seems a mansion, and her father is a gentleman, they are considered poor in the society in which they live. Mrs. Bennet seems to think of nothing but having her daughters married to the finest and richest men that she contrives to know of and meet. When two such men (jovial and friendly Mr. Bingly, and distant and proud Mr. Darcy) enter the community, the Bennet household is sent into an uproar of chatter and anticipation. Pride and prejudice on both sides, however, threaten to spoil the blossoming prospects.This adaptation of the classic was made in 1995, by A&E; and the BBC, with Colin Firth (as Mr. Darcy) and Jennifer Ehle (as Elizabeth Bennet). In this version, the photography is on a grand scale, with picturesque scenery. Many of the lines leap from the pages of the book, the story and its times are accurately depicted, and the acting is superb. Also not to be forgotten, is the beautiful, sometimes lively, sometimes serene, musical score, which sweeps the viewer into its mood.Taking a more modern approach, the 2005 adaptation casts Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy, and Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Bennet. It also stars Judi Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourg, aunt of Mr. Darcy. The photographic angles in this version were contemporary, as opposed to the traditional drawing room style of the BBC. This version takes much more liberty with the customs and propriety of the times (i.e. characters walking miles through the countryside in their nightclothes, or bursting into rooms with no announcement). All of the actors had big shoes to fill, but Knightly, Macfadyen, and Dench did a good job at casting new, and well-executed light on their characters (where the script allowed for it). Most of the other actors/characters, however, I don't think filled those shoes hardly at all. The costumes, music, and sets in this were all much shabbier than those in the 1995 version (the one on this page). I think this script would be difficult for a newcomer to the story to follow, especially regarding introduction of characters. Also, in trying to make the script different from other versions, the characters simply changed their minds, instead of growing and learning throughout the narrative, and the lessons of the story were lost for the most part.All this said, I prefer the 1995 adaptation, because: it adheres to the story and times; the music, landscape, and costumes are elegant; the acting (in my opinion) is superior.Pride & Prejudice	5.0	A Question of Superiority	2008-01-09	2	2	0

But then I saw this movie, and I thought, ""Oh.  I get it now.""  But then, I thought, ""Oh, probably they have changed it horribly from the book, because I don't remember the book being anything like this great.""  So I reread the book, and come to find out, the movie stayed extremely close to the book.  A lot of the dialogue even comes straight from the pages of Jane Austen.  I have seen several other movies based on Pride and Prejudice, but none of them come so close to the book as this one does, and none of them are nearly as great as this one is.  It's long, but to stay so close to the book, it needs to be this long, otherwise you wouldn't have a lot of the buildup to the final climax, and you would be left wondering why the characters chose to do what they did.  Another great thing about this movie, is that, unlike other movies based on classic books, this one is clean enough to watch with the whole family."	5.0	The movie that made me reread the book and get it this time!	2007-04-03	2	2	0

She is so lovely in this film and incredibly fun to watch.  I actually think Colin Firth outshines Laurence Olivier as Mr. Darcy.  Olivier lacked the dimensional intensity for the Darcy character which is how readers see him in Jane Austen's novel.  Firth plays him to absolute perfection so I would recommend this version over the black and white one any day.	5.0	Outstanding	2004-11-30	5	5	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2GA2SO3YK6CXI	"Esperanza Reynolds ""Hope Reynolds"""	"Born in Steventon, Hampshire in 1775, Jane Austen was one of two daughters of the Reverent George Austen and his wife Cassandra. She was educated in Oxford and in Southampton, finally attending a boarding school in the Abbey gatehouse in Reading, Berkshire. The environment provided by her home was conducive to writing and she often enacted plays for her family, something that gave her the opportunity to present her stories and develop the characters in depth.Jane Austen's works are imaginative, full of emotion and depicting relationships that transcend time. Jane Austen wrote about society, about propriety and about etiquette. She was highly critical of the snobbery with which the upper classes kept away from others. Her study of human flaws and prsonal relationships provide great material for the development of her characters.Jane Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice in 1813 and it still enchants audiences all over the world. The first time I read this book, I read as a child, back in Cuba, ""Orgullo y Prejuicio.""The writings of Jane Austen shaped my perception of true love as I identified with the love between Elizabeth Bennet and her one and only, Mr. Darcy. With this BBC adaptation completed in 1996, I have been able to relive the experience of exposing myself to a classic, one of the best books ever written. With this BBC miniseries we feel as though we were reading the book, for the adaptation faithfully follows the author's writing.The filming is magnificent, offering us a view of gorgeous scenery, magnificent castles, and locations that bring the book to life, for we can see what we expected after reading the book. The love story presents the struggle of the times, as two individuals fall in love, regardless of class differences, or status, and yet, the antagonism and friction created as a result of said differences. Darcy is a wealthy single man who, upon meeting the family of Elizabeth, boisterous, non-polished, and simple, believes her to be beneath him. The meet at a dance where his best friend falls in love with Elizabeth sister, but Darcy thinks he knows Jane's heart not to be true to these emotions. Elizabeth overhears a conversation during the dance and feels insulted by the proud and distant Darcy, keeping her distance and yet, without her awareness, falling in love with him. Jane Austen is masterful at creating enough tension to keep us all in suspense as to the path these lives will take as some members of Elizabeth family make the wrong choices.The dialogue is almost verbatim to the book, making this series a true delight for those of us who identify with this work. Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth and Colin Firth as Darcy provide magnificent interpretations of this timeless classic, keeping us all dreaming of ever encountering love of this magnitude in our lives. As with most DVDs that we own, we watch by selecting English subtitles, which enhances the viewing by allowing us NOT to miss a single word said by the characters. Who would want to miss a single word in this marvel of the English language? There is a documentary as an additional bonus, where interviews with cast members are included... simply awesome! Interviewed are:  Jennifer Ehle [Elizabeth], Colin Firth [Darcy]. We also get to see those who played Mary Bennet [Lucy Briers], Mr. Collins [David Bamber, Mr. Bingley [Crispin Bonham-Carter] and Mr. Wickham [Adrian Lukis]."	5.0	Considered a classic, one of the best ever written books of the world	2007-04-09	9	9	0

(I lived in England)  I have to say it is one of those dramas that I will watch and watch and watch again.  I love the characters and I think that the casting is one of the best. Jane Austen of course must be given the credit of a great story.  But I commend the adaptation and staying true to the book.  I read the novel after watching the film and was amazed by how well it stuck to the story.  I love the settings and the views but I am an English country girl at heart so I would.

I mention it because I read the other reviews before purchasing and almost didn't purchase it because of one review that wrote scathing criticism of the color.The complexions are lighter than in the TV production that I taped when it first aired but in my opinion that is in keeping with the 19th century ideal of a creamy white complexion for ladies.  Any lady with any color was considered common and not a lady.The color on the costums and in every other aspect is quite good.This widescreeen, anamorphic version adds a great deal to my enjoyment and it is now possible to get a look at more of the spectacular detail put into this production.The additional footage answers some of my questions about minor characters which provides more clarity and realism.This is the very first DVD that I purchased with my new DVD player and it was first because my own taped version was wearing out and no longer pleasant to watch because it had been played so many times.I never tire of watching this movie because of the wonderful character studys and the humor along with the story.

The BBC's television production of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennett, and Andrew Davies as the screenwriter is hands down the best retelling of Jane Austin's beloved story, even today. But it is most impressive on the Blu-ray format. The lavish English countryside landscapes come alive in brilliant colors and Mr. Darcy is even more handsome in high definition. I have seen this version of the P&P; many, many times on DVD and it was very good in anamorphic widescreen, but each time I watch it on Blu-ray, It's like I am seeing it for the first time, with the characters and beautiful scenary so vividly reproduced.

There is the look of ""The World is absurd, and I am quietly laughing"" often on the heroine's face, and you get a much better feel of the characters as the people that Jane Austen was laughing at.

Even the size of the ""balls"", which were much smaller than what people raised on modern wedding receptions in vast spaces often think of, made me enjoy the little details.I ended up doing things like really looking at the costuming - I had not realized that having the tops and bottoms not match was part of the style.So even though I own more than one movie, I like this so much better!"	5.0	It adds so many of the little details missing from movies	2012-04-12	2	2	0

I set aside the perfect moment and the perfect time so that I could indulge in all six volumes back to back. I had recently read the book and was quite excited to see it acted out. Much to my dismay the movie was a bit dull and in some instances hard to follow. Had I not read the book, I would not have had a clear understanding of some of the scenes. Overall, the movie contained many many elements of the book, but perhaps my expectations were simply too high.  I did not find Jennifer Ehle particularly convincing as Elizabeth Darcy. She made annoying faces and appeared considerably older than her implicit age of around 20. It's worth watching, but it's not as intriguing as I had hoped. Maybe I will find another version of the book more to my liking.	2.0	Disappointed Viewer	2005-05-29	21	4	17

This 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is simply outstanding.  It excell in essentially every aspect.  It is faithful to the book and the sincerity to the time and place is geniunely thought out.  The costume, sets and scenery are exquiisite, it is a visual feast.  The music is absolutely superb.  The choreography is outstanding.The whole cast has a class I had never seen before, the characters are perfectly put togerher, they come alive in a way that I have not seen equalled by any other production.  From the main stars all the way down to the most menial of the servants.Some characters may not look like what you have in mind but everyone did their part extremely well.  Although Jennifer Ehle in my opinion looks a bit heavy, in physical sense, for the part of Lizzy who was described as having a light and pleasing figure, she captured the spirit of Miss Elizabeth Bennet to perfection.  Susanah Harker as Jane I think is not five times prettier than the rest but she is wonderful as the sweet and good natured Jane Bennet.  The rest of the cast I believe pretty much look how they should look.Colin Firth as Mr Darcy, what can I say, no one admitted to the priveledge of watching him could think anything wanting. He is spot on as Mr DarcyThe entire film is full of excitement and drama, the wit and humour of Jane Austen really shines, it is truly a sparkling comedy of manners with a spice  of passion and romance.  The scenes that are supposed to be powerful and dramatic are passionately and perfectly portrayed.  The whole cast delivered their lines and acted their parts with feelings and intelligence.At last, a film has finally done justice to one of  the greatest love stories in literature.	5.0	Best Ever	2005-04-15	5	5	0

I have tortured so many of my friends and family by making them watch it -- they have all ended up loving it, even the guys.  But Colin Firth, what can I say?  Wow!  One reviewer noted that Darcy seems stiff and not very impressive on the first viewing but then after you have watched the movie several times you notice that his subtle facial expressions mean so much.  This is so true!  Colin Firth can say pages of dialogue without ever opening his mouth just through slight smirks and looks of adoration from his eyes.  You know he's falling in love with Lizzie from the second time they meet just by the way he looks at her.  Lizzie is such an amazing character who is witty and strong all at the same time.  My favorite line in the movie is when Lizzie is being confronted by Lady Catherine about the rumored engagement between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy in which Lizzie states, &quot;He is a gentleman, I am a gentleman's daughter, thus far we are equals.&quot;  I just want to stand up and cheer everytime I watch.  I highly recommend this miniseries!  If I had to pick only one movie to have the rest of my life, this would be it without hesitation! One other note -- Lizzie's father's dialogue is some of the funniest and truest to human nature of anything I've heard.Also, if you enjoy Colin Firth as much as I do, I would also recommend &quot;Brigdet Jones' Diary.&quot;	5.0	Oh, Mr. Darcy!	2002-12-01	10	9	1

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	ALJC8CJS54GO3	Fitzwilliam	The Storyline:Elizabeth Bennet is the heroine of this early 1800's English novel by Jane Austen.  She comes from a middle-class family composed of her father (intelligent though overly complacent), her mother (a very foolish woman), and four sisters (Jane, Mary, Kitty and Lydia). Jane, the eldest is the beauty of the family. She is also sweet natured, modestly intelligent and too willing (according to Elizabeth) to see the good in every person or situation. Elizabeth is second eldest. She is very pretty also, highly intelligent and views the world and its inhabitants in something closer to their true light. Elizabeth's younger sisters, like their mother are all very foolish in their various ways. Thus all of the grace and wit of the Bennet family is clustered within the father and two oldest daughters.Mr. Darcy is the hero of the story. He is a man of good character, very intelligent, handsome and wealthy. But Mr. Darcy suffers from a misplaced pride in his position and is lacking in some of the social graces.  Elizabeth Bennet suffers from a different disability. She has extremely high standards and is easily prejudiced to disapproval when faced with those who apparently fall short. According to Mr. Darcy, her 'good opinion is seldom granted'.  Elizabeth is temporarily attracted to the 'amiable' but evil Wickham who 'has all the appearance of goodness', but in who's character she was easily deceived.  Gradually however, the two lovers find each other and we are presented with the expected happy ending when Darcy and Elizabeth, and Jane and Mr. Bingley, Darcy's excellent and also quite wealthy friend are married. Oh joy!The production:Simply fantastic!  Virtually all of the performers are truly excellent.  Lady Catherine (a somewhat minor character I know) is very special, especially in the 'prettyish kind of a little wilderness' scene at Elizabeth's home.  Although the performers in the 1980 version with Elizabeth Garvie seem to be somewhat more attractive overall, their acting skills don't in general measure up to those in this production.  I think Jennifer Ehle made a fine Lizzie and for those Garvie fans out there, I agree that she is also wonderful (I especially like her singing in that version).  If we were to replace the Elizabeth and Jane characters in the BBC production with Garvie and Jane from the 1980 version that would probably work very well also.I must mention the horses.  For me the sounds of the horses and the countryside scenes with carriages rolling across tree-shaded culverts in the woods are a great addition to the production.  And the gallops in the fields.  And Lizzie wandering in the field with horses grazing nearby.  Just wonderful. ....The DVD:This review is of the full-screen DVD version ...I was fortunate with this purchase since the full-screen version is now somewhat rare and sells on the used market for exorbitant prices.)  Picture quality is excellent!  Sound quality is good although in some of the quiet, conversational scenes I notice a background hum or buzz.  It's not a problem for me but might be for those with a better ear and more exotic sound systems.  A friend purchased the P&P; DVD recently (the widescreen version) and doesn't like hers as well.  The 2.35:1 aspect ratio is not appealing on ordinary size TV's and there may be some loss of color also.	5.0	One of my favorite video experiences	2002-04-04	4	4	0

I'll say again: this was a 90s television miniseries!!!  Thank God it was filmed; ""I, Claudius"" will never look so good from having been created on videotape, and none of the 90s Trek shows will ever make a grand an entrance on Blu Ray, as they were made on film but edited on standard definition video (the effects all made on video, too).Those in charge of this restoration and transfer should get medals.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1YKTGDWITQPM2	Frank J. Perricone	I am not a Jane Austen fan and didn't watch this; I bought it as a Christmas present for my wife.  So I can't speak to the quality of the production beyond the usual second-hand comments about it being perhaps the best filmed version of this book.However, I'm posting a review anyway because there's one important observation I can make.  There are a lot of reviews on the old DVD version of this movie that commented on how the colors were washed out, the sound muddy, and the video quality on the whole was worse than VHS.  When I ordered this, there were no reviews for the Blu-ray version, so I couldn't tell if it would have the same problems.I can safely say it does not.  The video is crisp, the colors true to life, the images strong and compelling.  The sound is also rock-solid.  It doesn't take a lot of advantage of Dolby surround, of course, but what can you do?  But the remaster from BBC's original video was done with all the care to quality that apparently the DVD remaster completely lacked.	5.0	Video quality is excellent	2010-03-14	7	7	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A213PL2AVFGL18	Frank Lewis	If you are like me, you expect to drop your dvd in the player and, voila!  Showtime.  But bad luck here.  Everything was squished and NO widescreen.  Needless to say, I was upset.  So I did a brief search on the net and came up with the answer to this problem.  I needed to change the settings on my dvd player so that it would recognize the type of television I own.  If you find yourself having similar difficulty I point you to a site called TheDigitalBits.com, look for an article titled, &quot;The Big Squeeze&quot;, concerning anamorphic widescreen.If you haven't seen the film already, enjoy!  If you have already seen this miniseries, some of you may recognize that this 2001 edition of the dvd includes several brief scenes that did not appear during the prime-time airings on A&amp;E, but you would have seen them if you caught the hour-length episodes on &quot;A&amp;E In The Classroom&quot; about 4-5 years ago.	5.0	Great miniseries, but where's the widescreen?	2001-09-29	4	4	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1OZFMJ2AD2R41	Furiae	"I loved the A&E; production of Pride and Prejudice.  The cast was perfect, it brought the characters I loved from the book alive, and as I wrote in my VHS review, my husband (a military man who wouldn't be caught dead watching a period film about marriage and without guns, grisly deaths, and explosions) sat through this from beginning to end in one sitting.  By the 4th tape, he was yelling at me to pop the next tape in; thus is the power of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  Now, I have my brother- a 16 year old gamer who's never read a piece of classical literature of his own will- to add to that list of people who thought they'd never like it, but in the end, couldn't wait to see if Elizabeth and Darcy get together!I won't bore with the details, since so many people here have so very deservingly praised this production.  So, instead of reviewing the acting, performances, and the production in general, I'll be contributing a review about the special edition DVD's quality.Color quality is really lacking.  They aren't unbearable or intolerable, but noticable if you've seen the VHS.  I'm not saying it's just a little noticable, it's very noticable.  The VHS offered a warm and rich viewing of P&P;, something I miss while watching the DVD.  It isn't, however, unbearable.  It's not ghastly to the point where people are the same color as the walls (like I've heard some people say).  I'm a P&P; nut, so I'll still choose my VHS set over the DVD when I want to just sit down and enjoy P&P-; if you love the lovely flushed, warm faces of the VHS and the broadcast (especially the rosey cheeks of Jennifer Ehle), then stick with the VHS.  Everybody looks very fair (read: pale) in the DVD.  Other reviewers aren't kidding when they say colors are washed out.  Lighter colored clothes all sort of blend into the same sort of off-white color.  You see the most drastic gap in quality between the VHS and the DVD when you compare the Bingley sisters and Lady Catherine, who all wear vibrant colored silks.  On the DVD, their clothes are nothing but a shade of what it was on the VHS.Worse off than the color is the contrast.  Some things (like Darcy's hat when he steps out of the carriage with the Bingleys and Hursts) have no outline or definition if it's dark on dark backgrounds.The worst, I think, is the blurring.  On this transfer there are a LOT of motion artifacts.  Grass blurs when shots are panning, backgrounds blur even when people move in some shots!  This, I can safely say, was not a problem on the VHS, but it's a big problem on the DVD.  (Again, not ghastly to the point where you can't watch it, but definitely noticable.)Some people like to nitpick every little problem, and will make a situation out of nothing.  I'm sorry to say the complaints lodged against the special edition DVD release of P&P; weren't made by such people, and, rather, made by sound and sane consumers.  But it isn't so bad to the point where it's unwatchable or too detracting (unless you must absolutely have the best, best, best!).Though I love my (now ever more precious) VHS set, the changing of tapes and rewinding gets tiresome.  What the DVD offered was relief from the opening, the credits, the rewinding, the forwarding, and the getting up and changing of tapes.  The special features were nice, but nothing spectacular.  Only a few secondary characters are interviewed (only Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennett, and perhaps one other secondary character, I believe), but none of the lead characters, which was very, very disappointing.  I was hoping for a glimpse of Jennifer Ehle or the actresses who play Jane, Charlotte, and Lydia out of their period costumes, but, alas, that didn't happen.I'm glad it's widescreen, I'm glad it's in DVD format, I'm glad I only need to get up and change the disc once, but I'm definitely disappointed with the transfer quality.  I'm waiting for a re-release that will do the series justice.  It's just an awful, awful shame, but still decent enough... for now.  These complaints are all superflous, however, and centered around the quality of the release itself.  The genius of Austen, the charm of the story, and the liveliness and talent of the cast are still fully captured and well presented in this edition... just a teensy bit blurrier and whiter than usual!EDIT:ADDED:DISCUSSION ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ""10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION"" AND THE ""SPECIAL EDITION.""The 10th Anniversary Edition release of Pride and Prejudice is essentially the same as the original special edition DVD set with a few added extras.  The extras are: The Making of Pride and Prejudice book and an additional third bonus disc.Now, if you already own the first DVD release, the big question is, ""is the 10th anniversary edition worth buying?""  Well, the only thing that is exclusive to the ""10th..."" edition is the third bonus disc, which includes interviews with the producer, composer, and the actors who played Mary Bennett, Mr. Bennett, Mrs. Bennett, Mr. Wickham, Mr. Collins, and Mr. Bingley.  There is definitely some good stuff in the interviews, and the bonuses go into a lot of aspects of production, including wardrobe, food, casting, music, and the balls.  Unfortunately, neither of the leads (Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth) participated.The book, on the other hand, can be purchased separately.  It is titled ""The Making of Pride and Prejudice,"" written by Sue Birtwistle and Susie Conklin--Amazon carries it in stock.  Therefore, whether or not the set is worth the repurchase relies entirely upon the appeal of the bonus disc.  Being an avid fan myself, I had to have it (I also have the VHS set).  I don't regret the purchase, myself, because the interviews reveal a lot about backstage antics that occurred during filming.  However, if you're a casual fan who isn't interested in repurchasing the entire movie, it may be better to just consider the book.This is a fantastic option for people who haven't bought the special edition set (the first DVD release).  I would definitely, definitely recommend the ""10th..."" set over the other simply because you get more for your money--the book and bonus disc are a bargain for the extra $12 (the book itself sells for $14!).  The bonuses that were included on the original DVD set are still there on the ""10th..."" edition, so you're not missing out on anything.The cons, however, are:- The flaws that I discuss in my original review about the first DVD set are still there.  Like I said, this is essentially a re-release of the original DVDs.  Thus, the color and contrast is still inferior to the original VHS release, and the issue with the motion artifacts (blurring) is still present.  Film quality has not improved since the first DVD release.- Packaging is a problem.  The DVDs are slid into cardboard sleeves, which makes me nervous whenever I slide them out because I'm afraid of scratching them.  For an ultra-special edition, packaging the discs in sleeves seems cheap.  The size of the slipcase is huge compared to other DVD cases, which can be a problem to fit on media shelves.  It basically is the size of the book, which comes tucked inside the slipcase.  However, though it's big, it does make a handsome present.  (I guess what I'm saying is that it's impressive to gift, but potentially annoying if you're the one who has to find a way to store it.)All in all, I'm not wowed by this set, but I certainly don't regret the purchase; though, I should add that I didn't already have the book.  (However, if you already own the book as well as the first DVD release, I would recommend thinking twice before plunking down the money for, essentially, just the bonus disc.)  This would make a lovely gift for people who don't already own the miniseries, and is definitely the recommended choice for first-time purchasers."	3.0	"Excellent Production- Poor Transfer Quality / Added: Diff. between ""10th Anniversary"" and Special Edition DVDs"	2004-01-12	57	54	3

An elegant production. Some fine work by the cast, excepting Mrs Bennett who irritated me in a way that wasn't quite as Austen intended.

I have yet to see an adaptation that is entirely to the letter, but this one comes very close.  Well done all around, a production that was clearly done with care and affection for the source material.  The mini series format allowed the film makers to present the novel fully, as Austen wrote it (unlike the disasterous Northanger Abbey film, which is riddled with crippling cuts).The widescreen presentation is quite welcome.  The only quibble I have is that the picture quality is somewhat less than spectacular - the film is from 1995, but the grain makes it look as if it was from 1965.  Mind you, it is tolerable, but notiecable even on a small television.  This quite surprised me - hopefully a special edition that is actually special will be released that addresses this problem.  Hence my four star rating of a five star film.	4.0	A stylish adaptation	2004-10-23	9	8	1

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3AQR6B0M38VLI	Glenwaverley	I missed all the hoohah when this was first aired in the late nineties due to my postgraduate exams. Finally when things settled down, I borrowed this from the local video shop. To my amazement I watched the 4 part miniseries in 1 sitting! Then watched it all again the next day! It was Darcy-mania!Out of all the different large and small screen adaptations, this one captures the essence and in my opinion, is the closest rendition of the the Jane Austen novel. I believed this role of Darcy catapulted Colin Firth to superstardom and earned him the reputation as the thinking woman's sex symbol. To me, he is the ultimate Darcy. Move over Laurence Olivier, Matthew MacFadyen, David Rintoul, fine performance but still just acting.The bubbly piano music, the costumes, the cast were just superb. Andrew Davies did a great job creating this champagne lightness and upbeat style shows again that he is a master of BBC costume dramas.Of course I bought my own copy plus 3 more to give to my female friends, who I believe we're all infatuated with Colin Firth, even the 70 year old retired grandmother.	5.0	Benchmark BBC Drama	2013-08-07	0	0	0

Yes, Lizzy loved the outdoors & she loved walking, but the jogging thing would have been unladylike & she understood propriety.The actress who played Jane, while pretty in a classical way, was hardly the beauty described by Austen.  Mrs. Bennett's portrayal was screechy & over the top.  Lydia's was a little overdone, too.  Darcy's taking a dip in the pond at Pemberly was just stupid (& I am so grateful that Firth refused to cooperate with their misguided intention to make it a skinny-dipping scene).  The list goes on, but it's actually not the point of my review.  Suffice it to say, my first viewing of this edition was not enthusiastic.Then, after watching the 1980 BBC version & turning it off in disgust (too much of the story was changed & Rintoul's Darcy was painfully stiff & unappealing), I decided to try this one again & just accept the flaws & overlook them.  To my surprise, everytime I see this version I love it more!It was quite faithfully adapted from Austen's book, & for the most part, the changes made for the script stayed true to the book in spirit.  Yes, Ehle's jogging still sets my teeth on edge & she still was not quite so light & light-hearted as Lizzy, nor was Colin Firth's portrayal of Darcy flawless.  BUT they are both excellent actors & did such a masterful job with what they had!  And I seriously doubt that anyone will ever be able to surpass Firth's portrayal of Darcy - he conveyed so much emotion with just the expression of his eyes!Having now seen all 4 versions (1940, 1980, 1996 & 2005) thru our local library, THIS alone is the version that I have decided is a must have for my personal library!

The dialogue from the book was painstakingly created with brilliant characterization from the actors.I've seen the famous Sir Lawrence Olivier play Mr. Darcy but (I hate to admit this) his portrayal pales in comparison to Colin Firth's.  Perhaps it was the superior handling of the material or the excellent directing; nevertheless, every nuance and change in Mr. Darcy's character is captured eloquently by Firth. Jennifer Ehle was also a delight as Elizabeth Bennett. She gave life to the wit and fire of Lizzie.I highly recommend this dvd.  Of my family and friends who've seen it they all loved it.

In the movie Collins comes across simply as a pompous fool, here he is also smarmy and downright malevolent, visiting the Bennetts just to gloat over their misfortune, to get even for his humiliation by Lizzy's rejection of him.Benjamin Whitrow is excellent as Mr. Bennett: he has some of the best lines, funny and likeable (the scene where he approves of Lizzy's rejection of Collins is far better acted than Donald Sutherland's performance), but also too partial to his own convenience to guard his family's good reputation.The studied and the spontaneous rudeness of the upper nobility (Miss Bingley, Lady Catherine) and the landed gentry (especially Mrs. Bennett) did not come through in the movie. Here Miss Bingley is a veritable bore (well-acted by Anna Chancellor) who cannot offer anything but gossip and insult in the way of conversation and is pathetically obsessed with Darcy's feelings about Elizabeth. Based on the movie I was not aware just how embarrassing Lizzie's family was, with Mrs. Bennett's desperate hunt for rich men and continuous rewriting of events so that she comes out right at the center of it all.Indeed, this miniseries is a more faithful adaptation of the original story. It is, however, much less beautiful and, at least for me, less intense. The most passionate moment in the entire miniseries is Darcy's first proposal, delivered in such self-disgust that it forbids any compassion for the strength of his feelings (""hope it will pass soon, if it inconveniences you so bad"" is indeed the appropriate reaction). If I remember right, when I read the book, I was able to experience both feelings - the strength of his passion and the enormity of his pride, one evoking compassion, the other resistance.If this miniseries errs on the side of propriety, with a cold Darcy who seems to soften a bit toward the end and an Elizabeth who doesn't seem to feel quite so much for him, the movie errs on the side of passion that manners can barely contain. I enjoyed the intricate story and subtle characterization of the miniseries, but the spontaneous feelings that manners cannot contain touched me more in the movie. I would recommend both, to everybody according to their taste. The former is perhaps more true to the original, the latter is my preference. The perfect adaptation would strike the balance between propriety and passion further toward passion than in the miniseries and further toward propriety than in the movie."	4.0	Intricate and funny, more proper than passionate	2006-04-02	15	13	2

Every time I watch it I pick up some nuance I hadn't seen before. My favorite scene is the dance where Darcy and Lizzy match wits as well as steps. Make no mistake: this is a fairly complex dance that would have most non-professional dancers counting under their breaths today. Yet Darcy's and Lizzy's verbal fencing cause the dance to seem effortless. I challenge viewers to match similar wit and grace today. That Ehle and Firth can achieve this as Lizzy and Darcy speaks volumes of their own abilities.Yes, it's not a perfect adaptation of the novel, but it's a great holiday from today's concerns for five hours.I've been wanting to get the DVD version of P&P;, but if it's going to be just as washed out as my VHS version or worse, I might wait until they re-release the regular edition. I wish A&E; had not compromised on quality and called it a 'special edition.'

Ventura ""GHV"""	"This is the third version of the book a have seen so I know I'm probably tainted from the first two which I loved including mostly the casting of the characters.  Your first version of a character tends to be the one that becomes the benchmark in your mind. (I.e. Try to picture anyone else in these roles:  Brando in The Godfather, Hanks in Forest Gump, Gable and Leigh in Gone with the Wind, Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca, etc)  The Kiera Knightley version is excellent and well cast.  Rosamond Pike as the eldest daughter and Keira Knightly (perhaps even too pretty if you know the book) were PERFECT in the version as was Matthew Macfayen as MR. Darcy and the rest of the cast.  The third sister Mary is not quite the ""outcast"" as in the two TV versions and is perhaps to nice looking but they didn't have time in the Motion Picture version to get into all the characters, like some of the faults the Mr. Bennet has, although I enjoyed Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett very much.  But for true fans of the book you may want more of the great story so I happened upon a BBC TV version which was much longer and therefore told the story more completely and it was also very well cast  (Except the even too already ridiculous Mr. Collins). The second version I saw delved more deeply into the characters and the story and the cast although not Ms. Pike and Ms. Knightly in looks were excellent and so was Mr. Darcy.  I actually liked the actresses who played Lady Catherine de Bourg and especially Mrs. Gardiner (who took her to Mr. Darcy's home) even better than the motion picture castings, but again having more time for the character helps.  Having said all this, although the 1996 version is the most extensive for fans of the story and IS well acted I just did not like the casting of Lizzy, Jane, and Mr. Darcy very much and the whole I did not enjoy it as much as the first two.  However if you have no preconceived ideas of the characters beyond the book you may like it more than I.  As far a production it did exceed the BBC version which almost felt like you were watching a true English live play especially in the indoor scenes shot with very few cameras.  (Which actually once you got used to it had it's charm as well)."	4.0	Longest and closest to the book	2007-08-13	6	2	4

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A306FUC47K76V7	Guy Fleegman	The BBC's production of &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice,&quot; starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, is one of the finest television mini-series ever made.  It was released during the Jane Austen adaptation craze of the early- to mid-nineties.  In terms of quality and entertainment value, it bests most of the theatrically released Austen adaptations of the past decade, with the sole exception probably being Ang Lee's &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (from Emma Thompson's screenplay).UNFORTUNATELY, this DVD edition is so poorly produced that first-time viewers may find this 5-star production anything but.  &quot;Enigma,&quot; another English production, was initially released in a similarly execrable DVD edition, then later re-released with a far, far superior transfer.  One can only hope this will happen for &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice.&quot;  For one, the video appears to be converted from PAL, the European video standard.  The colors are horrifically washed out; the series now looks like it was shot in 1963.  There is also some very obvious video artifacting and compression; the series needed another disc to maximize picture quality.  Quite disappointing.Despite the DVD's drawbacks, &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; is still a wonderful retelling of Austen's masterpiece, with consistently excellent performances from the entire cast.  (Jennifer Ehle, interestingly, is not British.)  On this DVD, however, it is now much less sumptuous -- hence the three stars.	3.0	Polite People Speaking With English Accents	2004-05-17	12	7	5

The dvds are not as bad quality as an old VHS but not up to standards as a DVD. IMO, Colin Firth makes up for this.This is my favorite on screen adaptation of Jane Austen's novels. I have been sorely disappointed with others, save for the 1995 version of Sense and Sensibility, with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. (I HATE the recent P&P; movie with Keira Knightly - I have absolutely no respect for her after that movie. In plainest words, she was HORRIBLE.)In this production, a few things were slightly changed but overall stayed true to the novel a lot better than I could have imagined. I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewer who said this can be watched over and over again. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle just pull you in head first into the story.One thing I really don't like about this dvd set - no subtitles! I hate dvds not having subtitles. It's hard to understand what's being said because I am not used to British accents and especially when everyone is speaking softly.  Sometimes my tv makes up for it and add captions on but otherwise I have to rewind and listen again to some parts of the movie.The colors are a bit washed out which I don't mind because it adds to the story which takes place in another era.  It sets the mood for me because I am not seeing everything vibrantly.  I think it psychologically works better because it creates the atmosphere necessary to recreate an ""old world charm.""  If that doesn't work for you, just readjust the colors of your tv.FYI - I am referring to the edition that was released in 2001 NOT the new version.  The newer version is apparently digitally remastered and both versions of this dvd display the same reviews."	4.0	Love this Production	2006-10-23	8	6	2

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2GPN2VKS8E77C	HAMLET	"11 years ago, the BBC (British Broadcasting Company) produced this elaborate version of Jane Austen's classic novel. Though I'm very fond of period pieces, I confess I had a lot of""Prejudice"" (pun intended; if Jane Austen, rolling in her grave, will forgive me) against seeing this production, due to my intense disappointment at their previous stage productions of""William Shakespeare's The Tragedie Of Macbeth"" and the horrible""William Shakespeare's The Tragedie Of Antony And Cleopatra."" The aforementioned productions starred Jeremy Brett (""My Fair Lady"") as Macbeth; former James Bond (""The Living Daylights,""""Licence To Kill,"" ""Disney's The Rocketeer"" and Franc Roddam'sTV remake of ""Cleopatra"") and Lynn Redgrave (Vanessa's sister) as, respectively, Antony and Cleopatra. My ""Prejudice"" was further augmented by the incredulity of anyone (unless it were Kenneth Branagh) attempting to take on a role made famous by Sir Laurence Olivier in the 1940 film version (please see my reviews on all of their films; quite excellent movies, they are). My apprehensions were quite unneccessary. Colin Firth (""Shakespeare In Love,"" the ""Bridget Jones"" movies) made the role his own. Having read the novel several times before viewing the 1940 film, I was quite familiar with the classic story (also having viewed ""Mansfield Park"" and ""Sense & Sensibility""; the two of these being equally elegant films; please see my reviews on those wonderful productions). Obviously, the intended audience is mature older teens and adults (those who don't consider the study of classic literature or the prospect of a 3 hour movie""F---ing boring""). I now have only to see the version made last year starring the lovely Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet, Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet and Academy Award winner Dame Judi Dench (""Shakespeare In Love"") as Lady Catherine De Bourgh. I highly recommend all three film versions of the classic love story for all high school English classes, beginning with the 1940 film, followed by this masterpiece and concluding with the 2005 film version.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1T8NG9MG8A47Q	Hannah Goodman	Pride and Prejudice was first introduced to me through my mum. After reading the book I was delighted to discover the DVD existed, which I knew I definitely had to watch. The DVD was absolutely amazing; it brought each character to life as the cast portray the characters magnificently! Jennifer Ehle's acting was outstanding as Elizabeth Bennet and I grew to love her to bits.  Colin Firth was a brilliant Mr Darcy and he enabled me to understand the depth of Darcy's character. Alison Steadman played Mrs Bennet remarkably well. Mrs Bennet's character is at times trying, as she is so fickle, yet Alison Steadman brought life into the character and made me laugh many times. Over all I absolutely love the story. It seems to contain everything a good novel needs and I thank the people who brought this masterpiece to our screens.I often think films based on books miss the true meanings found in the book, however; this DVD captures everything that makes Pride and Prejudice a fantastic read today. It's a DVD that must be watched if you're a Jane Austin fan.	5.0	absolutly superb!	2004-02-09	3	3	0

Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are absolutely perfect in every way as Elizabeth Bennett and Mark Darcy.  This is six hours long, but so addictive that Austen fans will be grateful for every second.  Don't bother with other versions.  Hollywood's 1940 version is ghastly, just like nails on a chalkboard to Austen fans, although the Mr. Bennett isn't too bad in that.  The 1980's PBS version isn't good, but, fortunately, very forgettable.  The only strong point of that version is the depiction of Mrs. Bennett, presenting her in a kindly and realistic light.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AUUH6Z8MSGGF	Haunted Flower	"Pride & Prejudice BBC Review7 Part Mini-Series on 2 DiscsThis complete remastered edition will be released Tuesday, April 24th.""Pride and Prejudice"" was a 1995 Emmy Award-Winning BBC mini-series that runs about six hours long. Wonderfully done, but I do not recommend watching it all in one sitting as I had to do! This Jane Austen story examines the prejudices between classes in the 19th century and the pride that keeps lovers apart. It is an epic journey of romance, very gradual, no love at first sight here but a lot more realistic perspective on how affection develops and true love forms set in a time of manners and period dress and culture.Fifteen years later, this adaptation of the Jane Austen novel still holds up very well. Set in the first decade of the 19th century, it has an authentic look and feel in set, costumes, and manners. More impressively, the characters are able to take these complicated, beautifully written but difficult to say lines and present them with a bit of a modern tone for today's audiences to understand them.The remastered picture and sound greatly improves the presentation of this miniseries. I only caught one or two scenes that had difficulties because of lighting or being inside a carriage that couldn't switch over as well, but if you are a fan of this series or of Jane Austen stories at all, you need to have this set. It explores so thoroughly the story and captures many exact lines from the book without leaving anything out.There is no doubt how much Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy made a huge impact on his career, even to the point of reprising the role somewhat as Mark Darcy in ""Bridget Jone's Diary"" based off ""Pride & Prejudice."" Tall, dark, handsome, mysterious, and decidedly grumpy, Firth's Mr. Darcy hits all the marks for a gradual character change. First he plays Elizabeth's perception of him for about the first half and then when her view of him changes, suddenly he is a little more open and forthcoming with goodwill.Elizabeth Bennett is the most energetic and stubborn of her family and vows only to marry for love and not for money or status. Having five sisters puts their family at a disadvantage and all of her mother's attention is devoted to trying to marry them off. It is a classic story that most people are familiar with and can still emphasize with and relate to because of wonderful adaptations from the book like this one. Jennifer Ehle's performance is wonderfully proper and fiesty when she needs to be showing all the restraint and passion simultaneously that she can muster.I do enjoy the more recent version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" with Kiera Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen made 10 years after the BBC version because it speeds up some events and cuts it down to a more manageable running time of 127 minutes easier to do in one sitting compared to this version's 300 minutes. However what the 1995 version excels at is details and is more accurate to the book which die hard fans will love and find important. After all, I much prefer the ""Lord of the Rings"" extended editions of those movies because I love the story so much and adding in all those extras makes the time fly for me.My end conclusion is that this version of the story is divine for the fans out there and you should definitely pick this up for how reasonable the price is. I also recommend checking out the 2005 film of this story and 1995's ""Sense and Sensibility"" that came out soon after ""Pride and Prejudice"" that year.DVD Extras:""Lasting Impressions"" - This feature with a running time of a full hour talks about the impact of the 1995 adaptation of ""Pride & Prejudice"" which took a modern pace and contemporary delivery to appeal to today's audience. The people interviewed for this documentary were producer Sue Birtwistle, Benjamin Whitrow who played Mr. Bennett, Alison Steadman who played Mrs. Bennett, Crispin Bonham-Carter who played Mr. Bingley, Adrian Lukis who played Wickham, and Lucy Briers who played Mary Bennett. Alison Steadman and Lucy Briers are both much more attractive women in real life! The filming of the 22 week shoot is discussed such as the order of events and how certain actors were cast. For example, the proposal scene between Darcy and Elizabeth took place VERY early and would make or break the entire story. Bingley had to learn how to ride horse and Mary barely knew how to play piano and both had to practice quite a bit. Many of the actors talk about their first scene of filming and usually it was a pretty emotional scene that they were thrown into. The actors talk about the lack of makeup people wore in those times and how Mary was just set up with some greasy hair and a bit of powder thrown across her face while her sisters were all being beautified around her. A great challenge separating the classes like the Bennett House which looks grand on its own had to pale in comparison to all the other houses in appearance. There had to be substantial differences in class in costume material and meals like giant slabs of meat. This feature is a great exploration into the making of the film and getting to hear from the supporting actors about the process, the only thing missing is Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.An impromptu walkabout with Adrian Lukis (Wickham) and Lucy Briers (Mary) is the two actors walking about the Bennett home ten years later talking about their experience. It is mostly the two of them just chatting it up on what it would have been like if their two characters had gotten together and Colin Firth supposedly calls Lukis on the phone for a few minutes. There is also a feature on the technical restoration process and what a complicated detail-driven lengthy process it is. It includes a few of those voila! moments of before and after like you see in Blu-Ray commercials to show the difference in quality.Pride & Prejudice: A Turning Point for Period Drama - Andrew Davies, the screenwriter focused on the men to get them into the story since it mostly dwells with the women. Some extra opinions that chime in agree that Colin Firth just IS Mr. Darcy in a lot of ways for a lot of people. They also praise Jennifer Ehle as a ""proper actress"" and the benefits of her performance. This feature talks more about how the script was adapted and how the costumes were created and designs. This is another lengthy feature clocking in at 31 minutes."	5.0	This remastered edition is a MUST for the die-hard P&P fan!	2010-04-26	14	14	0

Every thought involved into making this movie can be clearly see to try and compliment the magnificence of the book and also reflects more on what is correct for the Regent time period.

Then when it first came out i didn't watch it because i am not a fan of period dramas, it wasn't until i watched Bridget Jones diary, that my mind changed.  I fell in love with Mark Darcy and heard he was based upon Mr Darcy of pride and prejudice so i set out to watch it.(mark darcy is definatly just a morden clothed Darcy)It was truly fantastic, i watched it all in one go ( a mighty 6 hours!!)  Whilst watching i remmebered the book, and to my surprise there were many parts of the book in this adaptaion.  Colin Firths portryal of Mr Darcy was truly amazing, i didn't fully understand his character when i read the book, but he seemed clearer and deeper in this film.  Colin Firhts eyes did just as much acting as the rest of his body put together...But, apart from Darcy (the reason i watched it) the other characters were truly marvellous, and superbly casted.A brilliant film, and i am proof that anybody can enjoy this.	5.0	Colin Frith...fantastic!	2001-05-05	4	4	0

It was mainly talking by the producer and writer about the pre-production (which you can read about in the book). I felt there should have been a lot more than what I got.The colour also looks a bit...strange - washed out and the like, unlike the video version which had much stronger period colours. The sound is a bit muffled and not as good as the video version as well which was disappointing.Having written that, the quality is good for the series. Colin Firth is dreamy as Mr Darcy and Jennifer Ehle is great as Elizabeth.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A364VIQ3KLAWVX	H. M Pyles	"Jane Austen once described her work as the painting of small pictures with a very fine brush.  Small they might have been, as they did not take on the great issues of the epoch.  But, in painting her small pictures of the types of people that attracted, bemused and annoyed her and her family, Austen created a series of exquisite masterpieces depicting the coarse currents of passion and pettiness that perpetually run just below the surface of whatever veneers of gentility and custom society creates.  With her very small brush, she pushed aside mountains of Regency refinement to peer with both loving humor and sharp critique at the foibles of human nature that lay beneath.Her plots are simple affairs, inherently entertaining, and relatively easy to turn into a good two-hour movie.  But to grasp just how much there is in any Austen novel, one has merely to look at how many good -- yet utterly different -- films can be wrested from a single novel.  Take ""Emma"", for example.  It has yielded a delightful romp starring Gwyneth Paltrow, which focused on the comedic elements of the novel.  It has yielded a darker and more substantive film with Kate Beckinsdale's portrayal of a young woman whose English class-consciousness brought her very near a capacity to injure that was not in her nature.  And it has yielded Amy Heckerling's brilliant take on modern L.A. life in ""Clueless"".What this A&E; version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" attempts to do is mount a single production that distills all the elements of an Austen novel into one film.  It's a stupendous task, and the fact that it is done so credibly here makes this effort a masterpiece in its own right.Everything falls perfectly into place.  From the slightly-tatty Bennett establishment to the grandiose de Burgh estate, the settings capture the range of lifestyles encompassed in Regency England by the broad concept of gentility that, in fact, glossed over a huge array of social striations that posed one barrier after another to any aspirations for social mobility . . . or to the pursuit of natural attractions between young people.The casting is very strong, starting with a superb Jennifer Ehle as Miss Elizabeth Bennett, the young woman to whom the tasks fall of making her silly mother endurable, her ineffectual father responsible, her kind elder sister happy, her flirtatious younger sisters respectable, and the rigidly judgmental Mr. Darcy humane.  This movie sent me on a quest to sample all of Ehle's other work, including film and Broadway.  She has proven an excellent actress in all fare.  But here she simply outdoes even her imposing self by giving the director a canvas fine enough to capture every single one of Austen's delicate brushstrokes.This production pulls depth out of Colin Firth that few others have.  Going back to his early turn in ""Another Country"" and his later work in ""Valmont"", he has always played a man dependent upon events and other people to awaken his humanity.  Here, however, his well-honed act fills the bill perfectly.  Supported by just the right costumers and hairdressers, he is the quintessence of baronial snobbishness cruising for its brush with emotional awakening.I cannot find a really sour note anywhere in the extensive cast, from the noisy Mrs. Bennett to the hilariously obsequious Reverend Collins and the crabbed Lady Catherine de Burgh.  Even Jane, whose purported beauty and excessively passive demeanor might not ring quite true with modern viewers, was a dead ringer for what the early 19th century viewed as a beautiful young woman comporting herself properly.I reread Jane Austen's novels every few years, and I'm certain I will until the end of my days.  And, if the first decade following this A&E; production is any indicator, I will watch this film over and over again.  The fact that novel and film each augments the other speaks to just how well done this movie is."	5.0	A Masterpiece Squared	2006-01-09	50	50	0

There's not a single character I would change: Jennifer Ehle plays Elizabeth with confidence, grace, and beauty (and a great deal of spirit!), Colin Firth is PERFECT as the (very!) handsome, but (at first) cynical and haughty Mr. Darcy, Ben Whitrow is a wonderful Mr. Bennet, with his dry humour and ready wit, and - what can I say? David Bamber practically steals the show as Mr. Collins, the ridiculous and devoted ""slave"" of Lady Catherine de Bourgh.Extremely accurate to Jane Austen's original book, fans will recognize line after line as much of the witty dialogue was taken straight from the original novel. Although it's five hours long, the delightful banter, lovely scenery, engaging dances and colourful characters make the movie interesting every minute. To any fan of the book, I would recommend this as the most amazing adaptation you will ever see!PS: I did NOT care for the 2005/Keira Knightly version AT ALL.

I understood everything. I loved the story, especially the relationship between the pretty and likeable Elizabeth and the handsome, proud Mr. Darcy kept me guessing all the time if his good qualities would shine through after he started falling for her and if she would soften up to him or not as I was hoping they would end up together after all.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1SPERUU1MVQK1	ian_alexander	"I cannot comment on this film without comparing it with thePride and Prejudice (BBC, 1980). If I hadn't seen the 1980 BBC's ""Pride and Prejudice"", I would probably adore this 1995 film like many people here. However, I must say that except the lavish decoration, this film is far inferior to the 1980 BBC's P&P; in every respect: screenplay, performance, music, etc.It's a pity that quite a few people are mistaken Jane Austen's spirited novel with a simple romantic story; one reviewer even praised the film as an epic. In her book, Austen writes about a serious topic with subtle humor, which is exactly what A&E; version fails to capture. Both movies have added some lines or scenes based on the original novel, however, the Garvie/Rintoul is more true to the novel. Some people like A&E; version because of the ""extras"" it offers, while some of these are described on the book such as Mr. Dancy's preventing his sister eloping with Wickham and later his searching for Lydia and Wickham in London, others are merely screenwriter's add-ons, three examples here, the first is Colin Firth came out of his bath and saw Jennifer Ehle playing with a dog, the second is the wet Colin Firth encountered Jennifer Ehle unexpectedly in Pemberly, and the third is Colin Firth practices fencing to show his determination of winning back Jennifer Ehle's affection. These are ridiculous and unnecessary. At the same time, the A&E; version has missed or changed some important scenes that are essential to the book. For instance, Lizzy's first piano performance at Lucas' ball (instead, she went off to teach Lydia how to behave). Most of the interesting dialogues between Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley are completely gone. Two in particular, one is after Mr. Darcy tells how he admires Elizabeth's beautiful eyes, the other is Miss Bingley's compliments about Mr. Darcy's writing. One dialogue is badly rewritten: in the book Mr. Darcy gives two reasons why he doesn't want to join Elizabeth and Miss Bingley in their walking about the room, here in the A&E; film, he's only shown half intelligent and sharp by omitting one reason. Also the part where Elizabeth observes and analyzes his father's attitude towards his wife is replaced by ""daily proof"". The last part where she analyzes how Mr. Darcy falls in love with her at the first place should have been kept.Regarding the acting, old BBC's version is more close to the period. Characters are more lady and gentlemen like. Characters in the A&E; version, on the contrary, do not behave as courtly as they should. Upon seeing Ehle crossing her arms when listening to her father's comments on her refusal to Mr. Collins' proposal, I dislike this Elizabeth considering her very rude.The A&E; version is entirely miscast with the exception of Charlotte or maybe Mr. Bennet. Jennifer Ehle misinterprets Lizzy totally. She's not even physically up to the description in the novel. She always reads her lines in a hurry and even needs to catch her breath in order to finish the sentence. She doesn't show any wit and appears proud and rude like the two Miss Bingley (when she went to visit her sick sister and came across with Colin Firth [another ""extra""], he appeared much more polite than she). Elizabeth Garvie's Lizzy is adorable, witty and beautiful. She IS Elizabeth, no doubt. Colin Firth is not a proud Darcy but rather a miserable one with gloomy eyes. David Rintoul may lack Firth's sensuality, but he IS the proud and satirical Mr. Darcy. A&E;'s Jane is not as sweet and beautiful as Sabina Franklyn's Jane. Bingley is OK but could be more candid. His sisters are hateful. Miss Bingley doesn't show any interest in pursuing Darcy (in the early BBC's version, Miss Bingley is perfectly portrayed by Marsha Fitzalan). Mr. Wickham is not as handsome and attractive as described in the book. Alison Steadman's Mrs. Benetts is nothing but noisy, Priscilla Morgan's Mrs. Bennet is a simple-minded mother whose entire interest is to have her 5 daughters well married. A&E;'s Mary is abominable while Tessa Peake-Jones's Mary is a young lovely bookworm with lot of comments. I particularly dislike David Bamber's Mr. Collins. He is not funny at all and appears despicable, Malcolm Rennie's Collins, instead is much more comical with his distinct long figure, awkward movements and some details such as the non-stop apology. Lady Catherine de Bourgh is OK but lack the bossiness as Judy Parfitt's portrayal of her.The music in 1980's version is a perfect match to the film.The A&E; version is a fine productin and a great entertainment, but definitely not Austen."	3.0	A fine productin but definitely not Austen	2003-04-12	17	10	7

Accept the lesser of the technological evils, because . . .You MUST own this P&P.;  In some form.  With whatever technical flaws.  You can't afford to rent it as often as you'll want to watch it.  You must own it.  You must.It correctly decides to be faithful to this perhaps best of all novels, except where necessary to adapt to video.  We must learn that ""A young man of large fortune must be in want of a wife,"" or it wouldn't be P&P;, would it?  Austen just wrote the words, but on video, somebody must SAY them.  The book just lets us read letters, but the video must have people read aloud or visit instead of writing, as when Mr. Collins comes to ""condole.""  I do not object to the few departures from the book, except to wish for ALL of the dialogue when Elizabeth teaches Lady Catherine that everyone in the family is not so obsequious as Mr Collins.The acting (so many star performances, no player less than superb), the direction, the costumes, the settings, the music? Simply the best; nobody ever did a better ARTISTIC job of anything on video. Ehle and Firth deserve all the praise by other reviewers.  (Watching Ehle play Elizabeth is like watching a movie of my mother at that age.  Could two women like that really be born?  Trivia freaks: who's EHLE's mom?) )  Benjamin Withrow is perfect as Mr. Bennet - none could be better.  However, I most admire the performances of Steadman as Mrs. Bennet, Bamber as Mr. Collins, and Leigh-Hunt as Lady Catherine.  Priceless!  It was surely not easy for Firth to make us believe that dearest, loveliest Elizabeth has moderated Darcy's pride (just today came an email came saying that women think they can change the men they love, and men think women won't change, and that both are wrong).  However, Steadman, Bamber, and Leigh-Hunt have the far more difficult task of being taken seriously as fools (along the host of Lucas and Bingley fools in smaller roles).  They aren't allowed the fun that Sawalha has in her perfect (except for not being the tallest sister, as in the book, hardly her fault) portrayal of the wild thoughtless ditzy Lydia. I'm sorry not to have space to praise all other players in large roles and small (would Susannah Harker be interested in an older man? . . . sigh . . .).HOWEVER . . . ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY . . .After wearing out one VHS set, almost wearing out another, then being disappointed that the first DVD was no better, I really looked forward to this ""digitally remastered"" edition. At last, the orange cast would be gone, and the murky fuzziness would give way to the crystalline images we expect from DVD's of stuff shot in the mid-90's. I should have wondered why the special edition was (...) cheaper than the earlier DVD.  The orange cast is indeed gone -- everything's turquoise now. I'll leave the candle-lit scenes to your imagination. The images are indeed more contrasty - everything lighter than medium gray is fried to a cheesy bluish-white, all shadow detail blends into stygian sameness. What a horrid horrid thing to do to all those lovely juicy blushing young actresses! It looks like A&E;, just for this project, brought in the kid who got the worst grades in digital video class at some backwater community college, and didn't check out his finished product.  At least he appears to have learned a few things as he went along, because the first disk is the worst.  Is this really from the same people who did those lovely DVD editions of ""Lillie"" and ""I Claudius,"" both shot a quarter-century ago? Even if the source were limited to the older DVD edition, just about ANYbody could have remastered it better.Oh well. I think I'll just fix one frame at a time (from the original DVD edition) on my computer with Adobe Photoshop, then play it from my hard drive when I'm finished in time for the 200th anniversary of JA's death. I've given up on waiting for A&E; to fix it.UPDATE: Well, it finally DID get fixed -- and how.  If anyone is still reading this, the new version remastered from the original negative is technically flawless, removing all issues discussed above.  I have bought it on Blu-ray, where it comes as close to artistic and technological perfection as even the finickiest viewer has any right to expect.PS - Anybody who thinks this is a ""chick flick"" just doesn't understand Jane Austen, who like Elizabeth Bennet and her father, considers human weaknesses to be the ultimate entertainment.  Austen often makes her thrust with the last word(s) in a sentence or paragraph that may have started innocuously enough.  That last word shoves in the dagger and twists it.  Ehle gets my favorite line in P&P; - ""There are few people I love, and even fewer of whom I think well.""  Or is it her dad's ""For what do we live, except to make sport for our neighbors, and laugh at them in our turn?""  Anybody who dismisses Austen as a frothy romance novelist just can't read."	5.0	Artistic Triumph, Technology Disaster: buy the other edition	2001-11-09	14	12	2

Although long, this version is worth the watching if you want to truly see the book come to life!  The only thing missing with this new DVD set would have been optional subtitles, because even when you get used to the accents I still feel like I miss some of the words and that would have been helpful.  Otherwise I would have given it a 5 star rating!	4.0	The Best Version Ever Made	2007-03-08	5	5	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A327SNRHRAA6ES	"Jake B ""Jake"""	I have become a big fan of the British 'costume dramas' and this has to be the best of the bunch. It has more romance, suspence and majesty than, for example, Emma or Sense and Sensibility.The Andrew Davies adaptation from Austin's book is superb and the casting is a masterstroke. They stayed away from using world famous cinemtaic names such as Emma Thompson and utilised 'relative' unknowns outside of the UK. Colin Firth as Darcy is  fantastic, brooding and evasive. The sisters are as diverse in personality as one could wish. Jeniffer Ehle as Elizabeth has that rare quality of a beauty thats grows on you to become truly deep. Both their acting skills are perfect in this film but really gets swept away by the acting of the more flamboyant characters. Alison Steadman as Mrs Bennet brings tears to my eyes. Her manner, attitude, belief in her Daughters being the highlight of society and her relationship with her husband is a pleasure to watch. Benjamin Whitrow playing 'Mister Bennet' as his wife would often shout is beautifully dry and sarcastic. Perhaps the greatest character acting is portrayed by David Bamber as Mr Collins. He is the most oily, greasy obsequious character I have ever come across and the way he tilted his head and rubs his hands 'oh, cousin Elizabeth' is one of the highlights for me.One to watch when you have a spare few hours and you need reminding how wonderful life and love is.	5.0	What a story!	2005-02-27	9	9	0

I held off converting to the DVD version mainly due to the high cost, and am I ever glad that I did! This newly released 2 disc set is a vast improvement over the previous one if for no other reason than it is letterboxed in 1:85/1 format which really brings the story and characters into much sharper focus. One of the features I love best about DVD is the ability to review old favorite films with a clarity of image and sound which makes the entire experiance new and rewarding, and this beautiful version of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a great example. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth seem born to assay thier roles, leading a sterling cast of great British character actors in a spirited romp through the magnificent English countryside. Like Emma Thompson's award winning adaption of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, this film really breathes life into Jane Austin's tale. It was well worth waiting to see it in this DVD transfer.	5.0	I'M SO GLAD I WAITED FOR THIS DVD VERSION!	2002-01-12	5	5	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3THSGE4JMQRJC	James M	I have read the Jane Austin Books and I particularly enjoy this BBC version with Colin Firth. The costumes and acting are wonderful. Firth in particular does a great job (probably his most famous role until the King's Speech) as does Ehle. The supporting cast is also great (Mr Collins is played by David Bamber who also has a small part in the King's Speech).My only personal issue is with the story : it just seems too convenient for most young woman's romantic fantasies to have the very rich male character also be the virtuous Mr. Right. No guarantee of that in real life... but that, after all, is a part of Jane Austen's material. The subtleties of Mr Darcy's character are very well portrayed by Colin Firth.	5.0	Superb Acting by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle	2011-11-07	2	1	1

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1RECBDKHVOJMW	"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana"""	Jane Austin's wonderful novel, of marriage and mores in Regency England, is faithfully adapted in this magnificent BBC/A&amp;E production, directed by Simon Langton.The film clearly reflects Ms. Austin's theories on the importance of marriage for women of the Regency period. Most women were not educated, except for the social graces; acquiring, at least, some proficiency in music, needlework and &quot;acceptable&quot; literature, and learning skills essential to running a household. Considerable pressure was placed on women to marry well, to obtain financial security and social position, not just for themselves, but also for their immediate family. Love matches were rare.The film opens in a small community in Hertfordshire, England. Word is out that the empty Netherfield estate has been leased to a new occupant - a wealthy bachelor. Mothers and daughters suddenly upset their daily routine, and shatter the local tranquility - buying dress material, sewing, embroidering, planning and fantasizing about balls and marriage, and, of course, gossiping. Nowhere is there more excitement than at the Bennett home, where five very marriageable daughters anticipate news of their neighbor. The Bennett's have a particular reason for wishing their girls settled. The Bennett estate, Longbourn, is entailed. It can only be inherited by a male successor. Since the Bennett's have no son, their entire estate will go to Mr. Bennett's cousin. The girls must be married well and settled, so they will have a secure home when their father dies. If their mother should outlive her spouse, they will have to provide for her also. Marriage is a serious business in this period.There is a ball in honor of John Bingley, Crispin Bonham-Carter), the new resident at Netherfield, and for the friends who accompany him. Bingley is very taken with Jane Bennett, the eldest daughter, and a lovely young woman with a sweet disposition. Susannah Harker is perfectly cast in this role. The feelings are reciprocated and the two form an attachment. It is at this ball that Elizabeth Bennett (Jennifer Ehle), the family's second daughter, meets Bingley's friend, the aristocratic Fitzwilliam Darcy, (Colin Firth). Darcy, is much wealthier than Bingley. He is a handsome, intelligent man, and the Lord of Pemberly, a large, sumptuous estate in Derbyshire. Darcy, however, is the epitome of haughtiness when he arrives on the scene and looks down his nose at the local gentry. Elizabeth Bennett, is quite different from most young women of the Regency Period. She has a strong intellect and her father had encouraged her to become literate, and to enjoy fine books and literary conversation. She is bright, with a sharp wit, more independent than her sisters, and very pretty with &quot;fine eyes.&quot; Darcy is attracted to her immediately, but snubs her unknowingly. She responds in kind, thinking him to be boorish and far too proud. Thus she is prejudiced against him from their first meeting.Elizabeth and Darcy's strong mutual attraction, and the conflict between them, which prevents them from forming a potentially rich relationship, provide an interesting tension throughout the film. Darcy's proud arrogance in his social class and position, and Elizabeth's prejudice against such haughtiness, seem to inhibit all promise of romance.Ms. Austin's delightful characters, are brilliantly cast here, including: George Wickham, (Adrian Lukis), a handsome military officer who further prejudices Elizabeth against Darcy with tales from their mutual past; William Collins, (David Bamber), a pompous clergyman, cousin to the Bennetts, and probable heir to the family holdings; Charlotte Lucas, (Lucy Scott), a young neighbor and dear friend to Elizabeth and Jane; and Lady Catherine De Bourgh, (Barbara Leigh-Hunt), the quintessential aristocrat. Jennifer Ehle is the perfect Lizzy Bennett. She sparkles with wit and intelligence, and is just beautiful enough to be believable. Colin Firth brings the proud, but feeling, Mr. Darcy to life. And he is so handsome.The scenery is breathtaking, the settings and costumes accurate to the period, the dialogue is faithful to the novel. Watching the film, it is almost impossible not to feel transported in time, back to Regency England, and become very involved with the loves, foibles, problems, and adventures of the wonderful Austin characters, brought so realistically to life, in this amazing production.

Anderson	"With over 1500 other reviews on Amazon for this DVD set, why write another one?Because it's a great series, that's why!OK -- confession time: I'd never been a fan of ""chick"" authors such as Jane Austen, but boy, was I mistaken!  Friends at work turned me on to this series when it first appeared on A&E;, and I was immediately sucked into the story.  And what a great story it is!The adaptation remains very faithful to the novel (a fact which I discovered when I read the book after I'd seen the series), so much so that a pivotal scene that occurs *exactly* half way through the book also occurs *exactly* half-way through the series.Colin Firth plays a Darcy that I don't believe shall ever be equaled (a role that he seems to have reprised, time and again, in later films), and the entire cast, from top to bottom, is great.  That, coupled with set and costume design that seems to authentically replicate the period, gives the series a lushness and depth that is a pleasure to watch.The series stands up well to multiple viewings (always a sign of a great film).  In fact, it's one of my favorite things to watch during the Christmas Holidays when it's cold and wet outside.Anyway -- it's well worth five stars, and if anyone has not yet seen it (hard as that is to believe), my advice is: get thee to the video store!"	5.0	Outstanding Adaptation	2008-12-25	0	0	0

I have owned the tapes and the original DVD.  As far as the movie itself goes, the characters are all perfectly cast.  From the embarassingly annoying Mrs. Bennet, the sweet oldest sister Jane, the condescending and IQ challenged Mr. Collins, to the feisty Elizabeth and the Proud Mr. Darcy, you will find yourself engrossed in every character's story. Colin Firth is the perfect Mr. Darcy, and manages to steal almost every scene he is in.  The actors really seem to enjoy playing these bigger than life characters.  The script was written to stay true to the original novel.  The scenery in breathtaking, and you will find yourself paying as much attention to the beautiful countryside as you will the drama.As for technical details, the biographies that are included on this special version are simply printed words on the screen.  Interesting information, but each bio is only one or two paragraphs long with a complete list of credits for only a few of the characters.  The mini featurette is okay.My bottom line:  if you love romance, drama, and history then this is the movie for you.  If you already own it on tape or have the original dvd, save your money and enjoy the version you have.Update- 12/2005...I have watched this series a few times now.

It is truly a book which contains something for everyone; romance, comedy, action and satire.So, of course, when I was looking to buy a DVD version of the book, I was a bit skeptical about how a DVD version of it could possible stand up to the greatness of the book, but after buying this version and viewing it, I can truthfully say that my doubts have vanished and that I have found my new favorite DVD.The makers and actors behind this movie are geniuses, in that they have created a wonderfuly movie that contains all of the elements of the book.  All of the actors and actresses have done excellent work in portraying the character, especially Colin Firth's performance as Mr. Darcy.The beautifuly scenery, marvelous acting, and excellent directing, along with the extra features and special booklet, have made this DVD one that should not be missed.  Because even if you're not a Jane Austen fan, or even heard of her for that matter, you WILL love this movie and anyone, yes, even macho lovers of war flicks and haters of romance or chick flicks, will enjoy, even if not admittedely, this movie.

The dvd version looks nice with sharp, clear colors and a wider screen image. I just think this is the closest to perfection any Austen adaptation has come. The movie takes six hours to tell a detailed story in a leisurely fashion. Almost all the major scenes from the novel are included, and most of the dialogue is right from Austen's pen. I've heard lots of complaints that the actress who plays Jane isn't pretty enough, but beauty is so subjective I don't know who would have pleased everybody. And Jennifer Ehle might indeed be prettier than Lizzy should be, but the only complaint I had with her was that she looked way too old. She's supposed to be 20 and Darcy around 25, but they each looked mid-30's to me. Other than that, I have no complaints with the film. I still remember anxiously awaiting each episode to come on tv, and from time to time my husband and I will still get the dvd's out and watch the whole thing again over a couple of nights.

I really liked her, she was a great actress, and played Elizabeth well, but seemed to be good only when by herself. As soon as the two were together, I had a hard time feeling the pull of attraction between them and I'm not sure why. In any case, it's a worthwhile rendition, over five hours long and worth the time I think.[...]"	3.0	Firth is the only redeeming quality of this movie	2012-04-19	7	1	6

This miniseries gives a more detailed look at life during the early 19th century than a movie allows for. The total effortlessness of upper class life was portrayed especially well; rich people never seemed to request anything, their servants just knew what was required. The importance of restraint in society as opposed to the lack restraint in the Bennet family is also well emphasized. I, too, did not enjoy the portrayal of Mrs. Bennett; it was much too much. Mr. Collins is as annoying as he needs to be. Elizabeth is portrayed with many layers of emotion, from restraint to anguish. Mr. Darcy's portrayal is also quite good. The miniseries is very good.If I had seen this before I saw the 2005 movie, it would probably be my fave version of the story. Alas, I did not; that movie remains my fave.	5.0	The Triumph of Love, In Spite of Restraint	2013-11-28	2	2	0

It made Colin Firth into a star, and apparently made lots of British boys named Darcy at around the time the series came out.  My wife and I were riveted by this series -- the adaptation is true to the book's letter and spirit, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle lead a uniformly excellent cast (though Alison Steadman's over-the-top Mrs. Bennett is a little too shrill and unsympathetic for my taste, the satirical edge a little too harsh).The boxed set unfortunately is a little light on the extras -- there is a  behind the scenes video which is vaguely informative, no commentary tracks, and admittedly, one probably shouldn't expect much of a 1995 series that was presumably produced without a deluxe DVD issue in mind.  But it's very well worth having for a classic adaptation of Jane Austen's most popular novel.	5.0	A classic TV adaptation in fair packaging	2006-12-09	11	10	1

I expected it to be much better than it was.  Due to the length it had more of the book in it but seemed to drag and at times be down right boring.  I made the mistake of reading the enclosure with the actors/actresses comments as the comments of the lead actress made me dislike her.  I don't remember ever seeing her in anything else and her complaining about how difficult the role was and how long it took to film probably affected by opinion. In a period piece like this I would also prefer the actors project a more masculine image since they have to wear such frilly clothingI would say it is an average mini-series, nothing special about it.

The actors are wonderful. Despite other reviews,I think Colin Firth is wonderful as Darcy,his acting skills make it easy to discern Darcy's thoughts without need for dialogue. This version has several nice touches-after Lizzie and Darcy's blowout argument while Lizzie is visiting Charlotte,we see our 2 main characters ruminating over each others words,whilst seeing the others reflection in mirror. I felt this version beautifully shows,as the book did,Lizzy and Darcy's realization of how prejudiced they are about each other and their families-and subsequently how they overcome this.

Dyer ""dyerbag"""	"Having seen every film version of Pride and Prejudice that one can obtain today, I definitely award the palm to this one, with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.  The BBC version from 1982 is also charming; its TV-standard shortcomings in lighting, cinematography, and editing can be overlooked; but there is simply no comparison between Firth and David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy.Colin Firth uniquely hits off the character of a very reserved man who is forced ""out of himself"" by attraction to an unexpected young woman.  Laurence Olivier was too suave and polished (as well as too old) to carry this off as well as Firth does, evoking more the air of an offended politician than an entrenched, unawakened country gentleman.  Rintoul in the 1982 version is suitably rough around the edges, but works too hard and displays too visibly Darcy's gradual thawing in the presence of Elizabeth Bennet.  Firth hides it better, as the character Darcy would have, while still letting the viewer in on the process.I did enjoy Elizabeth Garvie in the 1982 version, but I was equally well satisfied with Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet.  If she did not come off quite as youthful as Garvie (Ehle was only in her late 20s when she made P&P;), I find her more convincing as a girl who prizes wit and excels at it.  A delightful and very pretty actress, she seems well matched with her Mr. Darcy.Most of the secondary characters are nicely done in this 1995 version, which has by far the best Mr. Bennet of any cinematic P&P.;  Other stand-outs include Jane Bennet and Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  I preferred only one character from the 1982 version:  Mr. Collins, whose foolishness was better served by a large, doughy actor than the rather ferret-like (if hysterical) David Bamber in the '95 remake.  (A larger Mr. Collins is also, of course, truer to Austen's original.)The grand scale on which the characters live in this version is probably not as true to Jane Austen's world as the environment created (on smaller budgets) in previous films.  In that sense the infusion of American money decried by some reviewers is regrettable; but it certainly makes for entertaining scenery.  Beyond an anachronistic freedom of manner in the younger Miss Bennets, the other questionable aspect of the social environment evoked in this version is the incessant curtseying and bowing by persons of all ages and social status.  I notice that American-oriented films depicting Regency England are usually replete with it, whereas films made by Brits for British audiences are not."	5.0	Best adaptation of a beloved classic	2005-10-20	8	8	0

What I mean is that the credits are there after every section the same as on the vhs and the same as when it was on tv. That was pretty annoying. and like all dvd's it tends to skip every once and a while. but nothing lasting. its a great movie, well worth the long 6 hour watch.Jenna	4.0	Good Movie, mediocre way it was put together	2001-07-22	4	2	2

Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth truly seem to become Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. Everything about this mini series is  spectacular, from the script (and adaptations are not easy!), the costumes,  casting, and sets! If you have read the book, you will be enchanted by this  series. (and most movies from books are dreadfully bad, may I remind you)  If you haven't read the book, you will love this movie as well, sending you  right to your local library so you CAN read the book!	5.0	A Must See!	2000-01-30	6	5	1
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2IXV2QW0A8U3F	Jennifer French	The acting in this version of P&amp;P is EXCELLENT.  Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth has her sass and cheek.  She shows Elizabeth's gradual love for Darcy perfectly.  The actress who plays Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingly are very well done.  The mother and younger sisters are played almost too well.  (The screaching of the mother gets tiresome after a while.)  The stand out performance of this movie is by far Colin Firth.  I did not know who he was, typical of Americans I'm sure, but I do now.  He can speak clearly with his eyes.  It is rare for an actor to have such a gift.  An example of what I'm talking about is the scene where Darcy watches Elizabeth play the piano with his sister.  Breathtaking!!  I have, also, just had the pleasure to watch Mr. Firth in &quot;Bridget Jones Diary.&quot;  As far as I concerned, Hollywood needs to snatch him up with joy.  You have made a new American fan, Mr. Firth.  However, simply put, this is an excellent film.	5.0	A Wonderful Rendition of Pride &amp; Prejudice	2001-10-18	2	2	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2R7U6VHLD9S5T	Jennifer	Pride and Pregeduce is the best movie I've ever seen.  Elizabeth and her five sisters kind hearted father and wild mother all contribute to the story along with Mr.Darcy and the rest.  They picked the best people to play the parts of the strong woman (Elizabeth Benit) and cold at first but in the end is quite nice to be with(Mr.Darcy). Elizabeth is the 2nd of 5 girls in her family and her mother is trying to get them married.  Mr.Darcy is a nice person on the inside but cold on the outside and has feelings for Elizabeth but on the otherhand Elizabeth hates him.  It all works it self out in the end and you'll agree with the ending.

I used to watch my VHS tapes at least once a year but only watched the ""special edition"" DVD one time because I just couldn't bear the dark and drab colors, especially the indoor scenes. In some of the scenes the characters even looked a bit green. Then I popped in the Blu-Ray last night and it was amazing!  The colors are beautiful and there is great detail. I compared the DVD and Blu-Ray side by side during one scene and the difference was truly amazing.  The special features are new and quite interesting as they include current-day interviews with several actors, the writer and director.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A10T0OW97SFBB	Jesse Rouse	Having read the book, I was very much looking forward to seeing this movie when a friend of mine told me about it.  I was not dissapointed in the least.  In fact, this is one of the rare cases where I liked the movie better than the book, though I loved the book as well.  This movie was simply cast perfectly, and it followed the book better than perhaps any other movie I have ever seen.In short, it is the book come to life for you to watch.  The wit of Mr. Bennett, the rediculous smile of Mr. Collins, the utter rediculousness of Jane and Elizabeth's mother and sisters, and the optomism and friendliness of Mr. Bingley all are exactly as you imagine them when reading the book.  The acting is superb, and ever character plays their parts to perfection.  I enjoyed this immensly, and I imagine that you will too if you enjoyed the book at all.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AO3ZVS2A1SZ3Y	J. Gabrielson	While I did truly enjoy this version of Pride and Prejudice, which I have seen in both VHS and DVD( I own the DVD),I prefer the 1985 BBC release starring Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul, which I own in both versions.My first reason involves the language used, the script and the dialogue. Fay Weldon does wonders in recreating the language of the original book. Many of Austen's keenest observations of human absurdity can only exist in her own words in a verbal form. The 1985 version retains many of her most famous observations in their entirety. The Firth-Erle version does not retain enough of the original language.The second reason is that Harker is not pretty enough to be the Jane to Erle's Elizabeth. This is very annoying! One of the most important plot points is that Jane is the prettiset of the Bennet girls. Elizabeth is the most intelligent, rational and sensible of the girls and she is her father's favorite; but she is NOT prettier than Jane. Harker is also not believeable as a sweet, lovable girl. She is herself too intelligent and she cannot disguise that quality. All in all. Harker as Jane was a poor piece of castingThirdly, while I adore Colin Firth as a Romantic hero, he does not have enough reserve or stateliness to play Darcy. He does not conceal his passions well enough. I still like him, but he is not perfect in the role as David Rintoul is perfect.There are many fine performances of more minor roles in both productions that make both of them worth viewing. I recommend the Lady Catherines in both productions, the Mr. & Mrs. Bennets, the Mr. Collins and many others.	4.0	The second-best Pride and prejudice	2006-01-24	7	3	4

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AFQBS241UKPAZ	J. Gitzlaff	I will not repeat all of the praise given by other reviewers with regard to the acting, the screenplay, and the filming of this wonderful version of Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  I watched it under protest from my then-girlfriend/now-wife, and reluctantly became a major fan not only of this miniseries but also of Austen's books in general.  If that's not high praise I don't know what is.As wonderful as this miniseries is, and as significant a success as it has been, it is rather astonishing to me that its producers would have shlocked together this &quot;Special Edition DVD&quot; in such a clumsy manner.  We actually own both the &quot;Special Edition&quot; and the older &quot;ordinary&quot; DVD version of this miniseries.  Here are the notable differences:(1) The original DVD version displays the show in fullscreen 4:3 aspect ratio, precisely as it was televised in the United States.  The &quot;Special Edition&quot; displays the show in letterbox format.  Kudos for the &quot;Special Edition&quot;, it makes the staging of various shots more enjoyable to watch.(2) The original DVD version merely pasted together all of the episodes to the miniseries.  In between episodes, the original DVD dutifully replayed all of the opening and closing credits in the places where a television viewer would have seen them.  The &quot;Special Edition&quot; removes all but the first and last credit rolls, allowing the viewer to be more immersed in the storyline.  Again, kudos for the Special Edition.(3) The original version demonstrated vibrant colors, good exposure and contrast, and an all-around pleasant and detailed picture.  The &quot;Special Edition&quot; has dull, washed out colors with overexposed bright areas and underexposed dark areas in every scene.  For instance, during the first dance on disc one, Darcy's hair looks exactly the same as Darcy's shirt which looks exactly the same as the wood panelling on the wall behind him which looks exactly the same as Caroline's hair:  i.e., all of them are &quot;black&quot; with no internal detail whatsoever.  We have switched back and forth between the original/&quot;Special&quot; DVDs to verify, and the difference is unmistakeable and rather astonishing.  In this category, the &quot;original&quot; DVD wins hands-down.It's sad, really.  So close to releasing the definitive version of the show, and yet so far.  Maybe there will someday be a &quot;third&quot; release where the producers will finally get it all right.	4.0	Wonderful adaptation, poor DVD transfer	2003-04-08	29	29	0

After having watched many other adaptations of what is one of my most favorite books of all, I have to admit that this is the best.  Not only does it follow Jane Austen's book, but it has the added enhancement of Colin Firth!The acting is wonderful, as is the setting, the script (as insinuated prior), and the costumes.  They are all very accurate and there is nothing more that I despise then a good period movie/play/book that is ruined by the wearing of plastic wristwatch or obvious electric lighting when none was available at that time.My only complaints are the ones that have been listed in previous posts.  The picture is over bright and there is not much to the 'EXTRA SPECIAL' additions.  I can only surmise that the transfer from PAL was poorly done or they weren't watching their levels.The best thing is that I can go straight to the Bath scene and the Pond scene with just a click of my remote, and that more than makes up for the poor picture quality!  I do not regret purchasing this DVD.That being said, I would not give up the opportunity to purchase a better quality DVD should it become available - as long as there is color correction and subtitles.	4.0	Despite a few Petty Bugs, I deem it excellent	2003-10-31	5	5	0

I agree with many of the things previous reviews have said although I disagree about the incorrect casting for the part of Jane.  Athough she is not the knock-out you may have expected her to be, she is the epitome of late-eighteenth century beauty. She is the personification of the period's cameo.

I waited to purchased this DVD version since earlier reviews stated that the early DVD version had washed out colors. I've viewed the 2 DVD's so far (not the extra bonus DVD yet). The colors in the feature movie are indeed washed out, but not too badly. I adjusted my television settings (LCD) to increase the contrast and warm up the colors. It displayed much nicer with that adjustment. You will probably have to put those settings back when you watch other DVD's. The sound and picture quality are otherwise fine. The book is very good also. I'd highly recommend this even though the film could have been translated better to DVD.	4.0	Just purchased the 10th annivesary edition.	2006-09-28	20	19	1

It truly keeps to Jane Austen's spirit of the story and every character is played with authenticism. Costumes, sets, and manners are true to the period. I was surprised at how amusing the story was! Even my husband laughed!Colin Firth steals the show as Mr. Darcy. What an actor! He simply smoulders! His portrayal is so true that one can no longer picture Darcy in any other form, once seen here. Darcy is a complex man, and not all as confident as one assumes at first. Firth brings out both Darcy's strengths and his shortcomings in a very appealing performance. Thank you very much, Mr. Firth!Best scenes are Elizabeth's refusal of Darcy's first proposal and her confrontation with Lady Catherine. His second proposal and their reconciliation is also done perfectly. And, yes,... Mr. Darcy emerging from the lake.... need I say more?This is the best by far!	5.0	The best P & P adaptation!	2008-04-28	0	0	0

I enjoy this BBC series very much but boy, the DVD transfer quality is utmost terrible.Like one of the reviewers mentioned, the color is washed out; the contrast is way off.  The advertised widescreen format is somewhat deceptive.  It looks as though someone chopped off the top and bottom from the 4:3 version.  As a result, in many scenes the heads and feet are chopped from the screen.  The picture looks very grainy and is no where near the quality one may expect from DVD.  Frankly, one is better off to watch the VHS version.It's unfortunate that we tossed the VHS collection when we bought this DVD set a few years ago.  I should have transfered that into DVDs.It's still a lovely movie to watch and one may be immensed in the story enough to forget the painful quality... for the most part.	3.0	Great movie but painful to watch	2007-12-23	3	2	1

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1HXT8DSV199NV	"J. Le ""meow"""	Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle played Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth flawlessly (far surpassing Elizabeth Garvie & David Rintoul and putting Keira Knightley & Matthew Macfadyen to shame).Having watched the miniseries/movies before reading the book, below are my brief impressions of the portrayal of Jane Austen's beloved story.... (As I write this review I am half-way through the book) I found BBC's 1980 rendition of Pride and Prejudice very difficult to watch. The acting was awkward overall. This A&E; and BBC production flowed beautifully. Mrs. Bennet was obnoxious but bearable compared to the 1980's Mrs. Bennet. The story appears to follow the story closely. I found myself rewatching my favorite seens over and over (mostly scenes where Mr. Darcy is interacting with Elizabeth). For the Keira Knightley fans... I am sorry but she cannot act.	5.0	Best portrayal of Pride and Prejudice	2009-10-22	0	0	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A8F2AZWB20X1H	JLind555	"This is the third film version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" and A&E; let all the stops out in their attempt to top the other two.  Unfortunately, this version falls short on most counts.The most glaring problem, besides the film's attempt to re-write some of Austen's dialogue (one does not re-write Austen, no matter what the temptation), is the fatal mistake of casting Colin Firth as Darcy.  Firth is a fine actor, but he tried to turn Darcy into a very 1990's character, and that just isn't Austen's Darcy.  A second problem was the character of Jane Bennet, who in this film spends most of her time whining and moralizing.  Austen never meant her to come across like that, and in this version she is just plain irritating.Most of the other actors were far inferior to the actors in the BBC version, with the notable exceptions of Alison Steadman as Mrs. Bennet, and Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  Steadman was a riot, just as ditzy and wacky as Austen intended her to be, and Leigh-Hunt was a real gorgon as Lady Catherine.  As far as the character of Elizabeth Bennet is concerned, Jennifer Ehle had a tough act to follow but she was surprisingly good in this role.Overall, I got the impression that the producers of this version tried to out-Austen Austen, and overplayed their hand.  The BBC version was simpler, more concise, and much more effective.  I enjoyed watching the A&E; version once, but I wouldn't watch it twice.

Shipp ""Book Lover, Foodie, Philosopher"""	I was ecstatic to find that this Miniseries was put on DVD. Although, quite a lengthy tale, it is one that is most sufferable. Some people find English movies and tales a linguistic obstacle. Words carry great depth and there is a forte for which the English have when carrying out their feelings and convictions.I love the mystery found in English period pieces. The word-play can literally send you into a frenzy to figure out the next tidbit.Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth play the title characters - Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth is frank, sweet, intelligent, playful, free-spirited, witty, and loving. Mr. Darcy is brooding, interferring, cold, sarcastic, and blunt.Firth really makes you hate Mr. Darcy. He is as friendly as jack frost.These two seem born to play these roles. They reverbate off one another. When the pair are in the scene together, you can feel the intensity.You'll find that Mr. Darcy isn't all bad, but he has been conditioned much by his station in life. Elizabeth teaches him a lesson or two. He gets a huge reality check from her heart!Firth and Ehle are supported by a wonderful cast of characters. Some of these include an overemotional self-centered mother, a complacent and witty father, an bungling cousin, an earnest and loving sister, and 4 other sisters wild in character and temperment... plus many other entertaining supporting characters.It is a Romance to rival all others as well as drama and comedy of words. A masterpiece. I dare to say that another remake would fail to surpass the eloquence of this production.	5.0	Perfection of Character	2002-01-20	1	1	0

Overall the transfer is outstanding evidently thanks to recent breakthroughs in technology that enabled it (according to the included special feature on the subject).  Film-like look with very tight grain and super color gamut with color accuracy and amazing image sharpness considering the source.  While there are a few digitization artifacts here and there (i.e. dithering in the crack of a slightly open door in the background of one shot and several isolated luminance variations in a few frames of some other shots), but this is really minor stuff in the 300 minutes of material.I had recently read the novel that I had managed to avoid for 68+ years (since it came free of charge on my wife's Nook and I had time to kill).  Necessarily long for what it does so very well and a beautiful piece of writing providing a comprehensive and incisively detailed insight into gentrified 1810 English countryside life.  This BluRay transfer of these six 50-minute episodes is a virtual screenplay directly from the dialogue-rich novel.  I don't think anything of consequence was left out or truncated.

It's one of the very few lapses in this wonderful series.  While it's more than OK to ""open up"" the drama by, for example, starting it out with Darcy on horseback, scenes such as these add little to a classic narrative drive.Hard to carp, though:  this remains, along with the Nero Wolfe series, a major triumph for A&E; and creates an expectation for more of the same in the future.

Admire	"I say that in the title without having yet seen the latest version of P&P; starring Keira Knightley, but I think I'm pretty safe in going with the tide of public opinion on the A&E; version (which I added to my permanent library today after having earlier rented it via Netflix).  It's the best and most detailed version of the classic novel put to film - and that includes the famous Greer Garson/Laurence Olivier version, which is, in all truth, a great classic movie in its own right but had to telescope a lot of the events to stay within a standard theatrical running time (a problem which I think also will affect the newest version).  TV provides a much better format for the telling of long stories in miniseries format where all the details can properly be explicated.The producers of this program also are responsible for the excellent 1996 version of Austen's ""Emma"" which was an early Kate Beckinsale vehicle."	5.0	"The best version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" I've seen so far"	2005-11-13	5	5	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1J3C23D6AYODI	"Joseph E. Demartino ""jdemarti10"""	"First thing first:  The adaptation itself is a classic, the best filmed version of this often-filmed novel.  And the Blu-Ray release shows off the Super 16mm photography in ways never before possible.  It is like seeing it again for the first time - only it never looked this good back then.  But this ""new"" disc has EXACTLY the same contents as the ""old"" Blu-Ray release.In 2009 the BBC undertook a major restoration of 1995 Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle ""Pride & Prejudice"".  They went back to the original camera negatives to create a new hi-def master that was released on Blu-Ray in the spring of 2009.In 2010 they took the same hi-def master and downconverted it to use for a new widescreen standard-def DVD release, adding some of the supplements created for the 2009 Blu-Ray version and creating new cover art to distinguish this release from previous DVD versions.At the same time they decided to re-issue the 2009 using the same cover art as the new SD-DVD version.  As far as I can tell, the packaging (and the SKU #) is the ONLY difference between the ""new"" 2010 2-disc Blu-Ray set and the ""old"" 2009 2-disc Blu-Ray set. Well, that and the price.  As of May 19, 2010, as I'm writing this review, Amazon is selling the ""new"" version for $35.49, while you can still buy the ""old"" version - with identical disc contents but a different cover - for $23.99.  BTW, the listing of the aspect ratio for this release as 1.33:1 is simply an error.  This mistake appeared in the specifications on the A&E; site when they first announced the U.S. release of the set, even though the description said ""widescreen"" and the video clip provided (a ""before and after"" demo from the restoration documentary originally included on the 2009 version) was obviously in widescreen.So unless you really like the new cover art, and I'll grant you the old version had too much Colin and not enough Jennifer, I'd suggest you save the $11.50 and buy the old set while supplies last.You can order it here.Regards,Joe"	4.0	Re-packaging of 2009 Blu-Ray.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2DSXA1E02C86D	Joseph Haschka	"I watched PRIDE AND PREJUDICE under pressure from an email keyboard-pal, who had previously, at my urging, viewed my own favorite film of all time (THE LION IN WINTER) and now demanded reciprocity. It was my male pride versus her prejudice. But guilt is a powerful corrosive, so I caved, and was pleasantly surprised. I understand that this 1996 A&E; TV miniseries version is extremely faithful to the original Jane Austen novel, so at least I won't have to read the latter! P&P;'s length (> 5 hours) and the number of characters and subplots involved make it difficult to write a relatively short review of this delightful comedy of the heart. Perhaps the film could be subtitled ""The Romantic Perils of Young Maidens Stranded In the Stix"", or ""Seeking A Prince Charming to Rescue One from Rural Boredom"". Either one is sufficiently descriptive of the storyline, though feminists may bristle. But, let's face it. Even though neither the year nor the reigning monarch is ever mentioned, as I recall, the time is likely concurrent to Austen's penning of the story, i.e. the first decade of the 19th century, when feminism wasn't big.The Bennets are minor, money-strapped landed gentry living in the rural south of England. The parents (Benjamin Whitrow and Alison Steadman) have five daughters: Elizabeth (Jennifer Ehle), Jane (Susannah Harker), Lydia (Julia Sawalha), Kitty (Polly Maberly), and Mary (Lucy Briers). Dad is a kindly and utterly sensible man in early old age who remains slightly bemused that he never managed to father a son. Mom is a hyperexcitable and materialistic woman, who, when not fussing about her own material future after her husband dies, is obsessed with getting the girls married off. To that end, the oldest daughter, Jane, may or may not have a future with Mr. Bingley (Crispin Bonham-Carter), a perky young gentleman who's recently bought a country home nearby. Bingley smiles excessively, but has the advantage of an annual income of 5,000 pounds sterling. The second oldest, Elizabeth, has more than her fair share of suitors, one of whom, Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth), inspires in her feelings ranging from perplexity to loathing to love depending on circumstance. Darcy is remarkably deficient in social skills, but is enormously wealthy and master of a Great House up north in Derbyshire. The other daughters - the ""silliest girls in England"" according to Mr. Bennet - must make do with the young officers of an army regiment locally encamped. The major thread of P&P; is the rocky evolution of the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy.All roles are wonderfully played, but Ehle and Firth are brilliant. Although Elizabeth's ability to judge people needs seasoning, she's smart, strong-willed, and impossible to intimidate. No flighty girl is she. Darcy is brutally honest, scrupulously principled, impatient with frivolity and nonsense, and proud. Since much of the age was frivolous and nonsensical, he often doesn't fit in socially. Not to put too fine a point on it, he can be positively boorish. One of P&P;'s most humorous scenes is the first time Elizabeth and Darcy dance together at a formal ball hosted by Bingley. It gives new meaning to the word ""discomfiture"". I found two other characters particularly intriguing, Mr. Collins (David Bamber) and Bingley's unmarried sister (Anna Chancellor). The former, a simpering and oily Anglican cleric and Mr. Bennet's nephew, stands to inherit the Bennet house at its master's death. Moreover, in his relations with his own wealthy patron, the insufferable Lady Catherine de Bourgh (Barbara Leigh-Hunt), the pathetic and disgusting Collins raises obsequious bootlicking to an artform. Chancellor's character was that of a spiteful spinster-to-be who could've run circles around any Hollywood gossip columnist in terms of pure cattiness.I suspect the costuming and choreography of P&P; are commendably accurate representations of the period, although I'm uniquely unqualified to make that judgement. And then, of course, there's the beautiful English countryside to which I yearn to return after an absence of several years.Though it's definitely a ""chick flick"", a man should be able to find merit in P&P; so long as his testosterone level isn't spilling over. I enjoyed it immensely. But you'll never get me to admit it in the company of my male pals."	5.0	Courtship rituals in Merry Old England	2002-08-07	10	8	2

HUGE difference! it looks and sounds wonderful! (why isn't the 1995 sense and sensibility out in BR?) the only few things that keeps this from being perfect is a) near the end when Mr. Darcy and Ms. Bennet are walking and finally 'hook up' as the kids say - the blu-ray goes down to VHS for like three minutes...then the scene ends, and it's back to blu-ray- and B)The features are a little weak...mainly when they talk w/ the cast...they don't get Jennifer or Colin, and we have a 'tour' with 'Mary and Mr.Wickam'. wtf?

Now I can't decide if I like this version or the movie better! Both were excellent. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle did a great job and Mr. Darcy and Lizzie Bennet, and the whole thing was very well casted, acted out, and produced. I didn't care for Bingly's sister at all-she seemed over-done-but besides that it was perfect.One other thing that I liked was you could see Darcy's character growth, and because you actually see things that are only talked about. Such as Jane's trip to London, Wickham's attempted elopement with Darcy's sister, and Darcy's search for Wickham and Lydia in London.At first I wasn't sure if I liked it because I didn't have the dramatic and romantic proposals that the movie has, but the more I think about the more I like it. The mini series followed the book very well and the dramatized proposals of the movie aren't accurate.

It's true to the time, and there's no sex or yucky stuff, if you know what I mean. Sometimes in these movies, they make the movie more modern, and it makes it unrealistic.  The production of this film was very accurate and hardly missed anything in the book.  The dialect is taken directly from the book.Right away, I fell in love with Colin Firth.  He's handsome, and plays the part of Mr. Darcy exactly the way I would expect him to.Over the weekend, sometimes I like to splurge, and I watch all 6 episodes.  It takes alllll day to do, but I love it.  I would recommend watching one episode each night, that way it won't be too much at a time.Over all, this mini series was GREAT!

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AG6UKXPTE6B4H	Juliette	If you want to watch Pride and Prejudice, then this is by far the best version.  Jane Austen wrote a great novel, with fantastic prose and this production does it justice.It was a BBC series, and because it ran for a full hour (no commercials on the BBC!) for six weeks, you'll need to put aside 6 hours or split it up to watch it, but is really worth your time.  It is very close to the original book.  Albeit Mr D'Arcy did not swim across the pond in the book, but after seeing Colin Firth come out of the water, you'll consider this a worthwhile deviation of the original....swoon!!The acting is excellent, and everything about it from the costumes to the locations are fantastic.  It is sumptuous.  I'd agree that when compared side by side, the VHS version bathes it in a lovely glow as the color is much warmer.I prefer Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as D'Arcy and Lizzy; the chemistry is excellent and perfect for the Regency era.  The looks they share across the piano are so charged.  Keira Knightley was too modern in her portrayal and the way her mouth quirks all over the place during intense moments drives me crazy.  I found the scene in the rain where D'Arcy proposes to Knightley with all the dark eye make-up totally ridiculous ad they tried to make it more modern which didn't work.  The BBC version follows the book almost verbatim and it is so satisfying to watch all that passion lying just under the surface.I'd absolutely recommend this version.  If it is too expensive here, look on ebay, but personally I feel it is worth every penny.Don't forget to re-read the book though.	5.0	Excellent - much better than the Keira Knightley movie	2008-07-16	5	5	0

I tried going back and watching it a second time, but I still felt the same as I did the first time.  I really feel that Lizzy was miscast, she just didn't give off that fiery spirit that makes Lizzy so loveable and endearing.  She was nothing like the Lizzy I imagined.  Jane, the beauty of the Bennet family, was extremely plain.  Lydia and Mrs. Bennet were terrible actresses, grating at my nerves every minute they were on-screen, and even Colin Firth (who I usually like) was practically a robot.  In many places the dialogue was over-simplified and dumbed-down.  Many little details (which have major meaning) from the book were left out.  While this version is extremely close to the events in the book, I felt that the passion and chemistry between Lizzy and Mr. Darcy just wasn't there (and this was a MAJOR point for me... they just ooze passion and chemistry in the book), and I also think the same goes for the Jane/Bingley relationship.Both the scenery and the costumes are beautiful, but I much prefer the 2005 and 1940 versions (even with all of their inaccuracies, I feel the acting was much better.  Knightly and MacFadyen, to me, had great chemistry, as did Greer Garson and Lawrence Olivier.

Pride and Prejudice is one of the most amazing novels of the english language. This version done by the BBC (homeland of Jane Austen!!!) is the best out of the several hollywoodized attempts to capture Austen's magic. Though the Laurence Olivier version is tolerable, this BBC version follows the book the closest and is truest costume and style. I believe if Jane Austen were around today she would want her Mr. Darcy to be played by Colin Firth.  (On that note, let me say that Colin Firth is positively goregous and never looks better then he does in this film, and he is quite attractive in the Bridget Jones Diary movies, also a Mr. Darcy.) This is one of the most romantic and fantastic novels and flims ever. I would highly reccomend this to anyone who is intrested in Austen, classic literature, or is sucker for romance and wit (and Colin Firth)!	5.0	The most amazing film version of a fantastic book.	2006-09-07	8	7	1

It is a truth universally acknowledged!!! :o)  This adaptation has achieved cult-worship status online and beyond, evidenced by the birth and growth of a major Jane Austen discussion site originally conceived in its honor.  In the eight years between my first reading of Pride &amp; Prejudice and my first viewing of this wonderful adaptation, I built up a good many mental images as to what the characters should look like, how the scenes should be blocked out, and how the various locations should appear.  Amazingly enough, this miniseries duplicated almost PRECISELY every detail I'd imagined!  It really makes you fall in love with the story...whether you're an old P&amp;P fanatic or a complete Austen 'virgin,' you'll stay up all hours of the night to finish watching the whole thing!!!  Before long, you'll find yourself quoting the characters and using &quot;Austenspeak&quot; involuntarily!  On a more personal note, my obsession with this production got me involved with a myriad of other fans from all over the world, and reignited my latent Austen fascination.

Anderson ""bromfieldhall"""	I can't say I've ever enjoyed a Jane Austen adaptation as much as this one in my entire life!  The whole series is an absolute delight from start to  finish.Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle portray the lead characters of Mr.  Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett perfectly.  Never has Lizzie been so pretty,  witty or charming nor has Darcy ever been so brooding, mysterious or  handsome as in this series.  The chemistry between the leads is electric  and the sparks certainly fly in one of the best romantic love stories ever  told.The fact that the writer's have taken the step of showing more of a  background for Darcy also helps the viewer appreciate what a good and kind  man he really is all along, rather than, as in other adaptations, he  appears to suddenly change into being nice.The casting of Julia Sawahla  as the selfish, stupid Lydia Bennett was also inspired.  She carried off a  difficult role so well that in the end you still have to like her for all  her faults.As for the rest of the cast - there wasn't one that let the  series down one tiny bit.  Notably, David Bamber as Mr. Collins was  suitably sweaty and snivelling, Alison Steadman as Mrs. Bennett was  fantastically highly strung, Adrian Lukis as Wickham was a suave villan and  Anna Chancellor's, Miss. Bingley was deliciously nasty.If I could give  the rating more stars I would.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A23U1F7I0UYE7X	Karen	I'm a huge Jane Austen fan, both book and movie versions of her work.  My two favorite movies are Emma and Sense and Sensibility, which are sweet and romantic but not necessarily true to the book.  This movie surpasses both of them! I watched it twice, then the next day I watched certain scenes, and then the whole thing again! It's that good.I could repeat the same praise other readers have shared, because the characters are perfectly right, the settings and costumes are lush and the script is just a delight.  I especially liked the embarrassing, fickle Mrs. Bennett and the bowing, stupid Mr. Collins.  Every sister was instantly recognizable as someone you knew! Lydia was well done as a giggling, boy-crazy apple-of-her-mother's-eye. And Mr. Bennet had the best wry sense of humour. He was teasing his high-strung wife constantly, but it went over her head every time.But the best part of this adaption, I believe, was the tender way the director allowed the story to unfold, slowly.  There were whole dances, not just 10 seconds.  The sexual tension of the Lizzy-Darcy relationship was brought out carefully.  At first I didn't like Darcy at all.  It was only through a series of conversations, lingering looks, even flashbacks, that the main characters' hearts were revealed. I think the casting director picked these two gems (Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle) not just for their acting but also because of their (&quot;fine&quot;) eyes...demure and curious in Elizabeth, brooding and expressive in Darcy. In the end I'd fallen in love with both of them myself!A second viewing showed details you won't get with a 2 hour movie.  For example, Darcy makes a passing remark about well-read women (as a small compliment to Lizzy, who's of course a bookworm).  In a few minutes, the snobbish Caroline Lucas is seen parading around in front of the group, trying in vain to get interested in a book in her hands.  Finally she throws it aside and goes back to her favorite past-time, cutting people down. Excellently done!The 6 hours will just fly by!

In the old DVD version, the scenery and characters were either yellowed, or completely washed out. With the new Blue-Ray however, the details and colors are so sharp and vidid, they literally pop out at you.  I was able to notice even the smallest of details, from the small flowers on Mrs. Bennett's gown, to the links in the chain around Elizabeth's neck.  According to the extras included, the Blue-Ray version was restored from the movie negatives themselves, allowing us to see everything exactly as the director intended, making the time and effort they put into this restoration well worth it.

Fogliani-Ahmed"""	Even though I confess I have not read any of the works of Jane Austen, I can still appreciate something that is obviously good literature, with incomparable richness of language; and that is here paired in a movie series unlike any other before and for future years to come as well.Jennifer Ehle in her role of Elizabeth Bennett has all the charm, wit and articulation that is appropriately required, and so does the proud Mr. Darcy, played by whom I consider one of the most good-looking and most eloquent British actors of the day: Colin Firth. When I saw him in &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot;  I noticed his gift to play his characters in a silent way, where whether no spoken words may be necessary, his body language speaks volumes. Alison Steadman deserves an award for her performance of the annoying Mrs. Bennett; just as her husband, played by Benjamin Whitrow, makes himself dear to us all in his role as head of a family with the responsibility of having to care for them as both mother and father.And Pemberley! Well, one can only gasp - just as Elizabeth does, when she sees the old English mansion from the angle of her chariot to find it purely breathtaking.This is a fine production where not only the great storyline deserves watching but the details of the costumes, the city life, the countryside and, yes, the manners of the time make it worthwhile to watch time and time again.

For purists it is the closest version to the book the acting is excellent. Colin Firth is amazing and Miss Ehle Is so beautiful, she looks like a Dresden Doll.... though she smiles a little too much which made her look a little too coy for my taste. What bothered me most however is that parts of the movie look very faded...  I have to say I like  the spirit and vibrancy of the Kiera Knightly version much better. Perhaps it is because that is the first adaptaion I viewed. I own both however both are very much worth seeing, go well together hand in hand.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1PBNJJZ4NQYIL	Kate Preston	I have watched this mini-series countless times and for me,it is by far the best adaption of Pride and Prejudice . The series really captures the comedy of manners of Jane Austens novel that the recent adaption lacks. The acting is superb as well as the music, costumes and locations. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are excellent as Elizabeth and Darcy respectivly and have great chemistry.I also enjoy the portrayal of Mr Bennett,whose humor has been transfered very well onto the screen. The 300 minute length may put some people off, but for me, it is thouroughly enjoyable throughout and by the end, I am always left wanting more! The new movie starring Kiera Knightley,  while also very good, simply does not compare to this wonderful adaption.	5.0	Perfect!	2006-07-27	5	5	0

The classic Jane Austen story is brought to life by A&E; in a very comprehensive portrayal of the novel. It is long and, in some parts, cumbersome, but this series really fleshes out the novel in a way that a movie cannot. It certainly develops the characters fully and, I find a more believable Lizzy and a more dynamic Pemberly.The recent Movie is a quick gloss over of a very complicated story.

Robertson	I just saw the 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice last night and it made me appreciate the 1996 version even more. If you have read the book, perhaps more than once as I have, then you will love this version because this film captures the characters, the rules of society, the style of living, as they were described in the book. There are a few minor liberties but they add to the story. The acting was superb. The characters in the book lived in a very polite, very reserved society and these actors were able to convey so much with a glance, a gesture, a stiffening of the shoulders. I will admit that I was already a fan but never more so than after viewing the new, and dreadful version. If you are going to buy a DVD of Pride and Prejudice this is the one.	1.0	Still the best!	2006-03-09	20	6	14

Who is this man?  When I realized he was Mr. Darcy in Pride &amp; Prejudice I had to have it.  I was not disappointed!  I have never seen a man who could say so much with his eyes.  We come to know Mr. Darcy very well, as we see him in many situations, more so than in the book!  But it works for me.  Jennifer Ehle did a good job, but Colin Firth stole the show!

This isn't a big deal, but I you have watched the series as often as I have it is a nice touch. For example at the beginning of the film viewers will now see a a quick shot of Mrs. Bennet talking excitedly to her friends then she will tell her family the news that a Mr. Bingly will be leasing Netherfield. It doesn't impact the story, but for fans like me it is a lovely touch.	5.0	Wonderful transition to blueray- must have for fans of the series	2010-05-30	2	2	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AZOH8BIMG2AYD	Kathleen	"An excellent 6 hour version of Austen's novel, with sharply drawn characters and a broad sweep of life within the landed gentry. The gradual attitude shifts in the main characters are sometimes glossed over without development and are sometimes confusingly portrayed, so some relationship changes seem abrupt. Reading the novel will fill in the gaps. Dialogue is true to the novel without seeming stilted. You will not want to use contractions ever again. The dancing and music are mesmerizing, especially when the dialogue is so beautifully timed with it.  The ""extra features"" advertised on the DVD are minimal - the ""background/making of"" is shallow and shows very little behind the scenes or interviews with main characters."	5.0	Pride and Prejudice - Masterpiece Theater	2008-04-05	1	1	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1M02BIJINGWOB	Kathleen	I don't know how many are like me, intrigued by the new P&P; movie but falling in love with this miniseries instead. I tried to read P&P; before but couldn't finish the first a couple of pages, under a false impression coming from reading the first quarter of sense and sensibility that the heroine in P&P; was also full of vanity and conceit. I was prejudiced too, hehe. So when the new movie came out I went to have a look, wondering why the novel's this popular. The Elizabeth in the movie is lovely, so is Mr. Darcy, but still not good enough to outperform Ehle and Colin whom I discovered in a searching for more P&P; information. Colin Firth's eyes are so expressive, his body language is so subtle, and I doubt anyone can ever replace him as Mr Darcy. I began to re-read the novel after finishing the miniseries due to difficulty of understanding some dialogues. The heroine in the first half is very self-conscious but acceptable with witty lines here and there. She turns better in the other half where the chemistry starts to make itself apparent and draws all my attention. The hero is absolutely charming, probably because I imaged him as Colin, who is soooooo handsome and cute by the way :), from the very beginning. Unlike the movie, the plot of this miniseries keeps faithful to the novel but still refreshes us with a few new scenes those are absolutely natural and are definitely an enhancement. To those who think the wet shirt makes Darcy sextual and so degrade the taste, please watch it again without any prejudice. I don't see the wet shirt sextually seducing, actually I don't see anything related to sex. I only see a Darcy not surrounded by his pride and vulnerable to love. Oh, I can't tell how ardently I admire and love him! This miniseries is superb and I can watch it again and again and again!The only complain goes to the DVD itself. As many already mentioned, the color fades out, and the warm tone in the original is gone. And the featurette doesn't have many contents, even no interview of the two leading roles! I'm eager to see a new special DVD coming out. Dear A&E;, please give us this relief by bringing back the original color and adding more behind-the-scene's.	5.0	Never bother to register on Amazon before, but take the effort now solely for a comment on this miniseries	2006-02-21	6	5	1

It stays true to the novel while bringing the characters alive. The casting was very well done. I love Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth-they are similar to the way I pictured them when I was reading the book. Also, Mr. and Mrs Bennet and Mr. Collins are hilarious. Although the miniseries is very long, it does not move slowly-there is always something happening. I did not find myself bored at all throughout the entire six hours. In addition, I enjoyed the extra features-specifically the behind the scenes featurette. The only problem I have with the DVD is that the video and sound quality are not the greatest. At several points the timing of the sound is way off. Also, the video quality has occasional lapses. However, these flaws are minor and they are not enough to make me regret buying this DVD. It is one of my favorites-great actors, scenery, and costumes, and it tells the story in a way that Jane Austen herself would be proud of. I recommend this to all people who like the novels of Jane Austen and to anyone else who enjoys romantic and entertaining movies.	5.0	A terrific DVD	2002-04-29	2	2	0

It was absolutely true to the book. Each character is superbly cast, to the point where when re-reading the book, I actually see and hear the characters as portrayed by the actors/actresses in this version. The more recent version with Kiera Knightly might have actually been more realistic as to the setting. It was a shabbier, dirtier rendition that may have been more like the times really were, HOWEVER, that is not what I want to see when viewing this series. The setting, the casting, the screenplay and editing were simply the best of all versions....preceding and succeeding. Jane Austin would be proud.	5.0	Jane Austin would be proud	2012-03-29	4	4	0

Cobb	I have watched several versions of Pride and Prejudice, and loved them all.That being said, this version is by far, the most romantic and exciting of the lot.I am 46 years old, but the repressed sexual tension between Mr. Darcy and Ms. Bennett had my heart racing and my palms sweating like a 16 year old school girl.It brings home the sad fact that I am going to be single for the rest of my life because I will not settle for anything less than my own Mr. Darcy or Mr. Firth for that matter (for me, they are one and the same, no matter how Mr. Firth exclaims that he is not Mr. Darcy).What I found to be the one of the most exquisite scenes was the dancing scene, as Mr. Darcy and Ms. Bennett kept separating and coming together while having an intellectual argument.Equally exquisite was his admission of his admiration for her in his first proposal.Finally, the last scene when Ms. Bennett states her feelings have changed (admitting her love), the look on Mr. Darcy's face as he was trying to appear in control lets you know that this was a man struggling with a passion he could barely contain.Colin Firth is, was, and will always be my own Mr. Darcy.Other great movies with Colin Firth are both Bridget Jones' movies, as well as Girl With a Pearl Earring.	5.0	Looking for Mr. Darcy	2006-05-07	4	3	1

I chose the two-tape version, which I'm not certain amazon.com offers yet.  It is more convenient to watch two tapes instead of six, and I think that the quality of the film is still maintained remarkably well.This is the perfect movie for a rainy day.  It runs 226 minutes and the acting is SUPERB!  I am always entranced by this love story.  I've watched this film, since I bought it in August, at least 4 times.  Elizabeth Bennett is easy to love and respect, and it is so satisfying to watch Mr. Darcy stew and suffer in his pride!  Mr. Bennett, Elizabeth's father, has to be the funniest man in the world.  This tape is worth watching just for his torturous (yet humorous!) remarks to his wife and daughters.  This movie is remarkably true to Austen's work.  A few minor scenes are changed, such as Mr. Collins' final visit to the Bennetts' home and the situation of Colonel Fitzwilliam, but true Jane Austen fans cannot be disappointed.  This movie will make you a Jane Austen fan, if you aren't already.  I love her works because they all seem to have rich, heartwarming endings.  People with serious flaws overcome them for love.  Yes, this is a chick flick.  You will want to strangle Elizabeth's sister Lydia, and you cannot help but fall in love with Mr. Darcy!You will love this film.

I have never seen two characters on film with more spark and chemistry than between Colin Firth's Darcy and Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth. Be warned though, that you may become completely (and for me uncharacteristically) obsessed with Mr. Darcy and by default, Colin Firth. The only quibble I have is the same as that of many other reviewers - once the two finally got together at the end I wish the filmmakers had extended the story a bit more, but that's the way Jane Austen ended it so I guess the film had to as well. Still, one can't help wishing for some sort of a sequel to this film with the same actors, writer and director. Tip: There is a book called &quot;The Making of Pride and Predjudice&quot; which gives really good insights into the characters, especically Mr. Darcy. I found it facinating to read about the hidden motivations and feelings as interpreted by Colin Firth and especially, Andrew Davies, the screenwriter. Really good.

But I was  disappointed with this edition since it follows the mini-series daily chapter breaks (the VHS edition) in lieu of the DVD version where the story flows nearly seamlessly.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AK73KG6Z35CNU	KB	Pride and Prejudice  (Jennifer Ehle, Colin Firth, David Bamber, Crispin Bonham-Carter, Anthony Calf, Anna Chancellor, Susannah Harker, Julia Sawalha, Alison Steadman, Benjamin Whitrow) is utterly absorbing.  Thirty minutes into the film and 190 years melt away with the audience joining Austen's culture that is full obstacles and arcane social rules. Extraordinary acting enlivens this version, making it second only to the book itself. I own the DVD set and have uncharacteristically watched numerous times because of its enchanting power.  The setting is you-are-there perfect from broad swaths of countryside to minute details of household bric-a-brac. The cameras artfully capture the superb, nuanced acting as the extraordinary cast embody Austen's characters. Readers of Austen will appreciate the efforts of the entire production staff as the exquisite, exacting details of architecture, decor, fabrics, clothing, voices and habits will enrich the imagination for all future reading.	5.0	Beyond compare P & P	2007-10-08	4	2	2

Blonde	My favorite thing to do on a rainy weekend is curl up on the couch and transport myself to Jane Austen's world.This particular adaptation of Pride and Predjudice has excellent costumes, beautiful set decorations and supurb casting. Colin Firth *is* Mr. Darcy as far as I'm concerned. The movie is faithful enough to the book for even the most die-hard Austen fan. The parts of Mrs. Bennett and Lydia are so well acted you can feel the embarrassment of Lizzie at her mother and sister's perpetual bad behavior.I love this movie. I do have to agree with other reviewers that the film quality seems a bit poor for a special edition, but it definately doesn't detract at all from this wonderful movie.	5.0	This is my favorite DVD	2004-10-29	9	8	1

Much to my displeasure, however, they returned it to the 6 separate episodes for the 2010 edition, meaning you have to fast forward through the credits at the beginning and end of each hour.  You CAN NOT play it all the way through without the credits interrupting.  The special edition, in comparison, allows you to play the each disk (episodes 1-3 and 4-6) straight through, with the credits playing only at the beginning and end of each disk.You can't jump over the beginning credits, either - you have to fast forward them by hand, because you'll miss the first sixth of that episode if you try to jump to the next scene.Also with the 2010 version, they also put 1-4 on one disk and 5-6 on another, meaning that they broke up my favorite scenes - the visit to Pemberley.  (This is really only a personal preference - but I'm not in the least bit happy about having to get up and change the DVD in the middle of my favorite scenes.)  This to save space on the second disk for a 60 minute extra that involves cast members revisiting memories - the actors playing Mr. and Mrs. Bennett, Mary Bennett, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Wickham (no Darcy or Elizabeth, natch). This was interesting but one I'm unlikely to watch again.  Other extras include information on the technical changes - boring, but does allow you to easily see the difference between versions - as well as bits that I think have been included on other editions - a walk w/ Adrian Lukis and Lucy Briers (Wickham and Mary Bennett) and another piece I haven't watched yet discussing the impact this production had on period productions in general.In general, if you already own P&P; and are satisfied with the version you have - and can deal with the color - then I recommend that you stick with it.  I'll probably continue watching the 2001 special edition to avoid the hassle of fast forwarding credits throughout."	3.0	2010 Restored Edition - You Might Want to Know Before You Buy	2010-05-19	20	15	5

Well, you probably know the answer already, but this 6-hour adaptation of P&P; is really the only version that matters to people who love the book. Others have tried, but fail to capture that is great about the book and its time-tested characters.Colin Firth (who is thinner here) is the handsome controlled Darcy whose pride keeps him from admitting that he loves Elizabeth Bennet even though her family is annoying. Jennifer Ehle is lovely and down to earth and makes one of literature's favorite female characters come to life. Watch as she deftly undercuts Mr. Collins' attempts at matrimony and wields a big stick with Mr. Darcy's attempts as well.Six hours may seem like a lot at first, but you'll be glad you watched this.

This is simply one of the BEST (if not THE best) series I have ever had the privilege to watch (I've probably seen it 75 times).  It is said that a fine piece of art can be looked at over and over, and still you see things you never noticed before.  The story and the depth of the characters, their relationships, are extraordinary.  The acting is awesome--the characters seem so real.  The production and sets have been painstakingly created to live true to the time period.  This movie is a joy to watch--I have so many movies that I have paid upwards of $25 for  that just sit on my shelf and I never look at a second time. This is a a gift that keeps on giving!I owned the non-Blu Ray version as well as the VHS version.  The single, very frustrating problem with the standard DVD is that the DVD transfer quality was horrendous!  Color stauration and clarity were 4th rate.  Good thing the story and production were awesome, so you could almost overlook that.  When I heard that the movie was being re-transferred to Blu-ray, I pre-ordered it 6 months in advance!  The new Blu-ray version  completely lived up to my expectation (I have a dedicated home theater witha 100"" 1080p Sony projector, so I can really discern video quality). This is a 1000% improvement--colors are saturated, image sharp.  While it's not quite up to some of today's eye popping 1080p disks, the overall quality is now first class and unquenstionably worth owning.If you have ANY appreciation for a wonderful story, suberp acting, great screenplay, and fine art, you MUST have this one!"	5.0	What can I say?	2009-05-30	7	7	0

This version is really fantastic. I've read this book several times and this adaptation is very true to the written word. The costumes, scenery, all come to life in this classic tale of misunderstanding and finally, ture love triumphing over all.Elizabeth's likable character is brought to life, as are all of Austen's wonderful characters, all with their own particular foibles.Some of my particular favorites are the Bennett's clerical cousin, an odd-looking fellow, who, in his spare time, composes those little compliments that ladies so love to hear, the Bingly sisters, the eldest, whose angular features are almost as sharp as her tounge, Mrs. Bennett, who is comically annoying and there are many more who make this an engaging telling of Jane Austen's story.I guess I can't overlook Mr. Darcy, played by Colin Firth, who while not my particular cup of tea, does such an excellent job playing the details of Mr. Darcy's pent up feelings of love for Elizabeth and his sheer and utter discomfort during disquieting social situations.Set in the English country side, you'll want to brew a pot of tea for this movie.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1QFM9CFEUXZK5	Kendra	Updated 4/22:  I should completely change my review.  I love this movie, now. . . love it!I have watched this twice more since I wrote this review and also watched the Keira Knightley version again.  Keira Knightley lacked all the cleverness that Jennifer Ehle brought to the role.  Keira was angry all the time and almost unlikeable at all times.  Jennifer was charming and likeable at all times.  This is really one of my favorite films of all time and I'm stunned that I originally thought this.  Did I have too much wine that night? I don't know-- this was such a perfect movie.  I don't think I've ever changed my mind so much about a film EVER.********************************This was my old pathetic review: I realize that this version is more authentic than the Keira Knightly version.  But, that version was much more entertaining. And, even though I don't usually really like Keira Knightly, she was incredibly charming in this particular film.That said, I so wanted to like this! And, based on the reviews, I purchased it.  I'm glad I have it, I guess, but I just now purchased the 1980s version and am looking forward to receiving that.The casting was the big surprise.  Mrs. Bennett was the worst of all. She is supposed to be a bit of a boor, but she is so incredibly shrill, it is fathomable that one will have a headache if the film is viewed in its entirety.  I certainly did. As a matter of fact, it's been a few hours after I've finished the movie and I've had several ibuprofin. My head is still aching.  She was so loud! Her voice was an octave higher than this reviewer's ears could comfortably take and I'm truly surprised that the surrounding glass objects survived in one piece rather than shattering.Jane just was not pretty.  I first saw the actress that played Jane play the reporter in House of Cards-- a first rate British drama starring Ian Richardson. My husband and I remarked her likeness to Princess Diana. Yet, she isn't that pretty. She's attractive, but not pretty and definitely not the beauty Jane is supposed to be.  Her neck is freakishly thick and she lacks grace.  In this film, she can't even pass as prettier than average.  At the risk of being just a bit too picayune, had they done something a bit better with her hair-- maybe pulled it less tightly from the back, have the front hang a bit lower, she may have passed as more attractive, but there was nothing about her in the least attractive and I'm more than surprised at the choice of casting here.Lizzie was far prettier if a bit zaftig.  Strangely enough, during the last scene of the first dvd, she was markedly thinner and her collarbones actually protruded a bit. I bet that was the final scene filmed. However, during the rest of both the first dvd and the entire second dvd, she must have weighed 20 pounds more than she probably should have and it showed.  Still, she was very pretty and grew prettier by the time the film was over. But, she seemed a bit older than she should have been and she seemed a bit matronly for the role. Here, I'm not criticizing her weight at all-- by 'matronly', I mean her demeanor. She didn't appear charming or childlike when playing with the dogs or running in the fields. She didn't seem like a young and single woman at almost any time-- she seemed older in demeanor and appearance.Bingley's sister wore WAY too much makeup for her role and looked like  a French courtesan.  I'm shocked at this choice, too. She was the only woman in the entire film to be made up this way and it was a very poor choice.Lydia was absolutely appalling. She lacked even an iota of charm. She is physically unattractive and so entirely annoying to watch.  To get away with what she got away with in the story, there has to be SOMETHING appealing about her and there wasn't anything appealing about her here.  She did not have to be pretty, but she should have been a little cute-- something.  She was just a disgusting character from beginning to end. Had the actress that played Kitty actually played Lydia, that would have been more successful.Collins was a joke. The Collins in the Keira Knightly version was wonderful. His pretension actually had a bit of charm-- not enough to want to spend any time with him, mind you.  Still, if one is to see these characters in a real light, they have to have some dimension to them. The Collins in this film did not. The Collins in the other film did.The rest of the casting was superb. Crispin Bonham-Carter was perfect as was Colin Firth. When he lost some of his reserve one could truly see the charm under there.  His take on the role was very good.I wonder if I should have waited to review this until after I watch the  80s version I just ordered, but reviewing this one without the benefit of comparison has merit, too, I believe.The newer and less faithful version with Keira Knightly was much more enjoyable, even if liberties were taken. Both Lizzie and Jane were perfectly cast, as were all the sisters.  The mother, as annoying as Mrs. Bennet could possibly be, was at least not repulsive. One didn't absolutely hate her as they did in this version, even if one couldn't find too much likeable about her.Donald Sutherland did not seem too old for this part as I saw mentioned in other reviews. He always appears youthful to me-- even as his hair turns completely gray.  He was very good and likeable as was the father in this version, as well.And, what can I say about Matthew Macfadyen who played Mr. Darcy? He was completely wonderful. Fabulous, really. Colin Firth was good, too, mind you, but Matthew Macfadyen portrayed Mr. Darcy perfectly.The ending in this film was almost superb. Not so in the Keira Knightly version, which seemed completely overdone.  Here, we got a quick view of everyone else in the film before the final scenes with Lizzie, Jane, Darcy and Bingley.  That was perfect as those scenes played out over the sermon given by the pastor.  Perfect ending.	5.0	updated and deserving of 5 stars. . .	2008-02-24	17	5	12

I have to agree that it is by far, my favorite of all movies, and I like a goodly spectrum.  It is right up there with the likes of Gone With the Wind, and Casablanca.  I particualarly like this version BETTER than the one just out on video from the theaters with Keira Knightly.  I find the characters are easier to get to know and understand better, particularly because more time is spent on developing them.  I am so thrilled by the excellent work of the actors portraying their individual roles.  My favorite is Mr. Bennet.  He is much more personable and we can see his relationship with his daughter much better in this version.  I also just giggle with delight at the utter repulsiveness of Mr. Collins in this version.  He plays this part perfectly and believably.  I think those type of characters are more difficult to portray, but David Bamber does an excellent job.  This version has a different atmosphere than the shorter, newer released version.  The settings and costumes are on a more 'upscale' feel for portraying the more common garb of the day.  If you are trying to decide which version to buy, I am confident in telling you that you would much prefer this BBC/A&E version.  Buy it without regret and ENJOY!!!	5.0	Best Version	2006-02-20	5	4	1

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A13R83PDZ5QIQL	Kevin Lauderdale	Comparing the original DVD with the Special Edition, we see1) That the show was originally shot for the BBC at about 1.78, NOT the 2.35 that the box says.  As a result, those of us in the U.S. who watched it on A&E;, and who bought the first DVD release (OR:  original release) saw a Pan and Scan version of it.  Not by much, grant you, but enough.  By flipping back and forth between both versions of the DVD, you can see that the frame on the OR is a little crowded, parts of people are cropped off, etc.  You get the full image, as intended to be seen, with the SE.2)The image quality of the OR was lousy!  Artifacts everywhere ... looked like a bad video tape.  The SE produces a much higher resolution image.  Still not as good as we would like, but better than any other incarnation of P&P; on home video.  But...3) That image is a little washed out.  Luckily, all you have to do is turn up the color (on my Panasonic, the color is usually set at 18.  Doubling that brought nice, rich colors), and you get a very nice image.I love the SE.	5.0	Pride Prejudice *Special Edition* DVD review	2002-05-01	10	10	0

I missed the first episode in the earlier time slot, so I stayed up to watch it in the later time slot, I think it began at around ten or eleven.  I was  only 16 so my mom came down to yell at me for not being in bed, but within  five minutes she was hooked and we watched the rest of it together.

Now, put him in the best movie and character role that you can put him in and you have the best Mr. Darcy you could ever have.  In the beginning, he is so mean and disdainful to Lizzy.  She bears it well, but holds her own with him.  I love the fact that every Austen woman is equally matched to her man and Lizzy and Darcy are definitely matched well.  Every time he says something to her, she comes right back at him with something even more clever than what he has already said.  I love the part where he takes her hand for the first time and helps her in the carriage.  It is a spark worthy moment and just makes me sigh with longing every time I see it.  Of course, I wish there was more kissing between these characters when they finally get together, but just watching Darcy stare at Elizabeth while she is at the piano with his sister just makes me melt into a puddle every time.  If you are a romantic and want to show your man the romantic, beautiful Austen woman you are inside, then show him Darcy and explain to him in simple terms how it makes you feel.  I'm sure your hot man will show you some love and affection worthy of the man that we all look for, our own Mr. Darcy (sigh)!!  If you have found your Darcy, hold on to him and if you haven't (like me), keeping looking.  Until you find him, keep this movie close by and you will feel like he is near!!  Enjoy the Firth as he works his magic as Darcy and watch Lizzy capture his heart over and over again!!	5.0	Collin Firth as Darcy, need I say more!!!	2010-01-30	2	2	0

Oh, there are great movies made of books, but this is a true screen adaptation that follows the novel quite closely.Adapting a Jane Austen novel can't be easy. So much of the interaction between characters isn't in dialogue, but in description, yet the writers, cast and crew of this A&E; production did an outstanding job. Simon Langton directed beautifully, and there aren't enough words to describe the praise I would like to offer Colin Firth, Jennifer Ehle and the rest of the cast.Two cast members who never get as much praise as they deserve for this work as David Bamber and Alison Steadman. Bamber's portrayal of Mr. Collins, the obsequious cousin, is beyond compare and Steadman's vision of Mrs. Bennett couldn't be more spot on.At first, I was content to borrow this from a friend on VHS, but after a single viewing, I had to own the DVD. Probably the best value I've ever had for my entertainment dollar as I watch this mini-series repeatedly.The sets and locations are astounding...well, I could go on and on. Please do read the novel, if you haven't already. I definitely won't say that the mini-series surpasses the novel, because I don't think that it does, but it certainly does it justice.The film verion of ""Sense and Sensibility"" was very well done.

It is suberb.  Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle top the list of ""everyone in this thing was perfectly cast!""

Instantly I became her huge fan,I love and enjoy the story very much, and p&p truly is Jane Austen's masterpiece.  As soon as I found out they have made this story into a movie, I eagerly searched for it.  I have watched four different versions(1940 Laurence Oliveier version, 1980 David Rintonl version, 1996 Colin firth and Jennifer Ehle version, 2005 Keira Knightley version, and I have to say this one by far is the best of the all.  I rarely watch any movie twice in a short period of time, but this one I cannot remember how many times I have watched in a week.  It was really a pleasure though, Colin Firth's execution in this movie was brilliant, and he brings out a live Mr.  Darcy, I cannot imagine any better Darcy than this, he touched my heart.  Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth Bennet was well played too, each time when I re-watched the movie I love her more and more.  Besides leading characters, all the other supporting actors in this movie were carried out their roles wonderfully, and that contributed a great deal to the movie.  If you love the book, this movie is must seen, and I highly  recommend this movie to anyone who likes classic romance storys.	5.0	Beautiful story, Clear pictures, and Wonderful cast	2009-10-17	0	0	0

In spite of the fact that Colin Firth plays Mr. Darcy, the movie, while beautiful, lacks a certain spark.  Some of the scenes seem quite drawn out and there is no passion to be felt.  I much prefer Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley where emotion, tension and passion leap from the screen and one cannot help but be drawn into the story itself.  Darcy is excellent, as is the entire cast.  Truly a much better version in every way.  And for fun be sure not to miss Lost in Austen where someone from our time travels to Ms. Bennet's time.  It's wonderful and so much fun.  As for this version...I'd skip it and go for the other two.	3.0	Hmmmm	2012-07-15	12	0	12

I should complain about the film grain that now appears because of the clarity of the Blu-ray media, or that there are some artifacts visible in some scenes, but this is simply modern media surpassing the film and mastering that the original film was produced on in 1995.

The quality of the DVD is far improved over the VHS edition, and it is well to note that it will not erode over time as does tape.Jennifer Ehle is exquisite in her role as Elizabeth. She is fascinating to watch as she unfolds her own pride and predjudice toward an erstwhile suitor whom she secretly loves but cannot allow herself to admit. What can anyone say about the wonderful actor Colin Firth, but praise?  He is a powerful, virile and elegant Mr. Darcy. The onscreen chemistry between these two actors, Firth and Ehle is palpably remarkable.  To this viewer the only character who is over the top is her shrieking mother Mrs. Bennett.  There are a few moments when she is so intense that the mute button on the remote control is essential. The actor who portrays the pompous, officious Mr. Collins is simplyoutstanding in his role as is the balance of the cast who bring to life a story and the many quirks of character, personality and the motives that drive each of them.All in all, the DVD is a cherished addition to a select archive of favorite films that are reviewed every 6 months or so for another hit of Colin Firth.	5.0	Colin Firth is the Man!	2001-12-12	4	4	0

Don't get me wrong, there are a few places where the story deviates from the book, but these places are few and far between.Jennifer Ehle plays an excellent Elizabeth Bennet, with all the wit and compassion one who has read the book would expect.  And Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy is the best I've ever seen, and I've seen many.I would definitely recommend this to romance-lovers and Austen-lovers alike!	5.0	One word...wow!	2002-08-10	0	0	0

This classic must be seen in Blu-ray. You will be thrilled with the quality. This Blu-ray probably sets the standard for the re-mastering of ""old"" films.A&E; did an outstanding job on this blu-ray format which was first released in April 2009. It was re-issued in 2010 with the only difference being the cover art. So, if you're confused by the different packaging, don't be. The quality and features on the 2010 blu-ray are the same as the 2009 version. The 2009 blu-ray has Colin Firth pictured prominently on the cover with Jennifer Ehle and Susannah Harker sitting in the back.Pros:Quality: The 2 disc blu-ray offers enhanced picture clarity, natural and rich colors and superior sound. The English countryside, costumes, and settings were simply stunning and were meant to be viewed in this manner. The viewing experience was so improved it was like watching an entirely different film.SUBTITLES: The English subtitles are right on the dvd menu and are optional for both the film and extra bonus features.Bonus features: Since thousands have already written positive reviews on the 1995 film, there's nothing unique to contribute here. The 4 extra features were also enjoyable to watch. They are worth mentioning again for the sake of convenience.Lasting ImpressionsA Walkabout with Adrian Lukis (Mr. Wickham) and Lucy Briers (Mary Bennett)Pride and Prejudice: A Turning Point for Period DramaTechnical RestorationPrice: Fortunately, the price has dropped dramatically over the years.

The actors and actresses were properly hand picked for each character. I am not sure how many times I've viewed this in the past. But it is worth seeing this again and maybe again after that.The enchantment of the music and scenery has been the reason at times for me wanting to see it again just to relax with it on an overcast day.I really did not like the more recent one nor did I `get' it.

If you feel at all like a 19th century person in a 20th century world, this will be the film for you. For  serious fans of period movies, this is an excellent choice. It is mainly an  aesthetic film: beautiful people, lovely costuming, breathtaking scenery.  Quite a juxtaposition to the actors in the modern version of  'Persuasion'--they were not as pretty as the actors in this film, so if it  is realism in actors that you are after, this is not the movie. However, it  does shed some interesting light into the social customs of the day:  entailments, the social class structure Jane Austen is concerned with,  propriety,  early 19th century marriage customs, and some excellent views  into relationships. I highly recommend it. It's not necessary to watch the  whole thing at one sitting--as a person with a busy life (as we all have!),  I watch them one at a time, and in any order I please.	5.0	In vain you struggle not to buy this,but it will not do!	1999-12-10	5	5	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A26KIF01GEUXBT	Kyle Pratt	"This superb A&E;/BBC mini-series is an adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel.  While all Austen novels revolve around the universally acknowledged truth that, ""a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,"" her protagonists are always of the fairer sex.  In Pride and Prejudice Elizabeth Bennet (Jennifer Ehle) supplies that protagonist, and the prejudice.  The pride comes from Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) who finds Elizabeth attractive and intelligent but beneath him.Jane Austen novels are set at a slower time and written for people who had the time to read them.  They are leisurely affairs to be read over days.  Therefore, no 90 to 120 minute movie can adequately capture the depth of her genius.  That is why I enjoy this two disk, 300 minute, mini-series.  Although the opening scene is not in Austen's novel, whole pages of text are presented verbatim.The cinematography is good but again the genius of Austen was her presentation of the social and family relationships not the milieu.  The Regency era setting was her world and she made no special effort to describe it.I have reviewed three versions of Pride and Prejudice and can recommend both this miniseries and the 2005 movie with Keira Knightley, but for different reasons.  This mini-series is one of the most faithful adaptations of a novel I have ever seen.  For fans of Jane Austen this is a must have for your collection.Kyle Pratt"	5.0	Faithful Adaptation of Austen's Novel	2006-09-16	9	9	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2W6DWZFENTAM2	Kym	I don't think I'll ever stop praising this film.  Superb in every way imaginable!  What more can I say about Firth and Ehle that hasn't already been said?  Their interpretations of Darcy and Elizabeth are simply  flawless.  Firth managed to take what could have been an insipid character  and turn him into a vibrant, three-dimensional person, while Ehle's  sparkling portrayal of Lizzie Bennet enchanted us all.  To put it modestly,  the supporting cast is brilliant, bringing life even into the smallest  characters (i.e. Emilia Fox's delicate Georgiana Darcy):  Susannah Harker's  grace and serenity made her an absolutely lovely Jane Bennet (IMO, a  perfect portrayal), and her &quot;counterpart&quot; Crispin Bonham-Carter  was every bit as good-looking, and charming as the Charles Bingley we all  know and love (I dare you NOT to smile whenever Bingley's lovesick eyes  surface at even the very mention of Jane!)...Alison Steadman (whose  performance as Mrs. Bennet was so convincing, I had to restrain myself from  tossing my remote control at the screen whenever she complained about her  &quot;poor nerves&quot;), Benjamin Whitrow, Anna Chancellor, Julia Sawalha,  Adrian Lukis (who made the manipulative Wickham so agreeable at the  beginning, it was easy to believe Elizabeth's initial attraction toward the  character), Lucy Briers, Polly Maberly...everybody was amazing.Of  course, the acting is not the film's only strong point.  One of the  highlights of the film was Darcy and Lizzie's dance to &quot;Mr.  Beveridge's Maggot&quot; at the Netherfield ball.  Such delicacy in the  atmosphere made the sharp conversation between the two characters stand out  even more.  It's a great scene, fabulously shot, great choreography with  beyond-wonderful music playing in the background. As for the writing,  Andrew Davies took Jane Austen's book and adapted it for screen without  sacrificing any of the wit, and vivacity that the original work had (since  a large amount of the dialogue was taken straight from Austen's pages I can  really hear the characters speaking whenever I read the book).  The  marvelous score by Carl Davis (oh, how fitting were the chords of Lady  Catherine de Bourgh's &quot;theme&quot;!) and beautiful costumes (Dinah  Collin and Kate Stewart) also add to the film's appeal.This is by all  means a must-see (if not a must-have:) for all Jane Austen fans, and for  moviegoers in general.  You will never spend six hours in a more wonderful  manner.	5.0	Five stars?  That's not enough!	2000-06-27	24	24	0

All the great scenes are there, and they stay quite true to the book.The wit and humour are spot on.  The actors do a good job in portraying the tumult of emotions that are present in each character... the confusion, the hurts, the denial of emotions, the desire, the disappointments....If you're doing a book-report and don't have the time to read the actual book, this is the best version for you.If you love the book, you've probably already seen this version on A&E; and are just trying to buy it for the best price.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A100TW8FZECWD6	"L4d ""l4d"""	"My family has a rule that, if we rent a movie 3 times, we might as well buy it. I had gone far beyond my limit with the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. I could watch this series at least once a month, maybe even once a week, and still love it. The adaptation isn't 100% faithful to the book, but, cinematically, it's by far the best version ever made. On a scale of 5 stars for content, I would give this DVD 100.However, I have both of the DVD editions and I don't like the DVD transfer for either one of them.  If I could, each version would rate at nearly -100 stars.For the first set, the one with the cardboard keepcases:1) The sound quality isn't what I've come to expect from a DVD, and parts of the dialogue bottom out on occasion.2) My local Blockbuster had the two-tape VHS version, with all the credits taken out except at the beginning and end of the set. This made the series flow like one movie, save for the natural break at the climax of the story when Darcy 1st proposes to Eliza, which was wonderful--perfect timing! Since I didn't see the series when it aired on A & E, it was often difficult for me to tell where the series breaks had taken place. I was quite surprised when I learned where some of them were, and this attests to the skill of the editors of the two-tape VHS version. I find the constant credits on the DVD distracting, repetitious and boring; pressing the Next button is inconvenient. As for these credits providing a break, as suggested by another reviewer--come on! DVDs are fantastic at picking up exactly where one left off, without missing a beat. They're far better at it than VHS tapes. If I need to go to the bathroom or get another tub of popcorn that badly, I'd rather stop a DVD wherever I please, rather than waiting for the appearance of credits I don't want to see anyway. That's as bad as watching the prison known as TV (UGH).3) I also find this a very chintzy DVD--no language selections, no subtitles, no ""goodies,"" such as cast bios. It didn't even have closed-captioning! Very, very cheap. As much as my husband paid for this DVD as a Hanukkah present to me, I expected much more for his money. So now I'll search for the VHS version I prefer. Maybe I'll buy two, in case one wears out.For the second set, the one with the plastic keepcases:A&E; finally gets their head outta their youknowwhattee and gives us non-stop storytelling along with some cool goodies like cast bios, widescreen and subtitles/captioning.  Then they RUIN it all with the most hideous color transfer I've ever seen on a DVD.  I had to spend over half an hour getting the picture even remotely bearable to my eyes, and I'm still not satisfied with it.  The entire DVD is now unwatchable for this alone.  Will someone at A&E; please please PLEASE fix this?As I stated in my original review, perhaps the producers of this series will heed the many complaints they've received about the DVD transfers and re-issue a much better version in the future."	4.0	Great mini-series; lousy DVD	2000-12-28	2	2	0

There is a reason why this A and E home production was and is still their most successful production.  The cast could not have been improved upon, and it is true, you will be longing for your own Mr Darcy by film's end.  Jennifer Ehle brings the character of Elizabeth Bennett to life and is so believable, you will wish it never ended.  You actually want to be her, transported back in time, to experience her courage, wit and growth as a young woman yourself. I won't go into a synopsis on the movie, for there are far too many already and I could hardly improve on them, but I cannot say enough about this film. If you see any version at all, make it this one.

Curious, I compared the sound on both the taped and the DVD (both the Special Edition and the 10th Anniversary Collector's Set). Neither I nor my lady friend noticed any sound problem and we're very picky about such details.We did see the same bluer color tone as ""a viewer"" on the DVDs, however. My friend (a professional photographer) changed the COLOR TEMPERATURE from HIGH to 5700K (a warmer tone). She also changed COLOR (saturation) from 50% to 75%. This fixed the problem to our satisfaction. After seeing the movie, we had to change the color back. This is not a flaw we care about, especially since it takes just a few button pushes. While we'll watch the DVD version again (and again) it's unlikely we'll do it more than once a year!The color flaw is a small price to pay for what we got on the 10th anniversary Collector's Set. Since all that is well described elsewhere, I'll only mention one item I especially loved - the 120-page beautiful color-illustrated MAKING OF book. The interview with Colin Firth is fascinating. So was the decription of how the screenwriter Andrew Davies handled the various problems of adapting the book, such as how he made the numerous essential letters visual.I also own the Keira Knightley version of P&P.; I like it equally well, for different reasons.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AVXCC1KLGRFCN	LA Filmmaker	I was quite excited about the prospect of acquiring the exceptional A&amp;E mini-series, &quot;Pride and Predjudice&quot; on DVD -- that is, until I read several Amazon customer reviews commenting on the inferior  quality of the video transfer to DVD.  Some people even suggested that the  VHS tape version of the film was superior in quality to the DVD.  So, after  absorbing these less-than-stellar technical reviews, I balked.  But, after  further consideration, I decided the convenience of DVD's convenient format  would offset any lack of quality that had been forecast by other fans of  the mini-series.  Drum roll please... The two DVD set (in a nice slip-cover  box) arrived and, to my surprise, picture, sound and technical aspects of  the DVD are all excellent, with very little about which to quibble.  (I do  not have a Dolby Digital configuration, but rather the earlier-generation  Pro-Logic set-up, which worked fine, with all of its channels carrying  clear sound elements.)  Although there are no cool supplemental materials  save the excellent chapter index (which provides a wonderful means by which  to pick-up where one left off) our family has been thoroughly engrossed in  the mini-series once again, only this time we're seeing it presented at a  quality level rivaling that of the original broadcast on A&amp;E.  (One  reviewer complained that the front and end credits bracketing each of the  episodes were an unwelcome distraction.  A reminder, though, that these  credits may be easily bypassed by pressing the &quot;NEXT&quot; button on  the remote; doing so jets the viewer to the first frame of the next  installment with nary a glitch.  No problem at all.)  Aside from an  occassional visual ripple effect that can be attributed to normal film  tranfer anomolies, the presentation is simply exquisite.  Remember, this  project was mounted years ago, across the pond, under less-than-perfect  production conditions.  For what it is, its quality and its fit and finish  are completely satisfying to this demanding viewer.  I produce film,  television and video projects at a major studio level for a living, so I  feel qualified to recommend this DVD to anyone who loves Jane Austin and  anyone who's looking for a wonderful presentation of one of her most  beloved stories.  Don't hesitate to order this one!  Amazon's standard  delivery was here within 4 days of my order.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A24J51JDRG8G3B	Laura	If you are wondering, like I did, whether this Keepsake edition could truly be any different from the standard bluray that came out a few years ago, I can tell you that it is (at least, it is different from the UK bluray version that I have). I didn't think it was possible to improve on the bluray, but somehow they did. If you have ever seen the before and after of a restored painting, that's the best analogy I can make. The colors are quite vibrant, and the details really jump out--things I've never noticed before. The bonus features are also new. Some former cast members speak about their experience making P&P (Susannah Harker, David Bamber, Polly Maberly, Adrian Lukis, Lucy Briers, alas, no Colin Firth or Jennifer Ehle).	5.0	Trying to Decide on Keepsake Edition?

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AWWWTMFC24QK7	"Laura Holterman ""Laura Holterman"""	I first saw this fantastic miniseries when I was a freshman in highschool and have been in love with it ever since.  They setting, costumes, and characters were all chosen and cast to perfection.  I espescially loved Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy.  He is such a great actor and he makes you want to hate him for the way he is so snobbish, but yet you still feel sorry for him when Elizabeth rejects him.  Plus he is one sexy guy, and looks really good in his Regency Era clothes.  If you want further proof of what kind of hold this series has over people, my Dad will usually run from the room when he hears or sees anything lovey dovey. But with this movie he actually will sit down and ask about it.  The last time we watched it, he was the first one in front of the tv after dinner!  The only thing I have to say bummed me out was the fact that Jane Austen never wrote a sequel for us to enjoy!	5.0	The Best Pride and Predjudice Ever!!!!	2005-08-11	3	3	0

But it is by far the best, and truest, version out there. Colin Firth plays the perfect Mr. Darcy. I dare anyone to watch this and not fall in love with him. Seriously. It is totally worth the 5 hours. I've seen other versions of P&P, and you don't get the whole story by only watching 2 hours.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3I41MF1O2FAC	"Laura Merucci ""marspeach"""	"This was the first adaptation I saw (almost) in full. I missed some of the first episode. I can't remember exactly what point it was when I first turned it on, but I believe it was the Meryton Assembly. I was so excited to see it because I read the book for the first time shortly before this and only saw the ""WTF"" ending of the 1940 version. I remember seeing a gorgeous brunette and a not so pretty blonde and thought immediately that the former must be Jane, because of her beauty. I wondered if the blonde was Elizabeth or if she was someone else. Then I heard them talking and realized that the beauty was Elizabeth and the ""ugly"" one was Jane! It took a while to get over that initial shock but I managed to enjoy the series all the same. There were (and still are) some parts that still irk me but there's nothing I can do about it, really. I've seen the series quite a few times since I purchased the DVD boxset 4 years ago. That boxset was horrible, by the way. I recently got the new remastered version and it is much better. The colors are so vivid and I can finally see all the beauty of the costumes and the scenery that I didn't before due to the grayed, washed out older DVDs.This is probably one of the, if not THE most famous and popular Jane Austen adaptation ever. Many fans call it definitive. I shudder at any adaptation ever being called definitive, but even if I didn't I would not think this one was! I do appreciate its length and being able to see more of the story than in any of the others (it is longer than the 1980 version as well). It includes more characters and scenes. It is beautiful to look at (as long as you don't have the bad DVD set!), being shot on film and with higher production values than older adaptations had. I like how it followed ""show, don't tell"" throughout even though the timing of some of those ""showings"" bothered me (I'll get into it). It was really funny. It had good acting by some of the cast. And Lizzy has some really beautiful gowns (not so some of the other women).But then there are things that I don't like about it so much. Some of the cast is too old. Many characters are exaggerated even more than in the book and are made into caricatures. For some of them I didn't mind (Mr. Hurst), for others I did mind a lot! (Mrs. Bennet) Andrew Davies, the screenwriter, included a lot of extra Darcy scenes that are not in the book. It was sexed up (mostly, but not only, Darcy), etc. And I don't like that Andrew Davies gives away the book's surprises before the characters learn of them! We hear Darcy narrating his letter to Elizabeth and see flashbacks of its contents before she reads the letter. We see Darcy at Pemberley before Elizabeth does (in the infamous pond scene). And we see him looking for Wickham and Lydia in London and then present at their wedding, before Elizabeth learns of it! Maybe they thought it wasn't important since they figured viewers had already read the book? Most people likely had not (and still haven't) so it irritates me. Could they not have showed those scenes after the fact, as flashbacks? That would have made more sense to me. Does this mean I hate the adaptation? NO! I really don't. I do not mean to bash it and I hope it doesn't sound that way. On my latest viewing, I actually found more to like about it than I did before!If you're going to get the DVD, get this restored version because the old special edition box set has a horrible, dull gray picture quality."	4.0	Overrated	2006-07-06	11	4	7

It's a fascinating look into how oppressive life would have been in the early 1800s in England (as a woman). Austen's work is marvelously adapted on the screen by some  amazing acting. Colin Firth is superb, but you already knew that, right? Jennifer Ehle is rarely praised in these blurbs and I feel the need to acknowledge her skill as an actress. She is spunky and vivacious just as Miss Bennett  should be.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3THA921HW1NMF	Lauren T.	Straight to the point:1. This adaptation is, by far, the best I've seen for ANY book out there. As a movie, it is extremely engrossing and entertaining. And while I can see a few die-hard Pride and Prejudice fans finding something to nit-pick about(we always do), MOST everyone else will probably end up falling in love with this story... and staying up til all hours of the morning cause Elizabeth and Darcy are much more important than sleep... :)2. As far as the technical quality, I feel the widescreen format is a wonderful addition, and the editing/transition from 6 episodes to 2 parts comfortably fluid. I enjoy the sturdy medium of DVD, and the ability to jump to my favorite scene. (I also own this on video.) The sound is fine, as is most of the color/video. The only gripe is about certain outdoor scenes on the first disk and one or two on the second that are whitewashed, over-exposed, whatever you want to call it. It does not, in my opinion, greatly detract from the over-all presentation, as the rest of the disk is perfectably watchable. I found that I was so quickly engrossed in the story that I could rather ignore that small fault.So, I say, I am very happy I bought this movie, it is well worth the price. Plenty of excitement, drama, witty dialogue, beautiful scenery, great story, and all this under the disguise of wholesome family literature stuff by that old English chick who wrote those romance stories.NOTE: I am not giving this DVD Special Edition version 5 stars ONLY because I have to reserve that last star for total and complete artistic and technical perfection.	4.0	Well worth the purchase price	2001-10-09	19	19	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A22MTZT8TFJVGA	Laurie Crist	I adore the adaptation, the actors, everything. I would love to give this the 5 stars it deserves, I own the miniseries on both the 6 VHS set and this special edition DVD. For convenience sake, the DVD is well, easier; no more waiting to rewind and plugging in a new tape every hour. However, if this is your reason for upgrading, I say burn it from your tapes.This DVD is such low quality, you realize from the first scene the degredation, you can barely see Netherfield when Bingly and Darcy first consider the property. The cuts between episodes are choppy and startling at times, the music does not always align correctly. I ignored a similar review when buying mine, thinking that I am not such a stickler, or film buff that I will notice so much, and I admit here I was wrong. I now cherish the Netherfield ball because for some reason the color and sound of that scene is far superior to the rest of the film.Even with the low quality sacrificed, still they could not fit it all on one disc with extra features on the second? This DVD is deplorable; and I truly wish the reformatting was entrusted to one of the many fan'atic's, of this otherwise near perfect film, who would have done it credit. I can only hope a remastered version will be released.	2.0	WARNING: A review of the format not the story	2002-06-10	21	18	3

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AS0X0UPGDGN3M	Leighcia	I've heard much about this movie before seeing it. My friend always mentioned her six tapes of pride and prejudice that she never got around to seeing. However, another friend and I dedicated a whole afternoon and part of an evening to watch this 5 hours movie and I daresay it wasn't a moment wasted.I really enjoyed the movie. The dialogue is witty and amusing. I've only tried to read one of Jane Austen's novels and I absolutely hated it because it seemed so long winded. The movie didn't seem to drag at all. Some of the lines were very memorable and I would like to use them in my own dialogue except I can't seem to remember them. After seeing a movie like this, I wish everyone talked in Victorian english. It has such a elegance to it. And in this movie, it really didn't sound fake and artifical but perfectly natural. What happened to that language?The acting was definitely amusing. The leads, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, possessed great depth in their acting even though at times Colin Firth's role as the taciturn Mr. Darcy seemed to require very little acting at all. Jennifer Ehle as Eliza Bennet was lively and lovable. Susanna Harker as Jane Bennet was also just as lovable and I really enjoyed her exchanged with Eliza. The subtlety in the acting made the movie worthwhile, the little glances that they throw to each other and small smirks and grimaces. All the other characters provided wonderful comic relief. Alison Steadman as Mrs. Bennet was terrific! Her face looks like a cartoon and her voice just calls for laughter.But overall, the movie had that effect of dragging you in emotionally. You know that the main characters will end up marrying each other at the end (it's Jane Austen) but you nevertheless worry the whole way through about how it will happen. And at the end, after all the hoping and wishing, you finish the movie feeling nicely satisfied :)The five hour time span didn't seem to drag at all. In fact, it seemed to pass quite shortly and I really enjoyed every moment of it.	5.0	Brilliant :) I loved it :)	2001-07-29	2	2	0

Hook ""Lotusrising"""	"The bBC A&E; production is the longest and most lavish of the Pride and Prejudice films I have viewed. It fleshes out Darcey's character, which is helpful. The production is accurate in its recreation of dances, songs, etc., as well as being precise in its details in showing the contrast between the Bennetts and Bingley's higher society companions. The actress Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth) brings a sweet and fun quality yet she appears much too old to believe that Lizzie is ""not yet 1 and 20"". Though Ehle was 24 at the time of filming, she is a very mature 24 and would have suited playing a much older character, someone in her thirties. Colin Firth displays the right combination of emotions and you delightfully follow the subtle yet apparent changes to his behavior and character.The biggest criticism of the production is the overall too mature ages of the main characters as well as a lack of distinction of accents between the classes of characters.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2HKRNELD7DGX1	Lili_K	"This film is a brilliant and dynamic adaptation of Jane Austen's P&P.; Andrew Davies dreamt up a fantastic script, faithful to the plot and period, yet it is fresh and modern at the same time. I very much enjoyed the ""show it rather than tell"" scenes and all the extra scenes Davies came up with, like the introductory scene with Bingley & Darcy or the fencing scene telling a lot of things about their status, characters and feelings. The dramatisation of all the letters was also very enjoyable: showing events rather than the actors' having to read them endlessly without any actions. I also liked the way the Bennet girls were presented, how even the most everyday activities highlighted their characters.I also liked the way Darcy - played superbly by Colin Firth by the way! - was given more attention than just appearing occasionally at the scene. This way we were more familiar with his character, actions and his feelings for Elizabeth. As a result the surprise element is not so significant of course, but it did not lessen the merits of the production.Costumes, music, buildings and scenery were absolutely fantastic. They were not simply objects and background, they also disclosed a lot of useful information about the characters (e.g.: Darcy is wealthy, but has taste, lady Catherine is wealthy and pompous, Elizabeth is not very rich, but is natural and unpretentious...).The actors were also very good, although I have to admit that I thought Jennifer Ehle miscast as Elizabeth Bennet: she seemed too experienced, too knowing for a twenty-odd something-year-old girl. At times she was simply impertinent instead of daring and she just SMIRKED instead of smiling playfully. Thus Darcy appeared a far more positive character to me right from the start despite his aloof behaviour. Elizabeth Garvie in the '79 version was absolutely fantastic.And there was another miscast character: Wickham. He was just too slimy. I mean, he IS slimy all right, but in the beginning Elizabeth and the audience shouldn't know that. He should appear as a much more attractive person compared to Darcy. Adrian Lukis couldn't do that, he was a bit repulsive right from the start. So I was left with the feeling ""how could Lizzy fall for this guy's charm even for a second?!"" You aren't supposed to feel that from the start, you shouldn't be thinking, even as a spectator, that Elizabeth must be really foolish to like this guy instead of the charismatic and sexy Darcy!All in all, if you love the book, you are going to like this adaptation very much."	4.0	A brilliant and dynamic adaptation	2005-11-08	10	7	3
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3IMFZHFYXGXPQ	Lillith	Review of the TV production of 'Pride and Prejudice' starring Colin Firth and Jennifer EhleI have long been a devotee of Jane Austen's novel and I am always interested in dramatizations of it. This TV production is certainly the best I have seen; and contrasts very favourably, in my opinion, with the film that was recently released.  It is always a challenge to turn a novel into a film, especially when the novelist is as great a wordsmith and stylist as Jane Austen.  How can a dramatization, which must entail the abridgement of the words to a serious extent, succeed in presenting a meaningful interpretation?  And how, in a production aimed at a wide audience, is the apparent gulf between the contemporary viewer and the language of a late 18th/early 19th century novel to be bridged?The most obvious point of contrast between this production and the recent movie lies in its preservation of much of the original dialogue, and hence, not only of the nature and depth of the personalities of the novel, but also of its central theme: the painful and humiliating process of enlightenment which Darcy and Elizabeth must both undergo in order to merit their happiness.  The easy path, followed by the movie, of modernizing (and frequently replacing altogether) Austen's language, is fortunately avoided here.Firth and Ehle bring to their parts a crucial ability to communicate intelligence and depth of feeling, and give us the clear impression that they have thought seriously about the nature of the characters they are playing.  The challenge presented here to Firth as the actor of Darcy lies in the fact that in the novel we are never given Darcy's view of events except in an oblique way.  Firth has clearly endeavoured to create Darcy's own inner narrative - and I find his attempt interesting and convincing.  Whole scenes are added to provide additional insight into the 'missing pieces' of Darcy's personality and experience, and the viewer must make up her mind whether these are successful (the famous 'diving scene' at Pemberley, and the fencing lesson are two major examples).In fact, it is easy to identify differences between Firth's own view of certain scenes and some explicit descriptions in the book.  An important example is the early interaction between the two at Netherfield, where Elizabeth indirectly accuses Darcy of pride.  In the novel, the exchange is conducted at a playful level, and Darcy's growing attraction to Elizabeth is not yet a matter of serious anxiety to him.  In this production, on the other hand, Firth's Darcy is visibly disturbed at his emotional response to her; and the exchange is fraught and intense.  Whether Firth's deviation from the overt intention of the author, here and elsewhere in the production, amounts to any kind of challenge to Austen's own judgment in building the story, or should rather be viewed as a side-effect of translating the story into a visual medium (perhaps that is why it was thought necessary to spell out the birth of Darcy's conflicted passion for Elizabeth in a more obvious way) is an interesting question to consider.  In any case, the quality of Firth's acting ensures that the scene is successful.On the whole, I think the director has done an admirable job of making the novel entertaining for a contemporary audience, and at the same time preserving the essence of Austen's novel.  A clear example of the superiority of this production to the recent movie, is the 'second proposal scene', where Elizabeth finally accepts Darcy.  The scene is plausible and dignified, and the actors understand, and manage to recreate for us, the mixture of restraint and profound emotion, of propriety and daring, that Austen creates on the page.  In the movie, by contrast, the interpretation of the scene is so loosely 'adapted' that nothing is left but a sweet and banal love scene between characters who merely happen to share the names of Austen's characters, and look nice in their period costume.  An adaptation of 'Pride and Prejudice' should surely strive to present the novel's inner substance, and not just its outer shell.  By this measure, it is the TV production that succeeds.	5.0	This TV 'Pride and Prejudice' is far better than the movie...	2006-03-23	30	30	0

How nice to see a truly bonny Lizzy rather than Keira Knightly's ""heroin chic"" anorexic body, sunken eyes and prison matron wardrobe. Her flat chest is laughable. Jennifer Ehle is quite perfect, especially the quality of her laugh. The only downside is that in the scene of Lizzy and Darcy walking after his proposal, they are not arm-in-arm. An unabashed Darcy smile as he tucks Elizabeth's hand in his elbow would have had me swooning. In the special features, even the screen writer admits the final proposal could have been more intimately staged.

And so Mrs. Bennet's plan to marry off one of her five daughters to a rich man looks like it is well underway. This A&E; adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is quite simply the best of its kind ever made. Casting, costuming, sets, screenplay--everything combines excellently to flesh out the novel over a leisurely six hours.The supreme achievement of the work is that so many people watch it repeatedly in its entirety at one sitting--they just can't pull themselves away from the screen. Is this because of sex, nudity, murder, violence, or mystery? No, not at all. There isn't a hint of such things in the whole story. What holds our interest is the care put into the production. Our story is a quiet one, really, compared with much that is written today. As was typical in regency England, Mr. Bennet's estate is entailed; that is, on his death it cannot be inherited by his widow or daughters. It must go to the nearest male heir. And, since he and his wife never produced a son, that means it must go out of the family to a distant cousin, and the women would all be put out on the street if he so desired. Understandably, Mrs. Bennet is dismayed by this prospect, and turns her ambition towards marrying off as many of her daughters as possible to wealthy men, with the unspoken understanding that that will someday provide her with a refuge when her husband dies. The trouble is, wealthy men usually want wealthy wives, and the Bennet girls have no dowries. However, Jane has looks and Elizabeth--the heroine--has intelligence and wit, and on that slender hope rests everything else.Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth gives a highly effective performance, playing a character with many moods and who goes through more than one epiphany as our story progresses. She forms an early prejudice against the proud, wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, played by Colin Firth. He, too, must learn to change his ideas about things if he is to be happy and get his heart's desire. Firth's performance is more understated than Ehle's, but just as good. Together, their unlikely chemistry fuels the miniseries. All the other supporting characters are excellent as well, with the sole exception of the actress playing Mrs. Bennet; the character is supposed to be a nonsensical person, but this goes beyond that into cariacature, coming too far out of the fabric of the piece. Notwithstanding that, however, the rest of the ensemble pull it off handily.If you've never read Jane Austen's satiric masterpiece, you will surely want to after having seen this movie. And if you have read it, you won't rest until going through it again to relive your favorite scenes now brought to life so beautifully. I give it my highest possible recommendation."	5.0	"""I never saw so many delightful girls in my life!"""	2002-07-19	5	5	0

The BBC/A&amp;E production of PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE brings to life the classic love story of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in such a breathtaking manner that viewers will be spellbound, and wish for it to never end.The acting, to say the least, is superb.  All of the characters are well performed, and seem to be exactly as they should.  Too often a movie adaptation of a beloved book will break up the original images of characters formed in one's mind by the author's writing.  This, luckily, is not the case in BBC/A&amp;E's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, in which each actor seems to have been put on earth specially for the purpose of playing their part in this wonderful movie.  Special note should go to the characters of Mr. Collins, who is as odious as one could possibly imagine, and of Mrs. Bennet, who will make viewers cringe every time she speaks.The costumes are wonderful, to the extent that I wish I had the guts to wear the same style of clothing to my high school.  Oh well.  Daydreams will have to suffice.Set it all on the backdrop of lush, beautiful England, add some great instrumental music, and the end result is not to be missed.  Definitely worth the five hours of one's time that it takes to see the entire movie.

"Many people name the 1996 A&E; version of Pride & Prejudice as their favorite ever. I own all the versions of this story and it certainly is mine. This was a full miniseries - not just a movie - so they were able to fit in ALL sorts of sub-stories and characters that movies often had to trim away. Colin Firth was brilliant at Mr. Darcy. A&E; worked with the BBC, so the costumes, locations and backgrounds were all extremely authentic.Most of the lines are straight out of the book, again a luxury you can have when the mini-series gives you so much time to work with. They could include many different scenes, and many different situations, that a 2 hour movie would have to cut for time reasons.I adore many parts of this miniseries. It's great to contrast Mr. Collins' list of reasons why he WILL mary Lizzie against Darcy's list of why he didn't WANT to marry her. Where the dad is shown as a quiet angel in many other versions, in this one he is shown to have his dark side too, in how he snipes at family members even when they're sad. The timing of Darcy coming to Lizzie to ask for her hand is *perfect* - she has just heard of his behavior with Jane, and she deliberately stayed home from dinner with him. You can really feel that she has been stewing all evening and he presents a perfect opportunity for her to lash out. The scene regarding Mr. Wickham at Pemberly is just great ... and the Collins visit after Lydia runs off is brilliant.In this version, Lizzie never reveals to her family how Darcy helped with Lydia's situation; she simply asks them to accept him on her say-so. Also, there's no ""reconcilement"" early on between Lizzie and Darcy. During the various parties early on, they don't agree to be friendly at any time. It's just constant antagonism along with the attraction pull. I have to admit that I like the 1939 version of the early parties, where there is much more of a powerful attraction going on. Still, each version is going to be different.Highly recommended - set aside a rainy afternoon, get yourself some wine and cheese, and enjoy it straight through!"	5.0	My Favorite Version of the Book	2007-07-15	6	6	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AY3A0RLJ2KP0B	"Liz Young ""lizyounguk"""	I have only one very minor carp about this production: they should have included the scene where Lizzie tells her mother she is marrying Mr Darcy. It's one of the funniest pieces of dialogue in English literature - anyone who hasn't read the book will find it worth while for that alone. This was the best costume drama the BBC (OK, and A&amp;E) have ever done, and they do one every fall. I'm still waiting for them to exceed this, but doubt that they ever will. Us poor Brits have to pay a license fee for the BBC, as they don't allow advertising, but when they come up with something like this we tend to concede that it's worth it. My then 16 yr old daughter moaned when it was first on TV. I told her to shut up and watch it; within 10 minutes she was hooked and has watched about 97 times since. Yes, the chemistry between Mr D and Lizzie was wonderful but I loved the minor characters, too: after first reading P&amp;P many years ago the ones that stuck in my head were the loathsome Lady Catherine and Mr Collins. These are perfection in this production: absolutely nobody could have done them better. And for the information of one reviewer, Mrs Bennet is SUPPOSED to be annoying! (For heaven's sake!) Anyone who enjoyed this will probably also enjoy the Kate Beckinsale (as opposed to Gwyneth P) version of Emma. Prunella Scales (Fawlty Towers) does a truly wonderful Miss Bates, and Mr Woodhouse is also perfection. For my money Mark Strong also makes a far more wooze-making and 'knightly' version of Mr Knightley than the chap Gwyneth's Emma ended up with.As many reviewers have said, this P&amp;P is one to watch over and over: when you're sick, feeling down, or just feel like it...  Sublime chicken soup for the romantic soul.Oh, and I do with Andrew Davies and his crew would do some of the Georgette Heyer novels. Black Sheep, anybody?	5.0	Simply the best...	2002-12-18	4	3	1

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1UKSUAKL776RZ	L. Mesinger	I am a huge lover of Pride and Prejudice.  I lost track of how many times I've seen the VHS version (I taped it off of A&amp;E and then bought the tape set).  It is a superb production; the acting, production, screen play and scenery are fantastic.The problem with the VHS versions is that the one taped from A&amp;E has a lot of the scenes cut out, and the box set keeps you switching tapes and fastforwarding through the commercials every 50 minutes.  The DVD is much more convenient and even includes extra scenes (more like extra lines to a few scenes, something only a huge fan would notice).It is true that the DVD contains no subtitles, which is a big disappointment, because there is a line or two where I never could figure out what is being said.  I didn't notice the sound difficulties pointed out in other reviews, but the color is washed out.  I had to adjust the &quot;picture mode&quot; on my television and it's still faded somehow.  The DVD extras are nothing special, and I was disappointed not to find any interviews with the main characters (I wanted to see how they look &quot;normally.&quot;)In spite of these small problems with the DVD, I highly recommend it for all P&amp;P lovers.  The convenience of only having to get up once (and you probably don't watch the whole thing in one sitting anyway) plus the 5 minutes or so of extra footage make this DVD a must.  Factor in that it is actually cheaper than the VHS set, and there's no question.  Simply adjust the settings on your television before watching, and settle in to 2 hours and fifty minutes of continuous Jane Austen.	5.0	Convenience outweighs loss in color	2003-10-24	262	246	16

The settings, the costumes everything seemed complete down to the littlest detail. The series stayed fairly true to the book, and the ending was enhanced more so than the book which made the story seem even more wonderful.Anyone who has seen BJD, will note that the Mr. Darcy in BJD is the same gentlemen (Colin Firth) who plays Mr. Darcy in 'Pride &amp; Prejudice'.  This was, by no means, a coincidence as interviews with Fielding stated that Firth was choosen for the BJD role because  he was Mr. Darcy in PP.At any rate, anyone who has read/seen BJD or any related books will adore this movie.	5.0	Mr. Darcy Mr Darcy!	2002-04-19	2	2	0

As a student and teacher of Literature, Theatre, and Film I can confidently and categorically state that this is the finest film adaptation of any classic novel ever produced.  The screenplay is remarkably faithful, the art direction spellbinding, the costuming and settings are breathtaking, while the casting showcases the strongest ensemble of actors I have ever witnessed.  Bear in mind that this is all coming from someone who has never seen an adequate film version of any classic novel, to the extent that I no longer thought it possible.  Ladies, beware Colin Firth as the definitive Darcy for he is guaranteed to make you swoon.  Jennifer Ehle, as Lizzy, stole my heart.  Please don't tell my wife but I have never been so deeply in love with any actress.  Her elegant and powerfully understated portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet does Austen's scintillating satire of manners great credit. In the context of recently produced Austen films I would say that Roger Michell's production of Persuasion was endearing, Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility was a treat for both, but Simon Langton's production of Pride and Prejudice is the most sublime, definitive, and unparalleled production of P&P yet produced. It is just pure Austen. Both First and Last Impressions remain the same on this one, it is a true classic. An absolute MUST for all Jane Austen fans. Yes, Virginia I have two copies. The 1996 edition and the 2001 Digitally Remastered ""Special Edition."" Although the audio is somewhat better on the remaster I would argue that the color and resolution are richer on the original.

Colin Firth IS exactly how I pictured Mr.Darcy ,right down to the arrogant, smug look on his face, a face I wanted to slap several times while watching, which of course is a shame because ...well Colin Firth is easy on the eyes. The casting of Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth was a good choice, you could just feel the chemistry between the two, as it practically leapt off the screen. Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's mother.. well oh my goodness she was just so annoying, and the actress who portrayed her was amazing.  I liked the fact that this was a 2 disc set, and I liked that it was in an Episode format. Sometimes I just don't feel like sitting down for a whole movie, and being that this version is 5hrs and 23 minutes. I could watch an episode and then watch another episode later.I haven't seen another version of this, so I can't compare it to another, however I can say that after reading the book The characters of Mr Darcy,Elizabeth, and Elizabeth's mother portrayed in this version are EXACTLY how I  pictured them. The only thing is the actress who portrayed Jane, ELizabeth's older, beautiful sister is not how I pictured her, but she was still good.

I am not one for period movies and wasn't sure what to expect.  I must admit that I watched this in part, because it was regarded so highly in the book, ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", which was loosely based on Jane Austen's book.This beautiful story is brought to life on screen in such an amazing way.  The casting is absolutely wonderful as are the costumes and the scenary.  It seems that they truly were able to capture that period on time on film, flawlessly.Jennifer Ehle is amazing.  She's stunning, clever and charming and I can't think of anyone better to perform that role. It was so memorable. Collin Firth really defines Mr. Darcy.  His range of emotion is absolutely wonderful.  It's not even the words he speaks, it's the non-verbals that really make it.  Stellar performance.The remaining casting was fabulous as well.  Particulary Elizabeth's parents, her sister Jane and her youngest sister.I can't say enough about this film.  An absolute surprise for me as I wasn't sure if I would even like this film.  It's well worth the time spent viewing as including all of the story, really added to the depth and made it even more enjoyable than a typical 2 hour movie.I will be watching this movie again and again in the future.  It's one of my top favorites of all time.As for the quality of the DVD.  It's fine and what I would expect for a $23.99 2DVD set.  No complaints.

However, I dislike having to get up and switch discs in the middle of the movie.  Obviously, this is NOT a reason to avoid purchasing this.  But, it is the reason that I deducted a star.  Just in case someone is perfectly satisfied with their older set of P&P DVDs and only wanted these in the hope that it's one disc.  However, it being on two discs is not such a big deal; it's a long movie after all, odds are that you'll have to get up anyway!  It's just that ""sometimes"" it has a knack for needing a disc change right at the moment you were really into the movie and didn't want leave it for the realities of the DVD player."	4.0	Image quality improved; still 2 Discs!	2010-05-03	6	3	3

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AM0YSQ672WUDX	"Luiza ""Luiza"""	"Girl meets both good guy and bad guy.Bad guy turns worse.Showdown.Good guy gets girl.This, in short, is the story but of course I'm joking - Jane Austen's laconic wit and the delightful lightness of her writing are justly famed and have lost nothing of their charm and entertaining quality in two hundred years. As with all of her books, they are very well worth reading because of her wonderful ironic comments that usually fall by the wayside in dramatisations, even the best ones. I feel that this TV production, too, would have benefitted from an occasional background narrator giving us at least the funniest of Austen's remarks and observations about her characters. But all in all, that is a minor point: This ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a gem, every single actor is fantastic, Jennifer Ehle does justice to Elizabeth's vivacity and wit, on top of being truly beautiful and having a lovely and mischievous smile (funny that the very same actress all but ruined ""Possession"" for me but that is a different story). Colin Firth is simply perfect as the brooding dark horse who turns out to be such a diamond in the rough (if you permit the cheap metaphor). He is, in short, the thinking woman's heartthrob and that alone should be reason enough to watch this DVD. Afterwards, you'll want to read the book, too.

Every time I watch PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, first wearing out my video cassette that I copied from A & E back in 1996 and now with this DVD, I am so swept away by the story, the acting, the costumes, scenery; everything!  This movie is PERFECTION!  It is so true to the book that whenever I watch this film, I will watch my favorite parts, over and over and over!  I do the same thing when I read the book!  And having a DVD makes it so much easier.  I can watch the chance meeting between Darcy and Elizabeth at Pemberley and, their glance across the room also at Pemberley 10 times in a row!  Whenever I watch this movie I am depressed when it is over (like the book).My only criticism of the DVD is the color on the first disc.  Everything is so faded--it's almost like watching it in black and white.  How did it pass quality control?  The second disc is much better.P.S.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1N6712C6JHYJ9	"MagnoliaSouth ""As soon go kindle fire with sn..."	"This is the most brilliant adaptation of the famed Jane Austen book ever made. It is long, but true to the book. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone  was criticized widely for staying true to the book, but P&amp;P has escaped such criticism. Perhaps because of the creative nature of the actors and obviously, the director.Colin Firth became an overnight heartthrob through his very absorbing, as well as attractive, portrayal of Mr. Darcy. Jennifer Ehle's performance was quite memorable as well as much of the cast. The film doesn't highlight any one character, outside of the leading Mr. Darcy and Miss Eliza Bennet, over any other. What makes a great film is when you try to imagine a film without other characters. If you find yourself saying something along the lines of ""it just wouldn't be the same without ____ (naming nearly every character),"" then you must admit that everyone in the film has succeeded.Each actor portrayed each character perfectly. Mrs. Bennet was very loud and obnoxious. Lydia was childish and embarrassing. Miss Caroline Bingley was elegant but spiteful. Miss Georgiana Darcy was kind and gentle. Mr. Collins was sickening. Lady Catherine was not only frightening, but certainly condescending. It doesn't matter which actor or character you look at, they were all very believable.Cinematography could have been better. It does well enough but many shots could be better imagined with a great cinematographer. However, this was a miniseries and not an actual feature film so the flaw is certainly excusable. Costumes and sets were beautiful. The grandness of Pemberley was exciting to see.The most interesting aspect of the film was its influence on its viewers. P&amp;P led to a sudden Jane Austen revival. Suddenly, more Jane Austen books were being sold, more Jane Austen movies were being made. It was referred to as `the Jane Austen bug' and the credit for the biting went to this film. P&amp;P was enjoyed by all genders, ages and cultures. Fan fiction, from modern to regency, began to pop up on the net everywhere (usually fiction relating to Mr. Darcy's feelings, which is interesting). Some fan fiction even made it to a publisher, became a bestseller, then was made into a film with the very same Colin Firth playing Mr. Darcy in the fan fiction known as Bridget Jones's Diary!So to say the least this film is indeed a classic. It has had a great influence in the lives of its viewers. It is well worth your precious time to sit and watch it in its entirety. You won't find that it was a waste. In fact, I'm sure you'll find yourself watching it over and over again.I give it a whopping 5 out of 5. If I could, I'd give it a 10 out of 5.

Terribly and pleasantly surprised to see Lucy Davis. Overall a wonderful rendition. I can absolutely see why it is considered the first truly successful screen adaptation of P&P. However, there are small issues that keep me from giving a perfect 5-star rating. For example, Jane Bennet is supposed to be clearly and obviously the most traditionally beautiful of the Bennet girls. However, Jennifer Ehle is equally if not more beautiful, confusing that issue. Furthermore, I was not happy with the sermonizing voiceover at the end of the series. It renders the successes of Elizabeth/Darcy and Jane/Bingley as one-dimensional examples of a moral on what proper marriage is. It would have been far better to let their happiness stand on their own instead of proselytizing on the evils that marriage is meant to prevent.	4.0	Great overall, but some little things that can annoy	2013-11-08	1	0	1

For one thing it has subtitles, and there were bits of dialog that I could not make out before, and camera shots that seemed rather out of focus, etc. I really appreciated the improved sound and color of this one, but I find the credits at the end of the episodes to be distracting, and the art at the beginning of the discs not so attractive. Also the break between discs not as natural. I loved the 10 year lookback a wonderful addition, though I do wish it had included Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. The walkabout was worthless. It felt like it was put in to fill up disc space. It has it's strengths and weaknesses, as does the other edition. I need them both!	5.0	P&P Restored	2014-06-04	1	1	0

If allowed, I could go on and on about it.  However, when screen versions of famous novels are released, it is almost always the case that certain elements are left out, new ones are added, or the plot is completely changed.  Thus, screen versions rarely turn out to be as good as the original novel.  Yet, this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a definite exception.  The casting, the setting, the plot, and the portrayal of the characters all followed the book religiously, and more than surpassed my every expectation.  This is, undoubtedly, one of the very best screen adaptations of a novel ever done.  Even if you have never read a Jane Austin novel, or seen a movie based on one of her novels, I still recommend this mini-series as a wonderful romantic comedy, complete with plot twists and turns you may very well never see coming.

The site has combined the reviews for all the versions, the good, the bad, and the ugly. If you can find the VHS you will see the mini-series in all its glory; this restored version is the restoration of that original. This is the DVD to buy!The special edition is a terrible remake; as others say here, the colors are so washed out, it's hard to tell a yellow from a white, green from  yellow, and so on. Color in the original is sharp and clear, viz.Eliza Bennett's complexion after a walk.  I almost sent my copy back but never got around to it.Even the two-disc jacket is a washout. Do not waste your money on the ""special"" edition. Somewhere in these thousand reviews, I reviewed that edition and urged people to look for the VHS, it was so bad. I guess BBC finally figured out why. I know there will be comments about the technical improvements, about how they ""restored"" the series, so I'll move on.The story will always be a delight for both men and women as it centers on the human condition of both in pursuit of the elusive Mr. or Ms. Right. It is especially funny when Austen puts Mr. and Mrs. Bennett under the microscope: married couples will have a ball with this relationship! The theme is Austen's favorite; IMO this is her best rendering of that theme: the manners and mores of 19th c. England, esp. its class divisions and laws of primogeniture. That the two main characters overcome obstacles both outside and inside themselves is a triumph. The film is true to the book, almost line by line, which is lovely as it captures Austen's satirical wit and tender sensitivity. The actors are impeccable, all of them, and I guarantee you will never find a better performance of Mrs. Bennett's character as you will in this film!I won't retell the story as generations are reading and watching the novel for the first time.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A7JVGP3JSAXRS	Maria Rivera	I have a collection of this 1995 version of Pride and Prejudice but seeing it in blu-ray adds to the pleasure.  Everything is so clear and colorful.  Mr. Darcy is as handsome as ever; and Elizabeth Bennet is simply delightful. I can say the same for the rest of the characters.  This DVD has the beginning and ending credits after each episode but this is overlooked as the music is wonderful and I don't mind hearing it as much as it's played.  All the people involved in making this series should be given an A+++++++++.  This Keepsake Edition has added features of interest which you will enjoy after viewing the series.  I can't tell you how many times I've watched this---whether it's on the original VHS, regular DVD or on blu-ray.  I even compiled my own movie soundtrack cd which I listen to on a regular basis.

As others have rightfully pointed out the image quality is so poor that it's difficult to watch.  Washed out colors, grainy resolution, blurriness, contrast problems, and uneven sound quality all contributed to a disappointing and, in all honesty, annoying experience.I watched ""Pride and Prejudice"" on television when it was originally aired.  I immediately bought the VHS set and enjoyed it immensely.  Then I purchased the Laserdisc version (so that I'd have a copy of P&P; that would hold up given how many times I like to watch it) and again saw no degradation of quality, in fact the Laserdisc format provided better picture quality than the VHS format.  Therefore, I'm comparing this DVD edition to those I've already seen and it definitely lacks!  As much as I would like to have the series in the widescreen format I'll be returning my copy for a refund, and I'm going to wait and see if a better edition is produced.

I usually find them sadly lacking compared to (good) movies. Well, not this time. This series surpasses everything you have ever seen on TV and probably ever will see! Regardless of the genre. Most movies (I'm talking good historical films) also pale in comparison. This is an incredible piece. Not only is it sublimely acted (at all levels since there isn't a single bad actor, but particularly Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle who are both extremely convincing), but the costumes, the music, the exteriors and set designs are absolutely perfect. The sharp eye will notice a few (but oh so minor) technical errors, but they take nothing from the enjoyment. Beware though, it is addictive! You may need your Darcy/Lizzy daily fix afterwards.

Jennifer Ehle is nearly as good as a cool, cerebral but emotionally available heroine.  The father, Mr.Bennet, is a delicious melding of humor and sarcasm.  I do have two quibbles.  Mrs. Bennet, the heroine's mother, is aptly done, but her shrillness becomes wearing early in the story.  I would have preferred less volume and more subtlety in this character. Secondly, Susannah Harker, whom I know from other productions to be capable of a powerful performance, is strangely vapid in her portrayal of the eldest Bennet daughter. Being pretty and smiling a lot is simply not enough, and is in sharp contrast to the well delineated characterizations delivered by most of the cast. However, on balance this production is excellent, and in an imperfect world really is about as good as it gets.	5.0	As Good As It Gets	2010-09-17	1	1	0

The measure of how good this production is can be shown by the fact that despite having seen it three times previously, my wife and I stayed up until two in the morning to watch the entire film. Much better on DVD, without those artificial commercial breaks, and low-quality image on television, the film is superbly acted all around.Jennifer Elhe walks walks away with the honors here; her Elizabeth Bennett is perfect.  Colin Firth's inarticulate Darcy is an excellent foil for her.  Simon Langton's direction is good, straightforward, letting the actors speak Austen's one paragraphers (as opposed to one-liners) with all the impetus required to deliver such well-constructed prose.Even the divergances from the novel are welcome; there is nothing overly arty or disruptive to upset the narrative.  Too bad nobody has the guts to reshoot this film with this cast with Hollywood production standards.  Compare the lighting to &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; which is filmed in equisite light.  Still, this is a better film, despite the absence of any name stars.	5.0	Best Austen Adaptation	2002-01-20	2	2	0

I must say that I didn't have very high expectations for it at all, because it seemed to be boring to me, as a ten year old. But I instantly fell in love with the movie. It became a classic in my mind. A movie that I could never live without (yes I realize I may be exaggerating a bit.) I've seen it so many times that I have every line memorized, and yet, every time I watch it, it seems new and, dare I repeat, wonderful. The acting is absolutely splendid, when you realize how much effort it would take to act in a film that took place in a time period so foreign from your own. They performed it wondefully. I love the story as well. It's what I would call the perfect romance movie, the kind you just cannot finish until the girl gets the guy (or the guy gets the girl.) Every time I start watching I can't stop watching it until it's over, and even then, I usually start it over again, just because I'm so sorry to see it end.  The scenery is absolutely lovely. Whenever I watch it, it makes me jealous because I want to be in England and, surprisingly, I want to live in that time period. I love the costumes, they are extremely beautiful.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O	"MartinP ""MartinP"""	This BBC/A&amp;E series is right up there with Brideshead Revisited as the best work ever done for TV; and due to its tauter story line, its light-footed wit and its stylistic unity I am more and more convinced that P&amp;P may just have the edge... Whereas Brideshead deals with drama that, despite its religious undertones, is basically modern, P&amp;P is driven by lots of excitement over events that may seem rather futile from a 21st century perspective. However, the art of the makers of this series, and indeed of Jane Austen, is such, that the viewer is drawn into the frame of reference of middle and upper class people in the early 1800s from the very first scenes, and within 30 minutes you're hooked. I think I have watched this series ten or eleven times by now, and its delights are undiminished, as, surprisingly, is the suspense - will they get each other or not?The series derives much of its strength directly from the strength of Austen's text: it closely adheres to both the words and the spirit of the book. This filmed version is worlds away from the absurd, stuffily Victorian 40s movie, with hoop-skirted ladies, an overdose of frills and heavily mutilated dialogue. Here, we get all the breezy freshness of the early years of the Romantic era, with its love of nature and naturalness, reflected both in frequent outdoor activities and Greek-style dress for the ladies, among other things. The series' makers have exploited this further in stressing the basic similarity of Elizabeth and Darcy as nature beings, both using physical activity as an antidote to emotional turmoil: she tramping through the countryside whenever she can; he, taking fencing lessons, and his by now famous dive into the Pemberley pond to overcome his feelings for the woman who refused him.The balance between high comedy and emotional drama is expertly judged. Mr Collins and Mrs Bennet provide many occasions for laughter, without ever quite sinking into mere caricature, and the elegant cynicism adopted by Mr Bennet to deal with his less than happy choice of partner, is titillating (though in the end it becomes his undoing). At the same time, the story hinges on a few scenes of extreme dramatic power, each and every one representing (more than) Oscar-worthy feats of acting and writing. Darcy's first proposal, with Colin Firth pacing the Hunsford Parsonage parlour like some animal in distress, is played out as an unparalleled clash of two very powerful and independent characters, both acting on misguided preconceptions, and the viewer is made to feel the violent emotions of both most acutely. The meeting in the Pemberley grounds, much later, then offers the catharsis. This is the beginning of Darcy's transformation, something Austen leaves implicit in her text, a problem which has been resolved by the script writers of the series in a way that aspires to sheer genius. The proud aristocrat turns into a stammering, lovesick schoolboy and yet it is clear we are only seeing another side to the same man. And finally there is the fantastic scene of Lady Catherine's Great Intervention: a duel of words as sharp as any ever written, delivered with utmost conviction, and, astonishingly, representing a literal four-page long citation from the book: such is the power of Austen the dramatist! Of course all these main protagonists are perfectly cast, but the same seems to hold true even for the smallest supporting roles. Lady Anne de Bourgh doesn't speak a single word during her few appearances - and yet how we pity her when we briefly cut from the final wedding ceremony to the Rosings saloon, where she is locked up, newly deprived of her intended husband, with that Gorgon of a mother... It is one of the instances, by the way, where the script writers have made a character a little more sympathetic than Austen did, who stresses Anne's haughtiness; here, she is a frail, morose and pitiable creature. To some extent the same even goes for Darcy - in the book, at his second proposal, he somewhat self-righteously stresses that Lizzy's bad opinion of him the first time, was based on her being deceived by others; in the series, he appears more softened and contrite.So this is perfection then? Unfortunately, no such thing exists... Even in a production so carefully managed as this one, on repeated viewing one notices the odd mistake: lush green foliage in front of Longbourn, two days before Christmas; distinctly 20th century stained glass behind the minister performing the Wickham wedding; Mr. Darcy, running up the stairs to his room at Rosings, and next seen looking out of its window - on the ground floor. But such little slips are massively compensated by everything that is spot on, from the food on the table to the lack of a pin under the cellist's instrument. And talking about cello's, Carl Davis's score is a masterpiece in itself, with some extremely memorable instances of musical characterization. His heavily ornamented baroque sounds constitute at least half of Lady Catherine's pompous, reactionary character.To my regret I have to agree with other reviewers who complain about the colors on the DVD. Scenes do appear over-exposed, with too extreme dark-light contrasts, and midtones are faded. Some fiddling with your TV color settings helps a little, but will not restore the nuances of color that we know from the broadcasts to be there.  DVD on the other hand does offer an enduring memento of what is definitely one of the greatest moments in TV-history!	5.0	An indispensable piece of TV-history!	2004-03-09	26	26	0

Although the casting is wonderful throughout, I cannot imagine this production without Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. They just click together.My daughter is a huge fan of the Keira Knightley version of Pride and Prejudice. She thought this one just wasn't up there with that version. This one, she said, lacks passion!! Oh, my dearest daughter! Passion is in no way lacking in this production. But instead of heaving chests and heavy breathing, it's in the chemistry between Darcy and Elizabeth (Firth and Ehle for those who may not know). It's in the nuances, the body language, especially from Darcy. And those eyes!! That man speaks volumes with his eyes. Colin Firth IS Mr. Darcy, and I can never picture anyone else in that role. And the swimming scene with Darcy walking up on Elizabeth and his stammering and nervous awkwardness at the situation...and her embarrassment...great, great stuff!!I enjoyed very much the extra material included in this DVD set. Especially hearing Andrew Davies talk about why he chose to write certain scenes as he did. I can never again watch the scene where Elizabeth walks to Netherfield and meets Darcy just outside without remembering the comments of Mr. Davies!!I am so proud to have this in my video collection.

Each scene was a polished jewel of dialogue, scenery, and melody.  How pleasant to enter a world that values character, refinement,and family cohesion.  The length of the production allows the development of depth of character which is missing in so many movies.  The actors, scenery, and costumes are so well chosen that I became swept away into another time and place. I relaxed in the professionalism of the production, suspended disbelief, and gave myself over to pure enjoyment.  It has replaced ""Gone With The Wind"" as my favorite viewing experience."	5.0	CAPTIVATING ENTERTAINMENT	2005-10-14	6	2	4

We LOVE some of A&amp;E's other Great productions,  but once we finally had the chance to see A&amp;E's Pride and Prejudice, we  Couldn't Help Ourselves!  We have watched it SO many times, and just  LOVE it MORE and MORE each time.  We have taped it, bought the six video  boxed set,  the DVD, and the musical movie soundtrack CD.  We saw two other  movie versions of Pride and Prejudice that are Good, but A&amp;E's  production OUTSHINES them both.  EVERYTHING in this movie is SUPERB: the  cast and the GREAT Chemistry between them, the Beautiful music, dances,  scenery,  costumes, dialogue, and the attention to details. This movie  truly brings the Genius of Jane Austen to LIFE!  It gives us CHILLS every  time we watch it!  We have seen ALL the other movie adaptations of Jane  Austen's Great masterpieces including the newest one, Mansfield Park, which  we saw two weeks ago.  They were All EXCELLENT, but Pride and Prejudice is  still the ABSOLUTE BEST!	5.0	BEST MOVIE AND LITERARY ADAPTATION WE HAVE EVER SEEN!	2000-01-17	17	14	3

I'll not re-hash what has been said in nearly 2000 positive reviews on Amazon other than to say this is easily the best adaptation of Pride and Prejudice available today. Now, with the restored version available on DVD and the Blu-ray versions available the picture quality is much improved over the original broadcast in 1995. The sound quality is also good, many of the scenes have music playing in the background which is clear, while not interfering with the dialogue.It's really an excellent deal, if you haven't seen it before then you really need to. If you haven't seen it since 1995 as was the case for me, you won't believe how much work has gone into updating the picture quality.	5.0	Unbelievable Restoration on Blu-Ray	2011-12-17	1	1	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A15TMW8RWR54UF	"M. Clemmensen ""Mary"""	As a huge fan of Jane Austen's works, I have to confess I try to find something worthwhile in any/all productions I have watched of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; over the years.  The BBC miniseries starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle eclipses all film and live versions I have seen to date.  First and foremost it is painstakingly faithful to the book in its script and characterizations and the performances are absolutely charming. Simon Langton's direction succeeds in conveying volumes to the audience, often when no words are spoken; the same sublety that captivated audiences in his brilliant work in &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; is prevalent in P &amp; P and allows the viewer an added dimension in understanding the story and its characters.  The scenery is magnificent and the set designs and costumes are painstakingly recreated with attention to the book's details and realism for the period.I recommend it highly to all (a must-see for Austen fans) especially for those not familiar with her works, it would be a wonderful introduction.	5.0	Jane Austen Would Approve	2003-09-12	4	4	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2DX17ZG8M8N7H	M.Cooling	I completely and entirely fell in love with this production of an Era long gone by; Colin Firth ( Mr Darcy) was very appropriately cast as the handsome well bred gentleman Master of Pemberly and Jennifer Ehle (Miss Elizabeth Bennet) as the vivacious, somewhat of a rebel for her day, but with utmost wit to complement her warm personality. They both gave an outstanding performance to be well remembered. In contrast Adrian Lukis'(Lt Wickham)performance was wanting, he did not quite meet the demands of his character. My favorite supporting character study was that of colourful Mrs Bennet by the very talented actress Alison Steadman very well coupled with a well tempered Benjamin Whithtrow as Mr Bennet and they were all highly complimented by a fine cast of actors under the Direction of Simon Langton of 'Upstairs Downstairs' fame.For a production to be complete all of the very important and necessary ingredients must come together like a delightful symphony and Pride and Prejudice exemplifies this. Aside from a carefully chosen cast there was great care in the choice of costumes, beautiful cinematography of the English countryside with its gentry coupled with a truly joyful music to accompany the many lighthearted moments.I watched the very colourful characters come alive and so the magic was there.It is of interest to note that very few productions are done with such care as this one and resist the temptation of making major changes in an already Great Creation.Many people who are not at present into reading the classics will be encouraged to read Jane Austen's ingeniously written masterpiece.It would have given Jane Austen great Pride to see her work  elevated to a new dimension, but followed so carefully as not to Prejudice her Masterful Creation.M.Cooling	5.0	Pride and Prejudice with Colin firth is a must see !	2000-12-22	2	2	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2AW94LPL8IL8N	MDmom	I ordered this blu-ray version of Pride and Prejudice to see what updates had occurred to the film.Pros:+ Much better color (the color on the DVD version is washed out and yellow looking)+ More visible details, especially in the textiles (clothes, linens, drapes, etc.) and paintings+ Much better sound quality+ New special features that are really great.  If you're a real P&P; fan, this version is worth owning just for the special features.  Seriously.Cons:- The detail is not as good as I would have hoped for blu-ray, it's sort of grainy and only slightly better than the DVD version. Which is odd considering how much more detail you can see in the textiles, but I think that might be due to the color being so vastly improved. Anyway, I know it's an older movie, but Singin' in the Rain is MUCH older and the blu-ray version of that movie is spectacular.- The DVD version had joined segments 1-3 on the first disc and segments 4-6 on the second disc, without any credits rolling in between the segments.  This blu-ray version has segments 1-4 on the first disc with credits rolling between each segment, which is sort of annoying after you're used to 2.5 hours of the film with no credits. The second disc has segments 5 and 6, as well as all the special features, which as I mentioned before, are great.Conclusion: definitely worth buying if you're a P&P; fan, but I won't be selling my DVD version on eBay.	4.0	Definitely worth buying for the true P&P fan	2014-04-24	1	1	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2O9GJK59XQWBB	Mealy Potatoes	My wife has been trying to get me to watch this movie ever since we were dating.  She has read the book about 20 times, and seen the movie about 30 times.  She finally got me to watch it about a week ago.  It was a good movie.  It is not the type of movie that I would go out and rent myself, or that I would have watched with my roomates back when I was single (we would have given noogies and called eachother sissies at even the mention of watching a movie like this), but I enjoyed it.  On the other hand, at home with my wife, it was a pretty good movie to see.  THe acting was really good, and the story just sort of kept getting better and better.  Also there were some really memorable lines in it.In any case for the guy that likes action movies, well, this movie is probably not for you.  But if your wife or lady-fair wants to watch it, well it is a pretty good movie to watch together.(I am sure that there are some people who are going to hate me for my comments, but that's what I think).	4.0	Pretty good movie	2000-12-05	7	7	0

She wore a contemptuous, pinched, uptight little smile throughout the entire miniseries (okay, I admit that I didn't watch the whole thing because I had to turn it off due; however, I can't imagine that that ""look"" went away--it seemed firmly entrenched.) It reminded me of that squinty-eyed, tight smile that Renee Zellweger sometimes sports, but much more annoying! It made the series unwatchable for me, even though I adore Jane Austen. I think that a lead actress should have more range, especially in a lengthy miniseries, and that she should seem ""Elizabethan"" (not Church Ladyesque)."	2.0	Jennifer Ehle has same pinched smile on her face for hours!	2009-01-30	15	3	12
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A21OJ208JYJO7A	Melily	Myself, my mom, my sister and my dad have watched this movie together several times now, and we still love it just as much as the first time we watched it, if not more. One aspect that I love especially is that the writer(s) did not get pulled into the false belief that they needed to change Jane Austen's words in order to make it good (as seen in the 2005 version). This version is amazingly like the book, which is a big part of what makes it so enjoyable.Another is the acting. Colin Firth is the best Mr. Darcy I have ever seen, and Jennifer Ehle plays Elizabeth extremely well. They both capture Austen's characters exactly. I have to admit that I don't know the names of most of the other actors... But I can't think of one that is not perfectly suited to their part. Also (as my mom always constantly comments on throughout the movie...), the music is wonderfully composed, and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful.I can't say enough how great this film is! I highly recommend it. We watched this version a few days after seeing the newer one, and unanimously agreed that this version is waaaaaaaay better. It captures Austen's book so well... It's amusing, and, of course, wonderfully romantic (don't let that scare you off if you're not a chick flick kind of person - my dad usually isn't but he really enjoyed this film). It's one of my very favorite movies! I could watch it over and over and never get bored. In response to an earlier review, I didn't notice any problems with the color and saturation. And true, this is not the most special of special editions, but you definitely don't need special features to make this version the best Pride And Prejudice I have ever seen! PLEASE WATCH IT. You will not be sorry.	5.0	WE ALL LOVE IT!!!	2007-02-13	9	9	0

I think the story, if you've read it is entertaining and fairly true to the book except for some minor differences. An excellent transition considering most books to movies tend to chop great portions. Colin Firth definitely steals the show with his presence.

It's not only the best mini-series I've seen, but it also beats out most of my favorite movies.  The casting is wonderful, every character seems real and the actors play their parts very well.  From the smallest role to the biggest parts, all the characters are well-played.  Watching this, it seems Colin Firth IS Mr. Darcy.  Also, there is the famous wet shirt scene, and I must say, it does not disappoint.The DVD itself is nothing special, though it is convenient.  The coloring is poor and for a Special Edition there are very few special features.  Still, everything on two discs makes it all worth it.  It takes up only the space a normal DVD would, unstead of a huge 6 tape set.  That is a huge bonus.  I just wish there was more to the DVD.  I would appreciate at least subtitles in French, but I guess what I have will do.  The featurette is nice, but there are no interviews with any of the actors.  I would like to see their opinion of the mini-series, the story and the book.  It's always nice to see how the actors feel about their work.  But I guess what's there is enough.  The film speaks for itself.The only regret I have is that I saw this before I read the book.  I like imagining the scenery and characters for myself.  Although the movie provides more beautiful scenery, costumes and characters than I could imagine in my head, it still takes some of the fun out of it.	5.0	Amazing!	2004-07-05	5	5	0

Will they both prove too stubborn to admit they are in love? It is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the greatest miniseries of all times and certainly one of the best Jane Austen adaptations of all time. (Only Persuasion and perhaps one or two others come close.) And this is a marked improvement over the standard DVD, which wasn't sterling.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3289NYHSERXIX	Michael ZAbrek	I highly recommend Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. It is a great movie. IT has many parts to it which are very long which I recommend watching over a long period of time because it is too much to take in all at once. I will talk about the action and plot, set design, scene designers, and the director.Pride and Prejudice takes place in England. Mr. Bennet is giving all his money away to Mr. Collins. His brother when he dies. In England they don't give the money to the daughters but men first. So his daughters have to find men to support the family. This makes a very comical situation.The actors were very good. They portrayed very good emotion and acted their rolls well. The scene designers were very good it looked like they really takes place in the places the scenes were. I would have liked the directing to be different it's very simple no real camera angles exist that are impressive.I recommend this film if you like a long drawn out drama. If you are all about the action and adventure please do not see it. You have to be able to get involved in person's lives, which is something that I like. Also, it is hard to understand the people make sure to use those closed captions.As you can see I liked the film over all. I wouldn't pay to see it or see it again. But it was good enough to see for the first time for free in school. I hope the things I talked about help you in your decision in watching this film.	4.0	Pride and Prejudice	2001-08-30	4	1	3

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2AONQJS5TA4MZ	Michelle Dresser	Jane Austen's Pride &amp; Prejudice has been adapted for the big and small screen 3 times and the A&amp;E version is by far the best of the bunch.  What makes it so good?  For one it was filmed as a miniseries, so it is 6 hours long where the other two range between 2 - 3 hours.  The longer film allowed the director to follow the book a lot more closely than the previous two attempts had managed.  The story, as adapted by Andrew Davies (Bridget Jones' Diary, screenplay) was very Austenesque and not hollywoodized in a any way.Secondly the cast was superb.  Colin Firth as Fitzwilliam Darcy was an inspired bit of casting.  He didn't just play the part, he was Mr. Darcy.  Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth was also fantatstic.  She had just the right touch of innocence mixed with playfulness.  The chemistry between Ehle and Firth reminded me of Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable in Gone with the Wind.And last but not least was the sets and cosumes.  You truly believe that they are in the 18th century.  One of my favourite scenes is the ball at Netherfield which shows off the costumes to perfection.I highly recommend this movie. It is one of my favourites and you don't have to be an Austen fan to enjoy the fine writing and acting to be found here.	5.0	The Best Pride &amp; Prejudice Apaption to Film	2001-11-06	2	2	0

Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle handle the dialogue (which came from one of the most beloved novels in the English language) with such ease and finesse that I'm very much convinced that I'm watching Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy in the flesh.

The humour in the situations arising, and the folly of the characters is rendered so entirely believeable by an exceptional cast, Miss Austen herself could have no complaints.Colin Firth pulls off a creditable Fitzwilliam Darcy, and Jennifer Ehles brings Elizabeth Bennet to life, but the prizes have to go to David Bamber and Alison Steadman, portraying respectively, the most sycophantic Mr Collins, and the most inane Mrs Bennet one can imagine. Rest assured you will love to hate both of them.I do however caution anyone using a DVD-ROM rather than a set-top player to view their DVD's that this encoding is not the best. Instead of encoding from the original film it was taken from video tapes, with reversed fields, making movement, when viewed at the higher refresh and resolution of a PC monitor, to cause tearing across colour borders. I own the DVD's and love them, but I have to set up my DVD playing software to counteract this problem each time. If you're using a set-top player or know your software well then you'll be happy with this edition.A stunning production, well written, beautifully acted, and perfectly captured on film. I would recommend this production to anyone.[Update, September 2001: Apparently a region 1 version of this region-free DVD is coming this month - I'd recommend you go for that as the region-free version is the one with the terrible encoding]	4.0	Stunning Production, Dreadful Encoding.	2000-08-13	2	2	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2X4D0Y2AZJKYJ	MilliMoo	This is a wonderful series.  A clean love story with historical themes intertwined.  Although lacking in action or adventure (not a bad thing), this series is NOT lacking in good solid acting.  (It's easy to get angry, flustered, or happy with the various actors and actresses, as they make they characters very believable.)  While I already own a copy (given as a gift), this set was ordered for my in-laws.  I love this series and have watched it on three different occasions... and will be watching it again.If you're looking for a great story that has believable acting and an interesting plot, this is a great series to own or give as a gift.NOTE: After the second or third show, I have a hard time turning it off; like a good book that is hard to put down.	5.0	A crew of actors that can actually act	2013-05-22	0	0	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A4PI4DZJSVF6Q	Miss B	"This is by light years THE best adaptation of Jane Austen's novel that exists.  Of course, no film (or mini series) is ever entirely 100% faithful to the original text, but the A&E series makes such small changes that you hardly notice...and then it flows too well for you to care.  Such can not be said of the other adaptations out there ESPECIALLY the newest one with Kiera Knightley...I've only seen the previews of this and even that makes me shudder.  The story is utterly re-written and does not have the same ""feel"" of the original novel.  And besides all that, Colin Firth is sooo very handsome and dashing.  Please, if you plan on seeing the new film version of this wonderful novel, then watch this mini-series first.  I guarantee you that nothing else could hold a candle to it.  Nothing!

Janis	This production is absolutely perfect - both my marginally interested husband and 10-year old daughter were drawn in entirely.Jennifer Ehle is mesmerizing as Elizabeth - you literally cannot take your eyes off of her in any scene - and Colin Firth is brilliant as Mr. Darcy, whose every subtle gesture is an absolutely perfect puzzle to Elizabeth (is it indignant brooding, judgment and disapproval - or just the painful awkwardness of a man smitten?).The director has been as true to the text as a reader could wish, but has taken some forgivable liberties toward the end with the Lydia/Wickham story in order to meet the creative challenge posed by so much storytelling-through-letters near the end of the book.  The dialogue is sparkling, the scenery, costumes and tiny details are genius (the wordless Mr. Hurst forever passed out in a drunken stupor, Lydia playing with the epaulets on a soldier's uniform, inflection adjusted as servants creep in the background), and the performance of David Bamber as Mr. Collins is beyond comical; his effeminate gestures and endess gushing read volumes into the devil's bargain made by Charlotte in marrying him. Barbara Leigh-Hunt is an amazing Lady Catherine - her performance satisfies in every way.There is no greater reward (for this female viewer at least) than arriving at Pemberley and finally seeing the expression of abject, unconcealed and unmistakable love on Mr. Darcy's face as he hears Elizabeth singing.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AI703KIZFFH5H	M. Masumoto	"The 1995 BBC/A&E; Pride and Prejudice is already considered a classic. With a top-notch script, beautiful costumes and production design, sensitive direction and editing, and superb performances, this 6 episode TV dramatization of Pride and Prejudice is arguably the most faithful and engaging adaptation of Jane Austen's work ever created... and certainly the sexiest.Until the release of this 2009 Blu-Ray edition, however, there had not been a definitive transfer of this film... not even in the original TV broadcasts, which, though fairly vibrant, suffered from less-than-perfect film processing and sound. To put it bluntly, the original prints of this film looked and sounded a little cheap, especially as transferred to video masters for broadcast.Although the commercial VHS transfer was watchable, subsequent DVD incarnations were terrible, especially the widescreen ""Special Edition"" transfer which featured washed-out color and poor picture quality.Thank Heaven for this 2009 Blu-Ray release! The film has been completely remastered from the original negative by an expert with good taste and judgment. The digital color correction and toning are superb, vastly superior to the original film print, and the attention to detail is evident. Sequences glow with the richness of the fabrics, the reflections, the candlelight, the sunshine... brass highlights look different from glass highlights which look different from skin highlights which look different from cloth highlights. The toning of each scene (where the general color palette is set, yellow-ish for candlelight, blue-ish for cold, etc) is subtle and appropriate. Everything in the picture looks crisp and fresh, the colors are rich and vibrant and clearly differentiated... you can even see variations in skin tones between different characters! Color and picture fidelity this beautiful is no accident, and requires great care and sophistication and taste. Vincent Ardutto (sp?), who oversaw this Blu-Ray transfer, is a real artist and should be commended for his superior work.In short, this Blu-Ray edition makes the film look like a million bucks, and certainly must be considered the definitive printing of this movie. It revealed the lavishness of the production, which had been severely obscured in previous digital releases, and gives it a gloss which made me think of Dr Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia (which had not been the case in its original outing on TV).The sound quality, too, has been cleaned and polished in a manner which leaves me full of admiration. The music sounds rich and full, and the voice tracks are spotless. The original soundtrack had some tape-induced bobbles in the music and imperfect sound in some passages. Now, the sound is pristine and rich and wonderful.This Blu-Ray transfer is really a miracle! I can't recommend it enough.

This miniseries manages to capture the spirit of Jane Austen's novel without sacrificing any major plot points or characters throughout.  In  fact, it was this series that first got me hooked on Austen.  You will  delight in the locations and period costumes, and I guaruntee that you will  laugh at such characters as Mr. Collins.  The parallel love stories between  Elizabeth and Darcy and Jane and Bingley are charming and sweet, and it  just goes to show that love stories can be told without actors ripping each  other's clothes off in fits of passion. All in all, very comical, sweet,  and definitely worth owning.  You won't be disappointed.	5.0	Perfect series that rarely strays from book	1999-12-15	5	4	1

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1M17X9Y0L6FBV	M. Musselman	I have to add my 2 cents about this adaptaion.  It's really hard to turn a terrific novel into a film since they are totally different mediums, but this film does a great job of staying true to the spirit of the book.  Excellent casting, great direction and who can be more Mr. Darcy than Colin Firth??My favorite thing about this version is that Jane Austen's humor is not really in her dialog; it's in the comments she makes as the 3rd person narrator.  This version takes the best lines from the novel and turns them into dialog (and makes really smart choices about who should say what) so Jane Austen's humor really comes through.I suppose the new version is a good enough movie on its own, but for a true Jane Austen fan, it's too far removed from the novel.  If you love the novel, then this is the film adaptation for you!	5.0	A pleasure for any Jane Austen fan.	2006-07-24	5	5	0

Yes, the writers, producers, cast and crew did an outstanding job, blah, blah, blah, but it's Collin Firth's performance as the proud and sexy Mr. Darcy that keeps my girlfriends and me coming back for a yearly encore. The man was made for this role--he oozes that smoldering masculinity, pure chivalrous romance that just doesn't exist any more. It's not in what he says, it's in what he doesn't say.

I did notice a great improvement in the color enhancement with this edition as opposed to the enhanced edition.  My only criticism of this resored edition is that it is separated into 6 individual segments as was the original mini series so if you are watching one of the DVD's in it's entirety, the movie is interupted several times with rolling the credits.  The enhanced version did not interupt the movie at all during the viewing of a DVD.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3RINLIDX74QLP	"Monika ""equestrienne_23"""	I'm almost ashamed to admit that it wasn't until a few months ago that I first read Jane Austen's novel, Pride and Prejudice. It had been on my &quot;to read&quot; list for quite some time, but for whatever reason I just never got around to reading it earlier. When I finally started it, I found I could not put it down, and I finished the book in a little more then one day's time. I loved it. Pride and Prejudice instantly ranked high among my favorite pieces of classic literature. Having already seen and very much enjoyed the movie Bridget Jones's Diary (a modern-day adaptation of Pride and Prejudice) in which Colin Firth plays a modern Mr. Darcy, I was very eager to see this highly acclaimed BBC version of Pride and Prejudice, with Firth as the original Darcy.This movie version of the classic story was everything I hoped for and more. It is the most direct book-to-movie adaptation of any novel I've ever seen, with the filmmakers adhering almost without exception to the original storyline. Even the dialogue relies heavily on direct quotes from the book. I have only noticed three very minor deviances, all of which I feel actually enhance the story, rather than detractng from it:(1) The opening shot of the movie, showing Darcy and Bingley riding across the countryside on their horses to look at the Netherfield estate, is not included in the book, which opens with the Bennet family learning of Mr. Bingley's arrival there.(2) The scene in which the tormented Darcy throws himself into the pond at Pemberley and emerges, to stop the hearts of many a female viewer, in a deliciously clinging wet shirt is, needless to say, not in the book.(3) The end of the movie, showing Elizabeth and Darcy's wedding, is another addition to the story, though I found it most welcome, as the book left me wanting a little more closure, which the movie provides.The entire cast is unbeatable, with every actor and actress turning in a flawless performance. Jennifer Ehle is the perfect Elizabeth, and captured her character exactly as it had been in my head while reading the book. Her small nuances of facial expression display all the depths of Lizzy's personality in a way I can imagine few other actresses being able to accomplish. Likewise, Colin Firth is the ideal Mr. Darcy. I can't imagine any other actor doing as well. He manages to convey a wide range of emotions while remaining austere and short on words. The actors and actresses playing the shrill Mrs. Bennet, the delightful Mr. Bennet, the good-hearted Jane, the frivolous Lydia, the prudish Mary, the simple but loveable Mr. Bingley, the fearsome Lady Catherine de Bourgh, the imbecilic Mr. Collins, and the rogueish Whickham are all equally good.My one major disappointment with this DVD is the poor picture quality, which alternates between bad and even worse (and hence why I've knocked half a point off of my rating). At best it is a little fuzzy, and at worst it is sometimes downright grainy. The color balance also fluctuates. I would have liked to have seen this touched up more, as it would have completed an otherwise perfect viewing experience. Despite the poor image quality, however, I would highly recommend this film version of Pride and Prejudice to any fan of the novel, and even to those who have not read the book, as it follows the novel so precisely. Definitely two thumbs up!	5.0	(4.5) The best book-to-movie adaptation I've ever seen!	2004-01-20	2	2	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A236ZML0RERCY8	mozzie	There is an absolutely hilarious scene about an hour or so into the series.  The bennett family is at a village gathering. The whole family (except Jane) has by turns rendered Elizabeth speechless with embarrassment--in front of the ever proud Mr Darcy.The youngest daughter has lambasted the assembly with a musical performance to rival the worst Idol's Simon has endured. The middle sisters have invented a new level of crassness to the art of flirting.  Mr Collins, the ever unctuous, has committed a horrendous faux pas - a scene that makes one realize what a great actor Colin Firth is, how DID he manage to keep a straight face.  And to top it off Mr Collins is about to threaten the company with a musical encore to rival the youngest sister's now infamous performance, when the eldest Bingley sister rushes up to the piano and furiously plays a Mozart sonata.Ever into the breach, the magic of Mozart.This movie/series has it all.  Austen authenticity, riots of laughter, unmatched social commentary by way of brilliantly witty dialogue (all of it direct from the original writer's lips), great performances, and at its heart the best love story ever.  Best casting of leads in recent memory.	5.0	mozart to the Rescue	2003-02-17	2	2	0

I understand that this was made for television in the days before HD, but if you are used to watching HD, this DVD seems like very poor quality. Like other reviews, I also had to change my TV settings to put color saturation to the maximum, which means that brown and navy become black, but at least you can differentiate pale faces from lace collars. I have a 34 inch wide screen television and this is the first time I have ever been grateful NOT to have a larger screen.If these issues are resolved with Blu-Ray, maybe it is time to start saving for a Blu-Ray player.	3.0	Video quality still poor in Special Edition	2009-12-11	2	1	1

( and have loaned it to SO many friends ) All the characters are richly delved, and once I started watching each movie, I was hooked. ( got miffed that I had to shut of the darn movie to go to work! lol ) Set in Regency England, Colin Firth was born to play Mr. Darcy, with all his character's arrogance and smoldering good looks. Jennifer Ehle is Elizabeth Bennet, whom Mr. Darcy dismisses at his friend's ball as a woman beneath his state.  There are secrets, silly family members ( Have to confess to wanting to use a tranquilizer dart on Mrs. Bennet ), and unexpected surprises and intrigues.  Darcy and Elizabeth's road to happiness is not easy, but well worth the wait.	5.0	Enthralling and Romantic  Movie	2008-04-22	2	2	0

Wheeler	Because this is my favorite version of the film, I've wanted to buy it since first seeing it on PBS. I held off in the hopes that one day it would be available on blu-ray. When that day came, I waited for a reasonable price, then made my purchase.I'm a bit disappointed with the blu-ray version. I'm sure if I were to compare it side by side with the regular dvd, that I'd see significant improvement, however, in viewing it on its own....Close up shots are extremely crisp and focused, but long range shots have a graininess to them (for instance, the opening sequence where we see the estate in the background). Many other scenes throughout have that same graininess. I've become accustomed to crystal clear imagery with blu-ray discs, and due to the medium, minor imperfections become obvious. As with some other reviewers, I have no issue with the colors.I had been waiting to buy Emma (2009 version) on blu-ray, but now I think I'll purchase it on regular dvd.

All the way around the characters are depicted in true form to Austin's novel.  Putting aside the obvious main characters (Firth &amp; Ehle), Mr. Collins, Mrs. Bennett, and  Bingly's sister were exceptionally well cast.  Their exaggerations are down  right funny, greasy, overbearing like Austin wanted to portray.  Makes one  want to wrinkle their nose disghust and shame but yet bellow with laughter  at the same time. The cast chosen for this piece was perfectly done. I  flatter myself; as Collins would say; to recommend this video series to  anyone with social graces.	5.0	I Flatter myself with such condesentions!	1999-12-20	6	6	0

But I must write about how ardently I admire and love the BBC/A&E; production.The key for any production of P&P; is that the reader (or in this case, the viewer) should fall in love with Elizabeth within minutes, otherwise it will never work. She's a fabulous character - smart, witty, a good friend and sister, aware of her limitations (well, at least her musical ones), and confident enough to challenge the deserving Mr. Darcy. Jennifer Ehle is a perfect Elizabeth. And Colin Firth as Darcy - oh........ Loved him! Excellent supporting cast as well, especially Allison Steadman as a hilarious Mrs. Bennet and whoever played Catherine De Bourgh (her scene with Elizabeth in the garden is a highlight), and wonderful production design.Watching P&P; also demonstrates that the only way to do Austen justice is by adapting her novels into miniseries. Nothing is left out, and we can get to know and love the characters - or not love them, depending on what they deserve!P&P; should be required reading for everyone (especially romance writers!), and the miniseries should be required viewing for everyone. It's a joy.Also Recommended: Sense and Sensibility, though it's not as good; and P&P; the novel.	5.0	The best miniseries and historical production - Perfect.	2004-12-27	3	3	0

After seven years of absolutely savoring this film, I still get goose-bumps when Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennet finally, and at long last, share a kiss. Having read the book for the first time at the age of twelve, and then rereading it countless times since, I have become ingrained with each characters' personality. So much so, that if this version had been miscast, I would have been up in arms. As it is, it is like the producer, director, casting director, and costume designer gazed into my own imagination and made what I had envisioned into this one, perfect movie. The two main roles, played by Colin Firth(Darcy) and Jennifer Ehle(Elizabeth)are so accurate that it is as if Miss Austen had reappeared to inspire them. Mr. Firth, in particular, gives Darcy such depth and interest that I would not wish it on any future actor to even attempt reviving the part. Miss Ehle transmits through Lizzy, humour, warmth, passion, and a believable sensitivity without being too sweet. The rest of the cast is also excellent. The music is true to the times, as is the dancing. The countryside is gorgeous, the homes exquisite. All in all, a classic interpretation of a true classic.	5.0	Jane Austen Perfection	2002-07-10	0	0	0

Colin Firth as Mr Darcy and Jennifer Ehle  as Elizabeth Bennet give a truly memorable performance. Both of the  chracters imbed themselves into the veiwers minds and in a way transports  the veiwer back in time. In fact all the actors give a superb performance.

Unfortunately, this DVD release doesn't have too many such features.  However, I find myself enjoying the movie too much to fault the DVD release itself for the lack of extras.  As others have said, it's quite an enjoyable movie.  The fact that it follows the book very closely, and therefore is several hours long, only adds to its overall charm.I also like turning on subtitles, so while there is no subtitle of any kind available on the DVD (a disappointment), I found that allowing the TV to activate its Closed Caption feature did allow the text of the dialogue to be visible.

The casting is marvelous and the script follows the novel so closely one might be reading it aloud.  The cast delivers the 19th century dialogue so naturally it seems they truly belong in that era. Although the roles of Elizabeth and Darcy have received the most acclaim, Mr. Bennett is a special delight, delivering his ironies with the perfect mixture of mockery and wit. Wickham achieves the proper balance of charm and perfidy; Mr. Collins of pomposity and foolishnish; Bingley of boyish enthusiam and bonhomie. The extra features on the DVD are informative, especially the one about the care taken in reproducing the costumes and mannerisms of the day.	5.0	A production for Jane Austen devotees	2013-02-22	0	0	0

However, from a DVD-buying standpoint, this DVD ""Special Edition"" is somewhat of a disappointment.  I admit it.  I own both DVD editions, so I think I can speak fairly on the comparison.COLOR:  As for England being bleak and dreary in real life, just as it appears in this version, fine, but it doesn't explain for why England was bright and vibrant before this Special Edition came out.  It's like someone (messed) with the ""Tint"" and ""Brightness"" adjustment on my TV.  Hello!  You call that ""enhanced"" picture?!SPECIAL FEATURES:  For all this film's popularity that initiated the release of a Special Edition, there's only ONE notable Special Feature...  the Behind The Scenes/Making Of- featurette.  The other features I could've done without.  Personally I'm not into reading miniscule passages off my TV screen.What would've made it better:  a director's commentary track.  Or an actor.  Heck, commentary track from a gaffer or the ubiquitous Best Boy would've made this purchase worth it.  Or, how about deleted scenes?  Like the one where Lizzy kicks Caroline Bingley's (...)? (just kidding)I understand that they no longer make the ""Regular"" edition (or in this case, the *better* edition).  If you care about the cinematic aspects of the film, it's worth the trouble of tracking the older DVD edition.  Buy this only if you ""must have"" the Behind The Scenes vignette.Regardless, this is still a superior and well-executed adaptation.

It is spectacular in its scope and depiction of Regency England.  The sheer length of the production allows it to do more justice to Jane Austen's book than any mere 2hour movie could do.  With that said, it has one very serious drawback - there is not enough about Darcy and Elizabeth.  Instead, the movie is awkwardly tilted to focus on Mr. Collins.  The movie leaves out many thoughts and interactions of Darcy and Elizabeth relating to each other and yet these are the main characters of the movie and the main characters of one of the most amazing love stories ever written.  Consequently, it helps to have read the book at least once if not more times so that you can fill in the missing encounters, thoughts and dialogue.  Nonetheless, after repeated viewings, I simply fast-forwarded through most of Mr. Collins' scenes which really highlighted how much of the movie disproportionately focused on him.  But because of the resources that went into the film, the quality of the actors, and the attention to the detail of the period, this production still remains the best.  The ""extra"" material is useless (as it is in the anniversary version so buy this cheaper one)."	4.0	The best of all the versions	2008-10-22	3	2	1

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A774UFN2MCGPG	N. M. Hartley	I'm still not sure why I waited so long to buy this movie -- it sat on my wish list for quite a while until I decided to make the investment. If you read the book and enjoyed it, do yourself a favor and buy this DVD collection! It's almost identical to the novel.In order to do Austen's work proper justice, a mini-series couldn't have been a better choice. No effort was wasted in the production, and had it been standard film-length, ample character development and some goodies from the novel might have been left out. Everything from the clothing to the music is faithful to the period, and the acting is wonderful. Another plus: the cast isn't nauseatingly full of gorgeous actors and actresses. The characters are believable, true to their literary counterparts, and truly seem like people you might find in the late 1700s/early 1800s. If you can't stand Keira Knightley as Elizabeth, Jennifer Ehle sticks to her role and to the true spirit of Elizabeth. Colin Firth has been the lasting face of Darcy for a reason; he does a remarkable job of conveying the character's personality and complexities.My only complaints are incredibly nitpicky, but two things nagged me throughout the film. First, Susannah Harker seemed a little too soft-spoken, even if the literary Jane was very gentle. She could have put just a little more 'umph' into her character; her performance felt somewhat lacking. Second -- something which amused instead of bothered me -- Caroline, Bingley's sister, looked like a cross-dresser most of the time. Maybe it's just me, but I hope someone else noticed that as well.Overall, this movie is an excellent buy, and luckily it's been made to watch in shifts if you can't, or don't feel like, sitting through all six hours in one run.	5.0	Go ahead and buy it--you know you want to.	2007-07-01	7	6	1

It bothered me that the credits ran every 50 minutes and that there were no extras, so I was so excited about the new &quot;special edition&quot; DVD.  I ordered it right away.  When I got it, I couldn't wait to watch the featurette... but first I had to watch some of the movie.I was SOOOO disappointed!  The picture quality was abysmal!  The contrast was set so high that all the characters looked sickly.  Also, their dark hair would just blend with dark backgrounds, creating just an all around terrible picture.At first I thought it was just the DVD, but then I watched the featurette, which was fine.  The featurette had clips from the film and it was so nice to see the characters looking robust and the backgrounds lush again.My advice: if you must have the DVD, try to get your hands on the non-special edition.I plan on sending a letter of complaint to the distributors, and would suggest others who are disappointed do the same.  Perhaps if enough people complain, they will re-remaster it or un-remaster it, so it looks the way it should.	2.0	Special Edition DVD is not so special after all	2001-10-18	11	9	2

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2JLK1SQ8O03EO	octobercountry	"This 1995 six-part production of Pride and Prejudice is easily my favourite of the four different films that I've seen which are based on the novel; really, it's a complete delight and I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen the series as of yet.The new Blu-ray release looks spectacular; this is a new scan taken directly from the original super 16 mm negative.  Now, I've heard some people commenting (in disparaging tones) that in this transfer the film looks extremely grainy, but I honestly have to disagree.  There is some very fine film grain visible throughout, which is inherent to the super 16 format, but it is minimal in my opinion.  I'm watching this on a fifty inch plasma set, and the grain is barely noticeable (I've seen 35 mm films which looked much grainier), so for me this is not an issue at all.One major difference between this release, and the earliest video transfers of the series, is that the aspect ratio of the image has been changed in the new version. (See the comparison photos that accompany Amazon's product information.)  I suppose I don't mind losing a bit of the picture off of the top and bottom of the frame, when so much more is added to the sides. Though the question is, why couldn't the ENTIRE frame be included? I suppose it's because people with wide-screen televisions want the entire screen to be filled with an image. Super 16 has an aspect ratio of 1.66:1, while high-definition televisions have an aspect ratio of 1.78:1----so, if the entire film frame was shown, there would be thin black bars on each side of the picture when viewed on a wide-screen television.  I personally would have preferred to see the film in the 1.66:1 aspect ratio, but as it is, the picture does not appear to be unduly cropped on the top and bottom of the frame.Okay, enough of the tech talk; let's just say the picture looks fantastic; I don't think anyone has ever seen this film looking this good previously.I have only a few minor quibbles with this adaptation... let's see.... Well, there's the fact that Julia Sawalha as Lydia is perhaps a bit too old for the part. And I think she plays the character a bit too much in ""lusty serving wench"" mode, as compared to just being an extremely thoughtless, selfish, and air-headed young girl... Susannah Harker is, I think, quite lovely and absolutely perfect as Jane, but physically she looks nothing at all like any of the other four girls who played the Bennet sisters; she's a completely different physical type, and it's difficult to believe that she is related to the rest of the Bennets... Miss Bingley and Mrs Hurst were perhaps not quite as well-behaved as they ought to have been; I've always had the impression that they would have had quite impeccable manners, even as they were cutting you dead... And I perhaps have a few other small reservations, but these are as nothing compared to the overall enjoyment I get from this picture; it's a fantastic film.(I always get a laugh out of how so many female viewers swoon over Mr Darcy. Oh, he's attractive enough I suppose, but I always thought that Crispin Bonham-Carter as Mr Bingley was far more appealing.)The Blu-ray has a few interesting extras, including an hour-long programme that contains a lot of interviews with members of the cast. It's interesting to see how people have changed in the years since the film was made---some people have aged very well indeed, and others terribly! My only disappointment is that the small amount of extra ""behind the scenes"" material that was on the old special edition DVD is not also included on this new release."	5.0	Blu-ray Pride and Prejudice	2009-04-21	5	5	0

That is a wonderful presentation of the Jane Austen classic.  I was not sure that an updated version would be as enjoyable, but it was excellent.  This is a longer presentation and shows both Jane and Elizabeth getting married.The 1985 version is presented in a more reserved, understated fashion.  I think this is indicative of the interpretation of the era in which the story takes place.  The 1995 version is more lively and modernized to a degree.I would not recommend one over the other, as I think they are both superb presentations and well worth the watching.  I can honestly say that neither apeals to me more than the other.Treat yourself and enjoy them both.	5.0	Review of April 2010 release ...	2010-08-02	3	1	2

The only negatives (and these are minor) are that the costumes could have been better and that Jennifer Ehle played Elizabeth as slightly too reserved. The character is an out-going, somewhat bubbly, very young woman after all. I should probably hide under a table for daring to say anything not just glowing about this version.

But  we found him asking for more!I read the book shortly after I had  finished watching it for about the fourth time--and I was not regretful.  Watching the movie before reading the book only made reading easier,  because I had clear images of the readers in my mind.This movie was well  done and well directed.

"If you like Jane Austen, and especially if you like BBC recreations of classic British Literature, you will love this program.  The leads are perfectly cast, even Colin Firth, who seems to ""warm"" to the role as the series progresses.  Much of the dialogue is straight out of the novel, and most major plot elements are incorporated to some extent, so this miniseries is much ""closer"" to the book than any one-sitting movie could possibly accomplish.  The well-chosen sets, as well as the direction, costuming, and artful cinematography bring the period to life as few other movies have accomplished.  To people who are used to every story arc wrapping up within ninety minutes or all characters wearing their hearts on their sleeves, this program may seem plodding and overly reserved.  To fans of British literature and of Austen in particular, the miniseries format gives us precious extra time with many old and new friends.P.S. The 2005 theatrical release with Keira Knightly is also very good and very well cast. My only concern is that the first hour is so rushed to try to get the story elements in.  This version gives you time to really get to know the characters and removes the sense that everything in Jane Austen occurs at a dead run (which it certainly does not)."	5.0	The long version gives the characters time to inhale.	2004-08-27	0	0	0

The cast is perfect, it is beautifully shot, and the script is very true to the spirit of the book. I have since seen other filmed versions of ""Pride and Prejudice"" but it is this one that I continue to come back to.

My brothers especially, since  they were the newcomers to the story -- I would explain a scene before it  came on so that they could appreciate all of the nuances of each  characters' reactions, and boy did they love it.  We all stayed up for the  entire 6 hours - into the late night hours and just crashed on the living  room floor.

In the best BBC  tradition this version of Pride and Prejudice is excellent both as regards to the quality of production and the careful casting.

I was so excited to see the new improved video quality of one of my favorite movies, but I have to say that I am unimpressed. I can honestly say this doesn't look any better than the original dvd version of this film, which I had just watched one week before receiving the 2010 version.On this new dvd there is a special feature interview about the process of taking the original negative to make a new print along with side by side examples of the differences. What I find funny is that those exact scenes that really did look better in the special features examples did NOT look like that when you played the actual film! So, tell me?

Gitaitis	"We have this 1995 version on VHS, the original DVD release and, unfortunately the ""new"" DVD version. The Pride and Prejudice story speaks for itself. I speak to the video creators. What is wrong with the people who produce videos for public release?  First the VHS is beautiful to look at and draws you in instantly... until you have to change tapes every 55 minutes... all SIX of them!! We all know that VHS tape could hold recordings for as long as 8 hours... here we only need about 5 1/2 hours. The story could have easily been represented on a maximum of 2 VHS tapes! Second, the first DVD release is as others have said, washed out and ""blue"" toned.  However the creators briefly got sensible and realized that fans DO NOT want to have the story chopped up and give us a 2-disc run with 3 episodes each smoothly relating the story without ""Protecting"" the directors vision by inserting every single beginning and ending of each episode vainly and pompously listing them and their ""accomplishments"".  Once is enough. Third, the latest DVD issue returns to STUPID! You get 2 DVDs with every single break between episodes with all the listings for all of the directors, writers and producers at the beginning and end. The first DVD in this version ends awkwardly and you pick up the end of the story with disc 2. You cannot even select a ""PLAY ALL"" option to have the story just play out as you watch. Disc 2 is a WASTE!  As a fan, I am NOT interested in more information on the director, producers, writers than there is story!!!  When are these pompous, vain people going to get a clue?!?  I want the STORY... simple, without interruption, with clarity and logically. The extra ""making of"" JUNK should have been put on a disc by itself.  Also, disc 1 has so much of the story on it, it is quite possible that if the DVD creators has NOT felt compelled to include all of the introduction and ending credits, the WHOLE story could have been included on ONE DVD!!!!  OMG what a concept!  The story for the story's sake!I will wait until the price of DVD recorders drops, put in my VHS and record it on a DVD myself.

This is the only version I've ever seen that actually shows the four kids that her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner brought to Longbourne before the trip to Pemberley that _is_ mentioned in the book.  The only faults I found were the casting of Lizzie's oldest and youngest sister, supposed to be the most beautiful and the youngest and TALLEST respectively according to the book (nobody gets Lydia's casting right that way).

This is a tale about a British family that does not have a male heir, but instead has five girls. A wealthy man, Mr. Bingley, buys a home there and soon the town is all a buzz. To welcome the new resident they decide to have a ball in his honor. At the ball Mr. Bingley meets Jane. He is captivated by her beauty and sweet demeanor. His friends however do nothing to hide their disdain for such middle class foolery. Bingley tries to get Darcy to dance with Elizabeth, Jane's sister, he makes a snide comment about Lizzie's plainess and refuses to dance. What they do not realize is that Lizzie had heard his comments. Now she is disposed to dislike him. He on the other hand takes a second look and decides he likes what he sees, but she will not give him the time of day. Throughout the movie they dance around each other, dancing the steps of two very independent people learning to overcome social barriers and preconcieved ideas to find love where they least expect. Wonderful script, characters, and performances. It is fun to see Mr. Darcy overcome his pride and Lizzie her prejudice. This movie is well worth watching.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3KM9UA6MAVURN	"pjf ""pjf"""	"This review is specifically related to the blu ray version.  If you're looking for an always crystal clear and sharp version of this classic on blu-ray, akin to a new release movie in blu ray, you will find this wanting.  I don't normally buy multiple versions of movies, and I happen to also have this on VHS and regular DVD.  But I have always been frustrated by the grainy, poor resolution of this otherwise great movie, a problem that seems typical of many BBC productions.  I so wanted to see this in good resolution that I bought the blu ray to play on my 42"" LG 1080p TV and LG blu ray player in LG's top of the line home theater system. The results, for me, were mixed.The resolution is better than it was.  But there's still noticible graininess in the transfer, and fuzziness in most scenes. I don't know whether it is the lenses they used to shoot, the lighting, or the camera, or perhaps just a choice to deliberately shoot scenes slightly out of focus.  But the hoped for jump to always sharp 1080p HD resolution just isn't there.  Outdoor scenes seemed noticibly better to me than indoor ones -- perhaps it was lighting in many of those historic sites or they used different camera there. Or perhaps there was a deliberate design to shoot scenes slightly out of focus.  But I still felt frustrated.  Take the simplest example -- the opening credits, shot over scenes of embroidery and clothing.  These have always been in soft focus.  You could never really see the detail of the threadwork or workmanship because the items were fuzzy, and for no good reason.  Why shoot them in close up but in soft focus? I had thought the poor resolution was the transfer from film to VHS or DVD. But they are still not in focus in blu ray, so it can't be the transfer.If you can't get focus on a still shot it doesn't bode well for the actual filming. And unfortunately you can see visible graininess in many indoor and some outdoor scenes. However, some outdoor scenes actually do look startlingly sharp and clear. You get to those scenes and think perhaps the transfer was better than you had thought, and wonder if your perceptions before were wrong. But then the focus goes out again in the next scene change.  I realized the focus is just uneven. You can actually see the focus jump from sharp to fuzzy as scenes change. I even thought there was also some shakiness at times in the film, where the focus seems to go in and out in the same scene, either from camerawork or I don't know what. This is not a scenario that I've experienced on any other blu ray disc, so I think it is just a factor of how this move was shot or transferred. It's just not consistent. Some scenes have clearly visible graininess. Some seem to have terrible focus. Some are sharp and clear. It's a mix.There is a little featurette on the transfer process to HD that describes the problems they experienced and how they overcame them -- at least in part. Certainly this blu ray transfer is better than the standard definition. But I can't say it is great or comparable to a blu ray release of a current movie.  Probably it is as good as they can do with an old film shot for TV and the current technology.As for the other attributes with this edition, there are a few new featurettes, including a location ""walkabout"" with the actors who played Wickam and Mary that gave you a chance to see the ""Longbourne"" location set as it is now. I haven't watched all the new featurettes, but there are some new ones to add to the value of the blu ray edition.The audio to me did not seem markedly improved.So is this worth purchasing? The price is certainly reasonable, and the transfer is a bit better, so I'd say yes.  I don't think you'll be disappointed if you come into it with limited expectations, which is the point of this review. I was really hoping for a finally sharp, clear, non grainy, high definition version of this movie to marvel at, akin to a typical blu ray release of a current movie. You just aren't going to see that, so it is better not to expect it.  I don't know what the problem is -- again if not the transfer, it may just be the film or the lenses or lighting used or a deliberate decision to shoot some scenes in soft focus.  So for this blu ray edition, expect something better  -- because it is better -- but it's not great. Then you won't be too disappointed."	3.0	blu ray version	2010-01-06	13	8	5

Mullins ""Austenite"""	I have to say right away that I am a Jane Austen fan, so my opinion is definitely in favor of this film version with Colin FIrth and Jennifer Ehle.  Colin Firth's performance as the iconic Mr. Darcy is spot on and his performance set the bar very high for subsequent actors.  He nailed the character's mood perfectly, and Jane herself would probably consider him swoon-worthy.  Jennifer Ehle's performance was equally superior to any I have ever seen, past or present.  She truly looked the part as described by Austen.  The supporting cast members all gave wonderful performances.

This is one of the great novels of the language.  I enjoyed it immensely several years before seeing any of the movies.  I have never laughed out loud and let out so many exclamations of shear enthusiasm while reading any other novel.  I am no Janite, having read the novel only twice, but I had high standards in anticipating any movie adaptation.  Please read the novel!Now I can honestly get to the movie.  This is a great adaptation.  I can hardly be more enthusiastic.  The presence of Colin Firth in this adaptation is wonderful. (I wonder what a young Cary Grant would have done with this role?).  No question I would recommend this one over the 1980's BBC version.  Jennifer Ehle is a delight as Elizabeth.  One word of caution - men may want to keep this away from their wives - mine wore out the VHS tapes I bought when this version was first available, so I had to buy the DVD - and there is the distinct chance you may become somewhat sick of hearing about how wonderful Firth/ Darcy is.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2UNTTDX3D8QP2	Poetkitty	I can only echo what others have written - both praise and censure! This adaptation is very faithful to the novel and omits nothing - which is good if one hasn't read the novel, and a little condescending if one has. There are subtler ways of expounding upon ones poverty without Mrs. Bennet shrieking about it, Lizzy and Jane talking about it, and Mr. Bennet tallying up his expense sheet with a worried expression! Some aspects are over-explained to us ignorant, contemporary audiences! Mrs. Bennet is over-the-top to the extent that one can only wonder 'what arts of allurement' she used on Mr. Bennet! Jane, I'm sorry to say, is so plain, that to hear her spoken of as 'five times prettier' than the rest of the Bennet girls, is just upsetting! Lizzy has too much makeup on, and seems, as said before, much older than 20. There is little chemistry between Jane and Bingley and Mary is too ugly. The Bingley sisters are a little over-acted - such acid can burn with smaller doses!That all being said, there is much to praise. Darcy's character is well drawn - he seems, at times,  to be struggling more with shyness and confusion than superiority. You do feel that Lizzy's 'first impression' of him, though warranted, is wrong, and you can thoroughly understand her change of heart. The look that he gives her when she goes to Georgiana's aid at the piano when the awful topic of Wickham is introduced, is one of my favourite movie moments! Lizzy, though too made up and too old, has a spirit that is true to the novel - although, as before mentioned, seems, at times, a little more smug than playful and independent. Wickham's dealings with the Darcy family are excellently explained and integrated into the movie.I love the look of this adaptation and the more physical side of life it portrays. It's brighter and noisier than other adaptations - hair is blown and children run and the roads are muddy and the women don't always have perfect posture. The characters are approachable, lively, and generally believable.Worth watching and worth owning.	4.0	Satisfying	2007-08-07	3	3	0

If Jennifer Ehle had been the one to take her clothes off there might have been some point to it.That said, Firth's performance did approach the memorable character Jane Austen created, when the script allowed him to. Jane Austen's book was cracking stuff and this script would have done well not to veer so far from it. The ending is sweet enough to induce terminal toothache.	3.0	Dry humor, gone wet.	2002-06-19	18	3	15

I was most annoyed with the ""Featurette"" which was supposed to cover ""The Making of Pride and Prejudice"", which, as one reviewer already mentioned, talked to only 2 of the stars (minor ones at that) and the other areas it touched on (choreography, script) were incredibly superficial.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2CMYX10636NG2	Portia	"This may very well be not only the definitive adaptation of Austen's classic book, but it just might prove to be the definitive adaptation of ANY book, ever!Never has a movie (in my mind) so wholly captured the feel, pace, atmosphere and original dialogue before. Although the film would have to be even longer than it is to include every single moment of Austen's masterpiece, one doesn't ever feel disappointed by any omissions. In fact, the ommissions seemed to improve the continuity of the film as a whole. While staying obsessively true to the original book, this movie is able to easily stand on its own as a masterpiece of acting and direction.Don't be daunted by the length! I have watched this film more times than I can recall and been newly enchanted every time. Ehle and Firth's performances are masterful... the level of nuance and depth they bring to their characters creates the same kind of humanity and wit that Austen endowed them with.As Elizabeth, Ehle portrays a strong-willed girl who is at once thoroughly respectable and intelligent while maintaining a sort of ahead-of-her time free-spiritedness and independence. When she refuses to cooperate with Lady Catherine, you can see a flash in her eyes that demands respect while daring opposition.Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy overcomes the temptation of so many actors to merely be ""brooding"". The intensity of just-barely suppressed passion he brings to the role makes you see the man behind the enigma. Firth makes Darcy a real person, granted a cool, intelligent, self-possessed person, but a person capable of feeling humiliation, anger and exasperation. Some of his best scenes in the film are towards the end when he begins to let his guard down because he so desperately wants Elizabeth to notice him.All of the supporting characters are impeccably cast. Alison Steadman and David Bamber as Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins, respectively, both steal almost every scene that they're in.Regency England is so perfectly recaptured in this film, that you will have trouble visualizing the actors dressed in anything other than cravats and waistcoats. This is a film that will please Austen purists and new viewers alike. The characters are immensley likeable and familiar... some of the most natural comic acting I have ever seen is in this film.See it by all means if you have the opportunity!Oh, one disappointment: the DVD version has VERY few extras... one incredibly short ""Making Of P & P"" sort of thing that leaves one wishing for more. It's a shame there's no commentary or anything. Oh well!"	5.0	too bad I can only give it 5 stars...	2003-07-20	6	6	0

The characters are so rich, even the most annoying of them has something to offer, like the irritating Mr.Collins who fits so pertfectly into the theme of how society sought patronage then.One never gets tired of the Darcy and Miss Lizzy Bennet affair that the movie is based on. Firth and Ehle execute their parts so meticulously that I for one am always left in a quandry for I don't know if it is Firth or Darcy that makes me like the movie so much. Ehle does a wonderful job of playing the witty Ms Bennet. The sets are so well made, you are taken to an age when women did nothing but gossip, make hats and wait to be betrothed. A must read book and and a must see movie.	5.0	Simply the best	2004-06-21	2	2	0

It so closely follows the  work of Austen herself that I was truly amazed.  I found myself rewinding  and replaying a part just so I could follow along with my book and count  how many lines were taken directly from the text itself.  The end wavers a  bit in the coverage, speeding the books last few chapters along, but one  hardly notices when you have such a great movie to begin with.  Jennifer  Ehle plays a wonderfully playful and smart Elizabeth Bennet, charming the  audience with her quick wit.  I would have to agree with about every other  woman who has ever seen this movie in saying that Colin Firth plays a very  sexy Mr. Darcy.  But beyond the appearence, he gives a superb performance,  which I felt completely captured what Austen was describing in her novels.  His shy nature was displayed very well indeed, as well as his ever present  PRIDE.  I love this movie, and it will forever remain a part of my video  collection.  This is one of the videos that will be moving to college with  me, for I could NEVER leave it behind!	5.0	WOW	2000-08-16	2	1	1

Well, to my amazement, I found that I truly began to like this version and realize that it had some great merits to it. I am just beginning to be a Jane Austen fan, once I gave a 5 volume set to my daughter, and found that I really enjoy the movies. I have always loved period pieces since I was a child, ones that were true to the time period in speech, clothing and the story line. So I began to watch very closely and found myself lost in the story again truly enjoying another time period in history. I would certainly recommend it to anyone who enjoys good behavior, historical costuming, old fashioned manners and etiquette and an intriguing story line between men and women. My teenage daughter and I love to watch when all the other ""men"" in our house are away and we can spend some hours together!

There is nothing in the product description here telling me why this is being re-released, but the technical specs say this is a 4:3 fullscreen version. Is it cropped? Pan and Scan? Do they even make High Definition TVs that are 4:3? Or does the widescreen version actually crop some of the original footage (i.e. was this originally filmed in 4:3 so that the 4:3 is the ""real"" version)? (That last scenario seems highly unlikely, since at least according to imdb Pan and Scan versions of this film have been made in the past - that would seem unnecessary if the original film was 4:3.) Or are the technical specs some terrible mistake and there is something else unique about this re-release?[Edit: My original review also puzzled over the tech specs listing this as a single disk edition.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2PFFTL2N6B4SB	"""quia-nihil-sum"""	I should warn you straight away that once you have this wonderful DVD set in your possession you will need to keep a duster handy for the rest of your collection,as it's going to be severely neglected for some considerable period of time as you develop a virtual monomania with your latest treasure.In fact if you are not entirely closeted and consumed with it for at least a fortnight to begin with,I'll be most surprised and lost in admiration for your extraordinary willpower and self-denial.The original six episodes of the TV broadcast have been most judiciously divided three to a disc and the transfer is as pristine and crystal clear as you could wish for -- indeed I forget sometimes that I'm watching a recording so freshly minted does it leap from my television screen.Perhaps the colour balance is not altogether truthful but I find that my eye quickly adjusted and it's not remotely an obstacle to the enjoyment of it all. The episode titles have been retained throughout and I seem to be one of the few people who actually like this arrangement.For a start I don't care how many times I am subjected to Carl Davis's lovely quasi-Mozartian theme and also the integrity of the dramatic breaks,which were obviously chosen so carefully by the producers,is preserved.Besides,I enjoy planning my evening's viewing on a &quot;per episode&quot; basis.Sometimes I'll make do with a leisurely feast of two,and occasionally I'll splurge on an all out &quot;P&amp;P&quot; binge of 4 (pretty ambitious that,and should only be attempted by advanced viewers only !). The usual menu features of chapter division and scene access are laid out with due Regency taste and style but I must admit that I haven't so far been tempted by the &quot;Making of..&quot; feature.I'm sure a lot of folks will simply lap it up but I really don't want the magic (and this BBC/A&amp;E production is fully deserving of that epithet) deconstructed before my eyes.No,let me alone in my reverie and keep reality at bay until it's time to reluctantly rejoin the 21st Century once more.What can I say of the peerless cast that hasn't been said much more succinctly elsewhere ? Jennifer Ehle richly deserves all the plaudit's and awards she has received for her exquisite portrayal of Lizzy while Colin Firth's Darcy is a very carefully considered incarnation that so delicately treads that fine line of communicating his initial haughty disdain but always letting us glimpse the genuinely warm and decent man within.A good example of his skill here is that quite lovely scene when he has to bid a temporary farewell to Elizabeth after their surprise encounter at Pemberley.All he does is bid her &quot;Good day&quot; after helping her into the carriage but the absolute maelstrom of suppressed emotion he gets across to us with an absolute minimum of facial expression and body language is marvellous to behold.If you ever want to see Shakespeare's &quot;parting is such sweet sorrow&quot; personified then all you need to do is watch him in that scene. Not only are the main roles filled to absolute perfection but the subsidiary roles are happily fleshed out to a degree that almost comes to seem supernatural.I could easily exhaust the 1000 word limit in praising them individually as they deserve but I won't test your patience on that score.My personal favourites include Susannah Harker's serenely captivating Jane;Benjamin Whitrow's paternally authoritative but mischeviously twinkling Mr Bennet;Julia Sawalha's daft,dizzy delight of a Lydia and Lucy Scott's cool and composed Charlotte.And I couldn't not mention Anna Chancellor's tour de force as the scheming Miss Bingley.She really makes the most of every scene she appears in and I almost feel sorry for her towards the end as the object of her affections slips inexorably out of her grasp.&quot;Almost&quot; -- I hasten to add ! Yet pick any role at random from principal to servant and there will you find the ideal actor for the part.Something that particularly contributes to the success of the whole piece and is especially dear to my heart is the stunning wat that music has been so wonderfully worked into the warp and weave of it's fabric.Not only is there Carl Davis's outstanding original scoring but the music of the time has been employed in the most affecting manner imaginable.Handel,Mozart,Beethoven (listen out for his &quot;Andante favori&quot; in the famous &quot;look&quot; scene over the fortepiano at Pemberley) and Paisello are all in there, as is some less familiar but no less delightful Country dance music.Especially noteworthy are the dances used at the Netherfield Ball i.e &quot;The Shrewsbury Lasses&quot; and &quot;Mr Beveridge's Maggot&quot;.The latter especially is a title that falls uneasily on modern ears perhaps but it is actually a very beautiful,courtly and stately dance that is choreographed to perfection and takes on even more significance when you consider that it is the first time that Elizabeth and Darcy take to the floor together and actually make physical contact (the opening step requires partners to exchange hands in passing) and the camera is thankfully careful to highlight this.So whether it's a visual or aural (or both) treat you want,waste no more time in buying this brilliant DVD set.I fully guarantee that you will be entertained,amused,enchanted,delighted and excessively diverted in rapid succession,and ad infinitum, thanks to this miraculous new medium of digital versatile disc.	5.0	What are you waiting for ? -- GO TO IT !	2001-03-19	9	9	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AQR22MPF45M3P	Rachel Ford	This movie is without question the best adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that I have ever seen; it is, in fact, so good that it's nearly perfect - and, for a film this length, that is a feat indeed.The characters come across so clearly that they seem almost to have been lifted from the pages of Austen's work itself; the acting is so superb that they are uncannily realistic. (The only exception to this - and it's an occasional exception - is Jane, who sometimes merely exists in the scenes, as opposed to acting her character out, even if she's only in the background, as all the others do). Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Collins are two of my favorite characters in the film - not because I actually like the characters (Mrs. Bennett is extremely annoying, and Mr. Collins downright detestable!), but because they are so convincing and horrid! The depiction of society, and its many foibles, is delightfully done as well. The sanctimony, the hypocrisy, the condescension, the pride, the arrogance, the folly - and the love, the tenderness, the forgiveness and the redemption - are much as we see them today, and much as they have been throughout the ages...and exactly as Austen saw them when she penned Pride and Prejudice.This is the classic story of misplaced pride and hasty prejudice, and how woefully the two can interact. This is a love story worthy of the name - a story of human beings and real emotions, and not the overblown fluff that passes for romance nowadays. This adaptation gives new life to Austen's masterpiece.5/5 stars - the best version made to date	5.0	Undoubtedly the best adaptation of this book that I have ever seen	2011-02-16	1	0	1

Imagine watching a movie stretching for 6 hours! But having heard so much praise about it, I decided to see the movie for sometime. Once I started watching the movie, I didn't realize the time fly by, and saw myself putting one disc after another, watching the entire movie in a single sitting! After watching it, I decided that this is once of the best TV movies made ever.Nominated for 4 Emmy Awards (Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing for a Miniseries or a Special, Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design for a Miniseries or a Special (winner), Outstanding Miniseries and Outstanding Individual Achievement in Choreography), ""Pride and Prejudice"" revolves around relationships, betrayal, jealousy, and above all, a wonderful love story between two people. The relationship between Mr. Darcy and Eliza Bennett, Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley, Lydia Bennett and George Wickham, joined by Mrs. Bennett's wailing, Lydia and Kitty's childish pranks, the evil Caroline Bingley, and the snobbish Catherine de Bourgh kept me interested in the movie.The chemistry between Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is wonderful, keeping us interested in them for 6 hours. The rest of the cast were also wonderful, particularly Julia Sawalha (Lydia Bennett), Susannah Harker (Jane Bennett), Crispin Bonham-Carter (Charles Bingley), Adrian Lukis (George Wickham) and Alison Steadman (who played Mrs. Bennett). Simon Langton did a terrific job in directing this fantastic series (which I am sure is not easy, if you have to direct a movie that will keep the audience interested for such a long period). Of course, the major credit for the movie has to go the background score, and the costumes/sets for the movie. The people behind did a costume design did a wonderful job in giving the characters an elegant yet simple look, meshing well with the era timeline of the story.All in all, whether you are a Jane Austen fan or not, you should see this movie if you like watching romantic movies.

Mrs. Bennet's main motive in life is to marry off her five daughters, and as they haven't much of a dowry (the estate is entailed upon their cousin, Mr. Collins), she stoops to subterfuge (and often goes beyond the lines of propriety), all in the hopes of securing good husbands (and hopefully rich ones) for her daughters. When two rich & eligible bachelors (Mr. Bingley & Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth)) enter the neighborhood, it sparks a whirlwind of events in the lives of each of the Bennet girls. Add to this mix Mr. Bingley's snobbish sister, Miss Caroline Bingley, Elizabeth's best friend plain-jane Charlotte Lucas, Darcy's imperious aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourg & daughter Anne, the regiments' dastardly Mr. Wickham, and a few others, and you have an exciting tale of romance won and lost!The Review: once in awhile a film comes along that makes you sit up & take notice: this is one of those films.  A lavish mini-series, a joint effort by A&E; and BBC that originally aired in 1995 (in UK, 1996 in the USA), this remarkable adaptation is exceptional.  It has become not only the quintessential version of ""Pride & Prejudice,"" but also the quintessential period piece.  It sparked a world-wide craze for Colin Firth, Jane Austen adaptations & costume dramas, and led to a best-selling book ""Bridget Jones Diary,"" a movie version of the same, and a sequel!  P&P; was adapted for screen by the magnificently talented Andrew Davies (Vanity Fair, Emma, Wives & Daughters, Daniel Deronda, The Way We Live Now, etc.), the dialog is astounding, the costuming is gorgeous, the scenery is spectacular, and the acting is beyond compare!  Every single character plays their part to perfection: I cannot think of a thing I would change!For those of you worried about family-friendly content: there is little objectionable content in this mini-series.  There is a scene where an unmarried man & woman are seen living together in an apartment (they are shortly thereafter married); there is no language that I could find.  This series is very clean overall.I would certainly call this 5-hour mini-series the quintessential period piece of our age: it was incredibly well-adapted, and is touching & exquisite.  It ends as it should, very true to the spirit of Jane Austen: I would highly recommend this great series!"	5.0	Stunning adaptation: THE period piece of our age!	2005-11-28	5	5	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2JDG1XNDPU0UM	R. Bryant	Read the book in high school. While it's been done many times they never came close to following the book which was always disappointing. This one is the only one to follow the book as they took the time ( 6 episodes) to develop all the characters fully. They clearly spent the money to be true to the book. The many supporting actors ( at least 25) were all outstanding and perfect for their respective parts. Colin Firth and Jennifer Uhle were certainly outstanding but the supporting cast makes this movie.Add to that the outstanding music that was chosen and this is about as prefect a presentation that you can get. Since we bought this, we've probably re-watched it a dozens times- it's that enjoyable.	5.0	All Time Best of the Pride and Prejudice Movies	2013-12-08	2	2	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	APLOEU7Y6KAZ5	R. Earland	"I bought this video on the recommendation of a friend, and I will never be sorry for taking that advice. It was simply that good.At a run time of over five hours, I expected that there would be some slow spots, but there were none. From beginning to end, this film was completely engrossing. Nor does it suffer from once having been a televised mini-series. The breaks between episodes and between commercial interruptions are visible, but they are integrated masterfully into the continuous work.The screenplay is delightfully faithful to Austen. If there were any lines of dialogue omitted, I did not miss them. The characterisation is established early on, and is portrayed consistently throughout the film.The locations are perfect. Longbourne is stately, of course, but the contrast between it and the more luxurious estates, Netherfield Park, Pemberley, Rosings Park, is profound. The furniture and set-dressing, too, is appropriate for the time period and the affluence of the owner. The attention to detail is outstanding.The casting was inspired. Colin Firth, while he might not possess classic male beauty, simply radiates charisma. Jennifer Ehle is everything that Eliza Bennet, a ""local beauty"" could be expected to be, and possesses the animation to make the viewer believe that she is every bit the clever, independant woman she is supposed to be. Crispin Bonham-Carter as the amiable, handsome, and somewhat vapid Mr Bingley was also a good pick. Allison Steadman and Benjamin Whitrow were likewise well cast. There could have been no better choices for Caroline Bingley and Mr Collins than Anne Chancellor and David Bamber. Julia Sawalha might have been a bit old for the 15 year old Lydia Bennet, but her playful, unaffected manner make it easy to overlook that. Susannah Harker and Adrian Lukis were the only characters that did not fit, to my eye. Harker's acting saves her, as she does a wonderful job portraying the sweet-natured, serene-countenanced Jane Bennet, but neither is quite as handsome as they are reputed to be.The acting throughout was so good that I could not say who did the best job.The directing is where this really shines, though. The tendency with Austen is to have too heavy a hand. Austen is witty and funny, but she is subtle. Simon Langton could not have done a better job preserving everything that makes Jane Austen such a pleasure to read. He keeps the action moving forward, no mean feat over such a lengthy film, but allows Austen's own wit and humor to shine through.The soundtrack fits the piece perfectly. I especially enjoyed how Melvyn Tan's piano skills appeared to vary, depending on the performer actually sitting in front of the instrument. Music held a prominent place in the novel, and in the film, it almost had the place of another actor, rather than mere accompaniment. It was never a distraction, as it was in the 1986 BBC Northanger Abbey, nor did it overpower the scene, as it did in the 1995 BBC Persuasion. Instead, it subtly supported the action on the screen.The costumes, too were faithful and well done, but I did notice a few things that I might have wished were different. Jennifer Ehle does not have the right complexion for earth tones, and I felt that her beige frocks and tan spencers washed her out terribly. Also, Darcy is the only young man who wears dark trousers, besides Mr Collins, the clergyman. Every once in a while, he's put in a pair of buff or grey ones, but for the most part, they're all black. Most of the other male characters wear pale-colored trousers with formal attire. Yes, this really is all I found to complain about, which should say something."	5.0	Simply wonderful	2007-11-24	1	1	0

There are definitely parts from the other one that I prefer to this one (the scene where Darcy and Elizabeth confess they love each other--gaah! could they be stiffer?) but the depth of some of the characters is better in this one.  Darcy in particular is given more substance and motivation.  We see the progression of his feelings (we learn he actually HAS feelings) and actually feel sorry for him when he gets shot down.  Also, I heard Andrew Davies (the screenwriter) speak at a local university, and learned about all the little sexual innuendos he put into it.  Now when I see it, it's almost dirty.	4.0	It grows on you	2001-09-22	2	1	1

Then again I am a firm believer that all period films deserve 5 stars unless they are really quite poor. There could not have been a better actor picked for Darcy than Colin Firth.

Though before you see this film it is best that you read the book first because it fills in the parts that you may not understand or that the film has missed out, because let's face it 4 hours is quite long enough for a story. However I do like that it is broken down into the different parts because you can get a bit tired sitting there for that amount of time (thank God for the BBC turning it into a series).

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3Q8SS5OH52RAB	Renee Sereno	"I must admit I really loved the Keira Knightley movie, but I bought the miniseries after reading all the rave reviews saying it was superior to the film. And while I agree that the BBC production is more faithful to the book, this does not necessarily make the final product better.My main objection was to the casting of the miniseries. True, there were some characters which were played spot on: Charlotte and Mr. Collins, for example, and Mrs. Forster and Miss de Bourgh. Kitty and Mr. Bennett weren't too bad either. And although Matthew MacFayden's Darcy swept me off my feet, Colin Firth has put such a stamp on the character that it's hard to imagine him being anything but.Having said this, however, I still believe the casting left a lot to be desired. My main complaints:1) Mrs. Bennett was annoyingly shrill and over the top,2) Lydia was too coarse and unrefined (yes, even for Lydia),3) Mrs. Gardiner lacked authority. I couldn't imagine her character scolding Lydia for her indiscretion before the wedding.4) Mary was too unattractive. She even looked like she had chicken pox in some scenes. Weren't the Bennet girls supposed to be local beauties?5) Jennifer Ehle seemed to have the same facial expression throughout the series: a smug, supercilious, self-satisfied smirk, which looked pasted on like a Kabuki mask. This patent look rendered her Lizzie a bit too self-assured that it was a stretch of the imagination to believe she was, as she claimed to Lady Catherine der Bourgh, ""not one-and-twenty"".But these to me were mere annoyances compared to the biggest casting mistake of all: Jane, who was as plain a Jane as you could get. Was British television running low on English Roses when they cast this production? I'm sure they could have found someone prettier than Susannah Harker. Honestly, the girl who played Miss King, whom the sisters dismissed as ""plain"" and ""freckled"" was a lot prettier, as was Jennifer Ehle, who played Lizzie. (I thought Rosamund Pike as Jane in the 2005 movie was a bit of casting genius. Keira Knightley is pretty, like Lizzie, but Rosamund Pike is beautiful, as Jane should rightfully be.)Therefore, scenes like the one where Lizzie told (Plain) Jane she was ""five times prettier"" than any of the sisters, and (Plain) Jane just simpered without even acknowledging the compliment were downright laughable. Succeeding allusions to her supposed ""beauty"", such as Darcy's ""You were dancing with the only handsome girl in the room"" and Bingley's ""She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld"" were a constant source of irritation, as Susannah Harker, though pleasant enough, was thoroughly undeserving of such rapturous praise.I mean, honestly, was I the only one who thought so? I only wish I hadn't seen the movie ""A Knight's Tale"" first, because Harker looks just like Allan Tudyk (the guy who played Wat) in drag, and I couldn't get the disturbing image of Jane snarling ""Pain! Pain"" out of my mind.The final verdict? I wish I would've just borrowed this DVD set, as I don't think I'll be watching it again. The film is shorter and much more romantic. As for being true to the book, neither production is, so I think I'll just read the original."	3.0	a disappointment after all the hype; could've  been better cast	2007-07-08	14	7	7

Boasting the lavish production values that one has come to associate with the BBC, steady direction from Simon Langon and a great ensemble cast, ""Pride And Prejudice"" offers great entertainment over five hours.I usually watch TV series on DVD by the episode, but this series was so rivetting, I made by way through it in two sittings, taking in three episodes at a time. And not once did the narrative drag, as the Bennet sisters made their way through life, meeting and romancing the men of their dreams.Much has been made about the leading stars Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle being too old for the characters as depicted in Austen's literary classic. Well, I haven't read the great book but let me tell you, they were perfect for the roles in this series - totally believable and capable of holding the audience's attention.The story is essentially about how the antagonism between Darcy, a wealthy and aloof single man, and Elizabeth Bennet, whom he slights at their first meeting at a country dance, changes into love.Equally good were Susannah Harker as the eldest Bennett sibling Jane, Alison Steadman as the whiney and irritating mother of the clan, David Bamber as the slimy Mr Collins and Benjamin Whitrow, who especially shines as solid-as-a-rock Mr Bennet.Of equal note are the magnificent mansions that feature throughout the series and their stunning surroundings, and the gorgeous costumes that perfectly capture the feel of Regency England.This series, which premiered on BBC in 1995, has been remastered for the DVD release and comes with glorious colour and in widescreen. The video is quiet good but there are some compression artefacts from over five hours of content being squeezed on to two discs.The soundtrack is plain vanilla stereo but benefits from being decoded with the Dolby Prologic II setting on modern home theatre receivers, as this allows Carl Davis' piano-driven score to shine. The dialogue, which is what really matters in a production like this, comes through clearly and without any distortions.As for this being a ""special edition""....well, it really isn't. All you get is a 25-minute making of featurette that has the director, screenwriter and some other members of the crew talking about how they transformed the book into a workable script and chose the cast and locations. There isn't any contribution from Jennifer Ehle or Colin Firth and the featurette doesn't offer any new insights."	4.0	A great way to spend 5 hours, but a special edition this isn't	2005-10-14	7	7	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A18DNGGEN65T3O	R. Holmes	This so-called Special Edition DVD was a great disappointment.  The contrast is way off and the colors completely washed out.  There was also a disturbing tendency for the image to wobble when the camera angle changed.  A much-rented tape copy that I had seen was better in quality than this.  Anyone seeking a good copy in full screen is now out of luck, since all the VHS and the previous DVD are full-screen presentations.  The direction and performances are as wonderful as any you might expect to see.  This is a great screen version of the story (High praise if you love the Greer Garson/Laurence Olivier version as much as I do), but not worth seeing in this re-production.  One can only hope that the cinematographer never has to see what they have done to his beautiful work.	1.0	Pride &amp; Prejudice (Not So) Special Edition DVD	2001-10-12	9	6	3

I have the Kiera Nightly version of &#34;Pride & Prejudice&#34; (2:05) and admittedly I don't like Kiera but I don't like movie at all. Sometimes in this version, It's hard to tell if Colin Firth is acting or just standing there. BUT, I'd rather spend the 5 hours watching this version as it is almost a word for word rendition of the novel than anything else. Jennifer Ehle captivates and does a masterful job of bringing Lizzy Bennett to life. The only fact on which the series falls down on is Jane Bennett. She is supposed to be much prettier than Lizzy and this actress is either the best thing the Brits could come up with or another example of sick British humour, as she is plane, plain, Plain.

Kooi	I have just recently realized how much I love Colin Firth as an actor (I don't know how he escaped me so long!), so I have been on a search for all of his films.  I struck gold with this one!  I loved this miniseries!  The chemistry of the entire cast was fantastic, and the day flew by!  Like others, I couldn't pull myself away until I watched every episode.  I found the blue ray version locally for close to $50, but I was able to order it for barely more than $20...great deal!  The picture was a bit grainy at times, but it didn't take anything away from the film.  I haven't watched all the extras yet, but so far I have enjoyed the ones I have seen.  I would highly recommend this film to any Jane Austin (or Colin Firth) fans!	5.0	Great for the price!	2011-02-02	1	1	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1OVF0KSZZRTEV	R. L. Cobleigh	I consider Jane Austen's novel the consummate masterpiece of classic fiction, so the plot and characters are of the highest ilk. As to this production of the story, it's by far the best. All of the actors are excellent; the 5+ hours go by without your noticing, and when you finish watching it, you cannot help but want to start over again, because you can't bear to leave the world that it has created. Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy gives a performance that on first watching seems stiff and restrained. Once you've seen it two or three times, however, :) you start to notice just how much is going on in that multi-layered portrayal, and it's stunning. Jennifer Ehle is the perfect Elizabeth Bennett, and her skill and dignity and beauty make this entire production a pleasure to watch. I can't drool enough about this movie...I've talked as many of my friends as possible into marathon viewing sessions, and they have, without fail, really enjoyed it. This ain't a chick-flick, either: I was most surprised to learn of male aquaintances who thought it was great.	5.0	Wish I could rate it 10 stars	2002-11-27	9	9	0

Sometimes the quality of the Blu-ray is horrible, light colors and facial tomes seem to be swimming in gray pixels.  This is especially evident in scenes of candlelight or half-light in rooms.  It looks to me like they over-sharpened a great deal of the film, but I have no idea how Blu-rays are produced and what they had to work with in the original.

My wife and I had worn out the tapes we made when the series first aired on A&E;, and have since burned through the subsequent VHS official release, and most recently have been enjoying it on the first DVD release.(...)the color/tint/brightness are all washed out. There is too much contrast in the color, bringing the lights and darks to extremes. The hue of the color is also waashed out, a little too bleak to enjoy Ms. Bennett's rosy cheeks or Mr. D'Arcy's walk from the pond...The widescreen aspect is great; it does add a bit of grandeur to the scenes, but the freaky color has us put off.

As an illustration:I first showed this production to my older parents and my teen aged daughter (and friend) starting at 9:00 p.m. one summer vacation evening. At 1:00 a.m. we had only seen 3/5 of the film and I suggested we wait until the next day to finish. ""NOOO!!"" arose from everyone, even my father (who loves to sleep). We finished by 3:00 a.m. After sleeping for ~6 hours, still morning, I came downstairs to check on my daughter and her friend; they had already begun what would be their second of three viewings over the next 24 hours!What makes this product distinctive is the BEAUTIFULLY REALIZED TRANSFER TO HIGH DEFINITION. The quality of the PREVIOUS DVD has been NOTORIOUSLY BAD (washed out colors & a look as if a worn-out tape was used as the source). If the production weren't so wonderful it could have been a tragic product altogether. With this transfer ORIGINAL COLOR AND QUALITY IS RESTORED! Honestly, I first saw this on VHS in standard definition, so this is actually the most beautiful I've seen this landmark production.The DVD extras are excellent, with a fascinating series of interviews with original cast and production personnel relating the excitement and controversy surrounding the project. I could only have been happier if Jennifer Ehle were included; she was apparently unavailable to the documentarians. I would also have enjoyed a commentary track with the director/writer and/or actors.I have stopped buying DVDs and BDs for the most part in this digital age where everything is becoming available over broadband, ""on-demand,"" and physical reproductions aren't necessary.

In 2005 I foolishly bought the 10th Anniversary Edition as the cover art-work suggested that the problems with the original transfer had been corrected. Upon viewing it, I wrote to the head of BBC in Australia with the challenge that if she could find any of the colours on the packaging actually on the DVD, I would happily walk naked down a Melbourne street at peak hour. Luckily for the locals, none could be found, and the offending item was returned. Now I am delighted to say that the original warmth has been lovingly restored in the Blu-Ray edition. Yes, as previous reviewers have stated, it was not shot in HD, nor even in 35mm - just humble 16mm, and at times some of the long-shots are not entirely distinct - yet it is a small quibble, and this is well worth the purchase to be able to once again see this iconic series in the rich tapestry of colours in which it was originally made.

The graphics have a wider range of depth and are just amazingly clear.The Story - Wonderful, the acting just as good as it has always been.Now for the problem, or what I see as a HUGE problem. The story is broken into chapters complete with opening credits and ending credits that are not there in the Extended DVD version I own as well. So rather then putting the first on in and watching a complete unbroken story, there are these breaks, where you have to fast forward through sections. The end of the starting credits is not even at a break point so you can just `skip' ahead through it. This is extremely annoying to me. Other wise, it's great!	4.0	Blu-ray Review of Pride and Prejudice	2009-09-12	4	4	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2KTBO6ZE31H36	R. pierce	This review is for the blu-ray DVD itself, not the movie.  I have the original release on regular DVD.  It is one of my favorites, so I thought I'd upgrade to the blu-ray.  When I first watched it (I have a large 55&#34; TV), I thought I had purchased a pirated copy.  The picture was really grainy; the people sparkled, just like those guys in Twilight that stayed out in the sun too long.  After reading some of the reviews on this one, I realize my copy is not an illegal one, just bad.  (I bought it from EBAY, but it was sealed and had a security thingy).  The color is better than the original, and, since I was using headphones, I didn't notice much difference on the sound.  I was able to tweak the picture on my big screen and it did improve a bit, but it certainly can't compare to my other blu-rays.Also, for a &#34;keepsake&#34; edition, I can't believe they have about 5 movie previews on BOTH of the DVD's, which, by the way, are crystal clear, which should have given me my first clue.  Also, they run the credits after each episode, which you have to scroll through.  Also a disappointment.  My original DVD just plays straight through.  If I had enough brains to purchase this through Amazon, I may have tried to return it, but you know how ebay is.  And, after my tweaks, it's not horrible, just not what I expected.	2.0	Grainy	2014-04-01	1	1	0

However, I assume they all come from the same warehouses, so I'm posting my comment here.  My version is missing the vital scene describing Mr. Wickham's dealings with Darcy's sister!  I love this show, and have watched it many many times, and I can tell you that this was NOT the scene to edit out!  I also concur with others about the poor quality of the color and sound.  Interestingly, the featurette at the end has the original excellent color and sound.  Quite a contrast to the rest of the DVD!

This is a classic movie that should be in every Jane Austins collection.  If you have the newer verison of pride and prejudice with keira knightly and are asking yourself if you should get this, GET IT!!!The characters are charming.  No one can play Mr Darcy quite like Colin Firth, such a proud actor in this film.  The only one flaw in this movie is that i didnt enjoy Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth, although she is a very good actress.  All the sisters where quite charming except for the one who played Lydia Bennett.  It could be how the character played in the movie.Just a wonderful wonderful made movie!

Looking at George Wickham, who is supposed to be about Darcy's age (about 28 year-old in the book. But in the movie, the actor looked like he was in his 40s. Not mention Caroline Bingley looking like in her late 30s. Even the leading actress, in my opinion, looked too mature to play the supposed 20,21 year-old Elizabeth Bennet. Could it be that there was simply a lack of excellent young British actors?BTW, the picture quality looked bad.	3.0	disappointed, Indeed!	2006-04-29	31	8	23

This Blu-Ray version is outstanding in terms of the digital quality of the picture and sound.  That alone makes it worth having the Blu-Ray edition if you already have the DVD version.  For example, when compared with the DVD version of this film, I noticed the brilliancy of the colors of the actor's costumes more vividly.  The extras that are included on this film that describes its casting, production, etc... is also included on this Blu-Ray edition.

I still do. Andrew Davies made it his own alright, adding bits that just were not in the Jane Austen original, most obviously, the silly swim in the lake. He attempted to bring sex into the story for a modern audience, when it was all about attraction and growing love, and I am convinced miss Austen would have been horrified at all the heaving bosoms. Modesty and the fliratious use of fans, a language in its own right, were the order of the day in Regency England. Fancy dressing came into its own in the ballrooms where the aforementioned heavings would have been acceptible,  and the Bennet family were middle class, not wealthy, hence the snobbery by the Bingley sisters and Mr. Darcy.So, the costumes were gorgeous, the actors good looking at the locations sumptuous, but the dialogue...they just did not speak like that in Regency times. It was all dumbed down for the masses and I was very disappointed with the whole production. I kept hoping it would get better. The only master stroke was the lovely double wedding at the end, but even that wasn't in the original classic. Love it if you must, but I prefer the 1980 BBC version, which stuck to the original and was a better production all round.	2.0	How can you update a classic?	2006-10-29	18	11	7

Instead of butchering the novel as many tv series have done, A &amp; E remains  faithful to the plot and writing, and the result is ready wit and dialogue  that entertains and stimulates the mind. I have seen this movie multiple  times and have yet to tire of it. The characters are superbly portrayed,  and the male and female leads, including Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle,  lend a brilliance and energy to the screen that reaffirms our faith in true  love and the union of minds as well as bodies in marriage.

He was prideful and conceited, & terribly arrogant early on.  It is why Liizzy so easily believed Wickham's lies.  Other versions of this great book downplay this aspect of Darcy and concentrate on Lizzy.  It is the interaction, how both felt and believed about the other that makes this version so outstanding.  I loved the small details, such as how Darcy and Mr. Bennet care for their coat tails but the newer monied Mr. Bingley sits on them.  In the final scene, the difference in their incomes show up.  Darcy with a nicer carriage and 4 horses; Bingley slightly smaller and 2 horses.  My only complaint, a very small one, was seeing the credits after every segment.  I also wished that in the 2nd proposal scene I could have seen both faces on the screen at once.  This version gave a very clear picture of Every character and I loved that.

How their relationship builds over the course of the story is never boring - the ups and downs, combined with the accomanying subplot storylines, keep my interest time and time again.

James ""teacher/writer"""	This version of Pride and Prejudice will never be eclipsed by any other. This is a strong statement to make, but I stand behind it. A couple of remakes and recontextualized versions are either out or in the works, but unless any of them are six hours long, they will not be able to do Austen's novel justice. This is the film for those who love Jane Austen's book just as it is. Due to the film's length, little had to be cut from the story. The period elements are well-done. Colin Firth is the best Darcy I have seen. (Don't even get me started on Laurence Olivier and that horrible black and white travesty that claimed to be P&P.;) The writers, producers, and all involved in this film obviously had a great respect for Austen and kept the tone of her work in this film. It is well-acted, funny, visually enjoyable, and never feels long to me, though it is five hours. I wish filmmakers would not try to remake this one; no other film version can top this.One reviewer commented on the DVD color not looking right -- I found that mine seems extra bright in color to me. It's not bad -- it just didn't seem as bright to me when I saw this on tv or video. It also seemed to make a difference whether I was playing it in my computer or on a regular DVD player.

The scenes are gorgeus and you learn so much about every character that you feel you live in their time! Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy is wonderful! His early silence draws to him and his love for Elizabeth Bennet is so passionate and honest. Jennifer Ehle is every bit of Elizabeth Bennet as I imagined as I read the book. She is a superd actress and is full of personality. THe costumes of beautiful and so are the scenes of Pemberley. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are both so easy to look at on screen. They are becuatiful together and are a pleasure to watch. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite novel of all times, and I love the video so much! I have had it for 5 years now and I watch it every month still! I love this story and I always have dreamed of being Elizabeth Bennet and falling in love with the rich and hansom Mr. Darcy. The supporting cast is amazing too! Mrs. Bennet is funny and extravagant, and Mr. Bingley is a pleasure to watch. The Passion and excitement never go away in this movie, Though it is almost 6 hours long, The time just flies by. There is not one slow part in the whole movie.  This videois a great thing to watch before or after you had read Jane Austens novel Pride and Prejudice, and I'm sure after seeing this you'll want to read much more of Jane Austen's novels.I cannot describe to you how wonderful this movie is.

He portrayed Mr. Darcy excellently and this version has to be my favorite but I also enjoyed the Keira Knightly version and truly loved that Mr. Darcy as well.  If I had to tell anyone interested, I'd definetly say watch this version first and then turn to Keira Knightly's version.  The 1980s version is a good one too but Mr. Darcy is just not interesting enough in that one.  He comes across as a snob at the end of the movie too when he should not be.  His character just didn't fit in the movie.  I would also suggest trying the very old Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson version but be aware that it is very hollywood style of that year.  Very sugary and spicy and corny.  ""Briget Jones's Diary""  is another great version more moderized but yet again Colin Firth performs as ""Mr. Darcy"".  It is just as much fun as the Original stories and worth anyone's time."	5.0	Love for romance...	2010-12-10	3	2	1

The movie took a couple of liberties here and there (such as the scenes with Lydia and wickham), but mostly just to add to the movie - it did nothing to take away from it. Until watching this, the only version I had seen was the recent one with Keira Knightley. While I thought that one was decent enough, I felt they changed too much of it. That being said however, I much preferred Keira Knightley's performance of Elizabeth Bennet - it just felt more passionate to me, Jennifer Ehle was too subdued in my opinion - she just didn't have that same spark as the original character in the book and didn't draw me in as much. I realize it's all a matter of character interpretation and personal taste as to which actress you'd prefer - that's just my opinion. Also, while I love Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, and I think he was a great casting choice, there were certain parts in the end that he could have been softer, and less stern - again though, that's just my interpretaion of the character. Overall, this A&E version is excellent, I thought they did a great job casting the male roles and thought they had a much better casting for Lydia Bennet than in the new movie version. This version is certainly less ""flashy"" I guess you'd say, than the movie, but I much prefer this version for its faithfulness to the story. I didn't have any problems wiith color or sound either."	4.0	Love the movie with slight exceptions	2008-07-03	3	3	0

While I agree with other reviewers that sometimes the sound quality in particular is not great (don't try to run the sound through your home theatre sound system-the volume has to go so high to hear the dialogue that the music will blast you from your chair)I personally don't care that much because of all the great things about the movie-Colin Firth, to name one!What I like best here-besides the terrific casting (I particularly enjoyed Julia Sawalha, Absolutely Fabulous' stuffy Saffy, flouncing about and flirting outrageously) is that it manages to keep you in suspense, just as the book does, even after repeated readings and viewings.  Intellectually we know that Elizabeth will get her Mr. Darcy, but we still wait with bated breath for the final proposal.Add that to breathtaking scenery, witty dialogue, and characters who leap from the screen, and you have one lovely afternoon's viewing, even if it didn't include a wet-shirted Colin (which it gratifyingly does.)I can watch this one over and over and never get tired of it.	5.0	Pure delight	2003-01-07	5	5	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A24SURAO7EFNN5	"S. Greer ""patience"""	Worst production of Pride and Prejudice ever. The screenplay was obviously written by a man, and one who did not comprehend the source material. Sexed up for American TV, it loses all the charm of the manners and morals play of the novel. Almost a pastiche, all the characters are caricatures. Eahles face pulling and continuous eyebrow raising are a distraction from the story as well as her overblown sighing and bosom heaving. Don't bother with this version of the movie. Reread the novel or go for the '70s version with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul.	1.0	Heaving Bosoms	2010-06-04	36	1	35

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1IMNNBC4ME0NB	ShamayimBlue	This adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is well-made and has an exceptional cast.  Each actor fit wonderfully with the assigned role, and even though some of the performances got a little too over the top at times (I'm referring to Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins), they still elicited a lot of chuckles.  The most inspired casting choice was Colin Firth as Darcy.  I think this is the best he's ever looked in any movie, and no one does smoldering hauteur better than he does; it gets to be that one eagerly awaits the moment when he'll next appear on the screen.There are some minor points that detracted from the movie.  The film was made to be presented on television in installments.  If one watches it all at once, rather than spaced out over time, one notices some repetitive scenes and passages of dialogue (placed in the movie not only to remain faithful to the book, but to jog the television viewer's memory over what happened in the last installment).  Also, there are some ludicrous moments where floating heads appear in mirrors or carriage windows, and again, these disembodied talking heads usually pop up to remind the viewer of something that happened earlier in the movie.  Also - and this bothered me most - I wish more of the dialogue revolved around matters that weren't strictly plot-related.  In the book there are certain comments and conversations that are omitted from the movie that I think would have fleshed out the characters more.Other than that, the BBC's Pride and Prejudice is a joy to watch.  Not only are the actors fantastic, the movie is filmed in a very picturesque way and you will love looking at the period costumes.  And Firth...  Colin Firth's presence prompts one to purchase the DVD.	4.0	Great adaptation of classic novel	2004-07-25	5	3	2

Nobody could ever top Firth, he is the perfect personification of Darcy, he prefectly shows the arrogance, that covers a deep insecurity, you fall for him as Elizabeth does.  I thought the casting in general was perfect, the women that plays Lady Catherine is fantastic, as is the lady that plays Elizabeth's social climbing mother, she nails the part.  I enjoyed watching the new Keira Knightly version and it was fun rating that films characters against the ones in this version and though the new version is very good, frankly this version is the benchmark.

This version is pretty good and I liked it, but after it was over I felt a bit let down.PRO:* Jennifer Ehle gave a lovely performance.* The script was fairly true to the book (though too much of a good thing can be a liability - see below)* There were some lovely moments between Darcy and Elizabeth early on and midway through where their growing love is so evident. I especially enjoyed the scene at Pemberley when Elizabeth and Darcy meet unexpectedly.  So charming!CON:* The cinematography and direction were completely uninspired.  I could have forgiven boring visuals (even though this is a visual medium...) but,* The director didn't add his own special thought or point of view to the story.  He took the easy way out and made it literal - TOO literal, in my opinion.  Many times, the story felt flat, cold and unfailingly polite - but not REAL.  This is a movie, not a book and not everything in the novel translates well onto the screen.* The movie started off nice, but ended with a fizzle, almost as if the director had gotten bored and just wanted to hurry up and get it over with.* The 2nd proposal had to be one of the most underplayed, disappointing scenes in cinematic history.  It's a simple scene in the novel, as well, but simple doesn't mean boring!  So much could have been done to convey the emotion of the event (when you read the novel, the passion is unmistakable), but in this film it was just a boring, little exchange.  I almost missed the fact that it WAS the proposal. It was *that* bad.  I blame the director.Despite it's flaws, I still believe it is well worth watching, but it's certainly not the Greatest P&P; adaptation ever.	3.0	Good, but  not Great	2007-10-25	6	2	4

Colin Firth is absolutely perfect in the role of Mr. Darcy.  Jennifer Ehle is equally superb.  The series is so well done it is like stepping into the book.HOWEVER:The quality of the DVD is INCREDIBLY BAD!  The picture quality is so poor that if you watch too closely it will strain your eyes.  The sound!  OMG!!!!  It is SO bad!!!!  The background music and sounds are so loud you can barely make out the dialogue.  There is no provision for subtitles--if there were, I would use it and mute the horrible sound so that I could at least follow the story.  I love this series so much for the story and the acting that I endure the exceptionally bad quality of the DVD just to watch it; and I know it is not this certain DVD, but the way it was produced.  SO SO DISAPPOINTING!!  There is nothing &#34;special&#34; about this Special Edition.I can only hope that someone will take on the project of digitally remastering this wonderful production so that true followers of Jane Austin and her wonderful tale may be able to enjoy it in all it's splendor on DVD.If you decide to purchase this series for the shear desire of experiencing Colin Firth in all his glory, please be warned:  You will have to work to enjoy it in spite of the horrible, irritating sound quality and poor video picture.BEWARE!!!	2.0	Quality of DVD Worst EVER	2013-05-10	1	1	0

It's long so save time for a movie marathon, but it's worth every penny. The Amazon price is really good too, compared to purchasing it at a specialty movie store. This one, in my humble opinion, is SO MUCH BETTER than the more recent Pride and Prejudice version with Keira Knightley (no offense - the acting is good, but the storyline has way too much cut out to make it shorter for the boxoffice). And my favorite part of the movie - Colin Firth. Can't get enough of staring at him! lol. Great movie - you won't regret it.

This adaptation is the closest I have ever seen to capturing the true feeling of the book. All other Pride and Prejudice movies do not even come close, especially the latest version from a few years ago. Terrible! Although a bit long, the series was necessary to give true detail to this memorable tale. The images are beautiful, the characters are flawless. Mrs. Bennett is just as I would imagine her, Mr. Bennett is wonderful as well. Darcy (Colin Firth) is the best and most handsome Darcy and does the character justice. Elizabeth (Jennifer Ehle) is beautiful and a great actress.  The only character who is a little off is Jane. I thought she should be more beautiful than Elizabeth, but her deameanor is correct.

I can't say enough praise of Pride and Prejudice. The characters, the actors, the story is all so well done. For any woman who is a true romantic at heart she'll love this one. If you've read the book then you won't be disappointed by the movie. BBC has done an outstanding job at reproducing the story. I love to hate Mr. Darcy and then to fall in love with him along with Elizabeth as she sees him for who he really is. The escapades of the younger sister Lydia show how foolish some young girls can be. The charming and dashing Mr. Bingley creates the desire to find such a man who is so amiable and fun. And the riduculous mother with all her ailments makes me laugh. I would recommend this to everyone who is a true romantic.

Colin Firth is magical in the role of Mr. Darcy. The casting on this project was so excellently done, the interpretations of the characters by each of the actors has to be one of the most outstanding I have ever seen. Bingly's sisters are perfectly snobby. Elizabeth's mother is perfectly hystrionic. Lydia is perfectly shallow and silly. Mary is perfectly prudish. Jane is perfectly good. Bingly is perfectly foppish, yet with an air of manliness - not often seen in this role. Mr. Darcy is perfectly proud with a strong sense of integrity that, together with his overall subtle machismo, is absolutely irresistable. Elizabeth's beauty is tolerable, I suppose - just kidding. She is perfectly lovely and strong. Even the minor character castings are amazingly perfect: Mr. Collins, Charlotte, Mr. & Mrs. Gardner, Wickham - perfect. Why Hollywood tried to remake Pride & Prejudice after A&E's timelessly perfect production is beyond me. Hollywood's latest version's casting is off, the characters underdeveloped and the screenplay embellishments completely miss Jane Austen's romantic subtlety based in context of its period. I think the A&E version should be re-released as a feature film with an intermission.	5.0	So Excellently Done	2006-06-30	7	6	1

One would wonder in what cave have I dwelt!  But because of my fortunate happenstance, I am now enamored with all of Jane Austen's novels and I have never seen so perfect an adaptation as presented by Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth!  I could almost read from the book itself, since the script was kept so very close to the original!  I have watched it four times at least since receiving it less than a fortnight ago.  My husband was attentive through it all (and he is NOT a reader of 'old novels')!  Yet, he exclaimed that he would be most happy to see it all again - in one sitting!  Please suffer me to overuse exclamation points as I bubble forth with praise from the finest of acting and casting regarding all the characters, from Elizabeth's forthrightness, Lydia's lack of remorse, Lady Catherine de Bourgh's indignation (from the start) and to even Mr. Collins' perpetual loquacity! One scene touched me particularly, the look on Darcy's face as he beheld Miss Bennet and his sister at the pianoforte.  His countenance was filled with such exquisite delight, yet obviously controlled in such a manner that one could feel his shear joy at finally being in the company of the two most beloved people on the planet! I say that I am most 'prejudiced' in casting my ballot for this version as the most beautiful and most satisfying rendition of Austen's classic that I have ever seen.  Actually, I know not any screenplay of any novel so well done as this one notwhithstanding Gone With the Wind.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	ANK76360Q8YU2	shortandsweet	"Before giving this review such a title, I waited and waited for the new Keira Knightly ""Pride & Prejudice"" to come out in the theatres.  You can see my review of that on its page.But in all honesty, I can now say that this is the best Pride & Prejudice I have seen.  It holds as true to the book as cinematically possible.  The acting is spot-on.  It's obvious that each actor took the time and really got to know their characters inside and out, adding little nuances that were incredibly interesting to watch.I don't understand what the people who are saying it's bad picture quality are seeing.  I haven't had any problems with my DVD and my television.  It looks incredibly rich and full.  I really was impressed.In short, this is an amazing version of the classic Jane Austen novel that will leave men and women alike interested in further reading (and watching) Jane Austen.  It had that affect on my husband and I!"	5.0	Best book to movie adaptation of Jane Austen yet!	2005-12-26	8	7	1

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AURACYZMBVHGK	SianaS	There are some things I enjoyed about this version but there are others that I found to be unfortunate. Colin Firth makes a believable Mr. Darcy, perhaps a bit more emotional than Austen's character but still endearing. Jennifer Ehle as Lizzie has the playfulness described by the author but she constantly appears to be more mature than her supposed age with a perpetual knowing look that doesn't necessarily jive with her description.I absolutely hated Mrs. Bennett's portrayal in this version....she just screeches through the entire series. Lydia appears to be mentally impaired half the time and Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine are shown as caricatures. The Bingley sisters appear overly stuffy  without the subtle conniving needling they employ in the book.All in all not a bad adaptation but not a great one either.	3.0	Not great	2013-11-17	3	2	1

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1XEFHQZP8Y35W	Silver Screen	This A&E; production is absolutely flawless, from the casting, to the locations, to the costuming, to the dances.  Each actor embodies the element of their character, from Colin Firth's superb portrayal of Mr. Darcy's aloofness, to Jennifer Ehle's spunky adaption of Elizabeth's wit and vivaciousness.  Although each and every actor is perfectly suited to their character, Alison Steadman as Mrs. Bennet is an absolute riot!  She steals nearly every scene she is in - - not an easy task when working with such a stellar group of performers.Having roughly five hours to tell the tale allows this production the advantage that it's 1940s counterpart did not - - the buildup of the romance between Darcy and Elizabeth, the foundation of the characters, their daily activities and the importance of the dance.Repeated viewings do not dull my enthusiasm for this wonderful miniseries.Highly recommend this one!!	5.0	Absolute Perfection!	2006-02-20	2	2	0

I liked the Kiera Knightly one, but it left out a lot to fit story into a theater length movie. Having said that I like having this on dvd so can I watch it in parts due to the length. I think the acting is fantastic, I can understand what's being said and the subtle nuances behind the words spoken.  The actors did a great job in conveying emotions and treating the words of this classic story so carefully.  Music, costuming, scenery, were great too.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A33OHGCE0V9MFU	Sizzlingtree	I have to say right off the bat that I am prejudiced towards this DVD and thank the BBC/A&E home videos for bringing out such an amazing adaptation of the classic Pride and Prejudice. If you havent already watched the DVD then do so RIGHT NOW, especially if you are into historical stuff! I did not read the book before watching this mini-movie(I had read an abridged version in school many,many years back) and I feel that not reading the book does not in any way make the movie less understandable and enjoyable. I would in fact recommend that one watch the movie first and then read the book. That is what I did! The person who said that it is impossible to not watch all 6 hours in one go is correct. You have to sit down and watch the whole series so get set with some good food and drinks as well as a nice comfy blanket. Personally the second part/DVD is my favourite because that is when things really begin to change for Lizzy and Jane and how all the pieces begin to fit together. You are missing out on something if you havent watched this DVD.	5.0	Pride and Prejudice	2004-09-27	4	3	1

And I can well understand why. I, too, was captivated by P&amp;P from the first time it aired. I knew Jane Austen, had even kind of read some of her works. Since then, I have become a dyed-in-the-wool fan of hers.What can I say? Almost everyone has raved on about the wonderful qualities of the movie, and they're absolutely right! The casting, setting, costumes, character portrayals, etc. is all divine. Highest compliments to everyone involved. As soon as I could, I bought both the VHS set and the soundtrack. Let it be said, I'm infamous in my family for this movie. I've quite literally seen it hundreds of times (wore out my first copy, working on the second, will soon need a third) and will continue to do so! It's quite possible you'll sit down, watch the entire thing, then go back to the beginning and start again. So, schedule some free time, sit back, and enjoy a truly dazzing production!PS. My personal favorite is episode #4 (in the tapes, don't know about the DVD) beginning with Darcy's letter explaining his behavior regarding Wickham, right through to Darcy and Lizzie's surprise meeting, &quot;Mr. Darcy!&quot;	5.0	my favorite	2002-03-13	5	5	0

It appears to be the same as the much-lauded British version, with its longer main feature playing time and reportedly better video. It even has a ""Made in England"" sticker on it! It has the 5.1 DTS-HD soundtrack and runs, according to the label, approximately 327 minutes. Special features include the HD Restoration Piece but not the cast interviews or walkabout. I'd much rather trade some ""special features"" for more ""main feature""!I'm not sure why it was re-released in 2009 in an apparently inferior format. I say ""reportedly"" and ""apparently"" because I have not viewed the 2009 release but have read several reviews on the Web comparing the two. There were still a few of the 2008 version left on Amazon last time I checked, but the price has shot up. It may also be available elsewhere on the Web. I think it is probably worth hunting for!

You can always trust BBC in excellence in costume drama, both the 1975 and this version are the most authentic adoptation I've seen.What I particularly liked about this production is that unlike the 1975 production, the '96 Mr. Darcy is no longer just Elizabeth's beau - but a character with substance, commending its own place in the story.......and to the skeptical men readin this review, I AM preferring to the famous Colin-Firth-walks-out-of-the-lake scene..............Before Elizabeth's visit to Pemberly, Mr. Darcy was just one of her suitors, created to give Austin a chance to show off Elizabeth's quick wit and acid tonge.  Pemberly is the real entrance for Mr. Darcy.  From here on, the author began to concentrate on him, giving him life, voice and presence.So what's wrong with emphasising this grand entrance by making a bit of splash?!  ^_^	4.0	Finally, a production that makes Darcy 3D	2008-09-06	3	2	1

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2PK8KUNEW5KUF	S. MARTYNIUK	Once in a while life rewards us unexpectedly and I decided to write this review in gratitude of such surprises. It starts with my daughter, aged 16, innocently recommending the book 'Pride and Prejudice' to me because she had recently read it at school.Before reading the book I was prompted to visit Amazon and I noticed that there had been the BBC period-drama in 1996 which I hadn't seen. Following the link I found the many hearty endorsements which you are now reading, and - considerably enthused by the chorus of praise - I decided that it would be preferable to watch the movie first.Well, I thought, this could be pretty good; I set my expectations fairly high. But nothing, nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to happen. A five-hour high-speed emotionally-moving insight-bringing experience which started off like a bomb and just got better and better and better as each hour progressed. It left me gasping for breath at how such a feat could be achieved.It has been noted by many of the reviewers that they stayed up till 4am. I was the same; it would have been quite impossible to have left it unfinished. The humour was glorious, and having read just a little of the book, I can see Ms. Austen's hand in this; her wit is perfect (witty on page one of the book!) and it is astonishing to discover that she is still hilarious now, 200 years later. For example... the obsequious Mr Collins! What a hoot! And I will add, well done actor David Bamber. Austen's other strengths are also unmissable: the power of insight into human nature. Elizabeth and Darcy. I am a sucker for shedding a tear at movies and I make no apology, I'm sure many of you will have experienced the same in the good cause of true love revealed.The cinematography, the scenery, the production, the direction, the humour, the music, the sheer attention to detail; all these things contribute to this considerable accomplishment, but of course it has not escaped the attention of this reviewer that it is the acting which carries it.Racking my brain for a criticism, I found one: The movie is at least six hours too short. I didn't want it to end.	5.0	Praise and More Praise	2002-02-05	8	8	0

I hadn't read Pride and Prejudice prior to seeing the movie, but when I finally did get around to reading the book, I couldn't believe how accurate this movie was to what was in the book. In my opinion, that very rarely happens and it's great that they were able to recreate the book perfectly into a movie! In addition to the recreation, the acting, setting, costumes, and everything else I felt was just great. A&E and BBC did a great job at capturing everything perfectly. Every time I watch this movie, I hate that it has to end. I have yet to see any other versions of Pride and Prejudice, so I have no other versions to compare this one to, but I am sure that none of the others would do this version or the book justice	5.0	Really Great!	2008-08-22	3	2	1

I understood that only certain cast members were going to be interviewed in the ""extra"" DVD special features.  Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle are not among them.  I was hoping though that it would have been a more behind the scenes documentary.  It wasn't.  What you get are about 5 cast members sitting in chairs talking about the movie, and many of the things that they say are already included in the booklet that comes with this set.  So the special features do not offer anything new or different.  I also found the commentary by Adrian Lukas (Mr. Wickam) to be vulgar and tasteless.  His testimony was an ode to being excessively drunk, and it ended up sounding like the boasting of a college frat boy.  I found such comments to be completely out of line with the Pride and Prejudice film.  This film was the best edition of Pride and Prejudice ever made - unfortunately, this set does not match the quality of the film contained in it.  Mind you, if you don't already own it, and you like the look of the green box and the booklet that comes with it, which is very informative and interesting, then this set would be enjoyable.

It is one of the finest pieces of literature in the Englishlanguage.  I especially enjoy the development of the characters, themasterful orchestration of the plot, and the subtle wit and humorthroughout the novel.  It's an absolute masterpiece.  There is no waythat a movie of reasonable length (a few hours) could provide the samedepth that a novel could.That said, I still enjoy owning this version of P&P.;  I also have theKeira Knightley version of P&P; and enjoy that too, although I would pickthe A&E;/BBC version of the two if I were forced to.  You should realizethat the A&E; version is 5 hours compared to the 2 hours of the Knightleyversion.Because of the 5 hour running time, the A&E; version uses more of thebook's dialog.  To me, that, by definition, makes it more ""realistic""and faithful to the book.  You'll also need to get used to the mannerof speaking, which is a bit different from current English.My only downcheck for the A&E; DVD is the lack of subtitles, which I needbecause of my poor hearing.  But it isn't enough of a problem to causeme not to rate this offering 5 stars.It's a classic story of boy meets girl and how they eventually fall inlove, surmounting the obstacles of their pride and prejudices.  All thefilm's romantic tension is relieved near the end during the walk totown.  One of my favorite shots of the movie is the wonder and relief onDarcy's face when he learns that Elizabeth loves him.  I suspect all ofus can identify with the joy he feels, as learning that the person youlove returns your love has to be one of the greatest emotions we humanscan experience.Guys:  this is not just a ""chick flick"".  It's quality entertainment andyou'll want to pay attention to the dialog, for there lies the subtlehumor in the movie.I also think the casting for the characters of Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Collinswas perfect.  The most fabulous bit of acting was done by the actressplaying Mrs. Bennett.Finally -- once you've seen one or more movie versions, read the book.  Youwon't be disappointed.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1MUP3BTU5XSAL	Spider Wood	"There is a passionate following for this series.  You may read that this series brought Jane Austen into the 21st century.  This series inspired the ""Bridget Jones"" movies.  However, I have to agree with reviewers who say that the two are a certain kind of animal, and they're different from Jane Austen's book.The 1980 BBC adaptation is more faithful to the book by Jane Austen than the others, both in character and plot.  It's also more comical and lighthearted than the other versions, but that's because it doesn't present any character as a cartoon or caricature (e.g., compare Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins here to their 1995 miniseries counterparts).  A caricature, to me, is like a lump of lead: throw it in water and it sinks.I find the relationships between the characters develop naturally.  The plain settings allow this development to come forth, like really good theatre.  Our reward is that we see the characters interacting in a world that has particular conventions.  Some of these conventions are difficult to explain to today's audiences, who get off on movies...like ""Titanic.""  Certainly, Fay Weldon crafted a couple of new scenes and there are some minor logical errors, but she's kept the dialogue, aired it out with discretion without twisting it.  Today's audiences tend to expect actors to show a good deal of emotion.  I think that Darcy's ""stiffness,"" as portrayed by David Rintoul, is right on key.  It's a function both of his pride and social standing, and makes for positive change as the series progresses.Elizabeth Garvie is very beautiful to look at as Elizabeth, but what sets her above other actresses in the role is her intelligence and curiosity about the world.  Her eyes are beautiful because they are open.  She is prejudiced against Darcy because he sleights her, he has contrived to separate Jane from Bingley, and is dislikeable, not because, for example, she is smugly superior to a likeable man.  Her discoveries of what a scoundrel Wickham is, and of Darcy's actions on behalf of her sister's honor, lead her (and the audience) to change judgment.Today's audiences tend to dislike her narration (but the book was originally narrated, no?) and to impose a modern standard of sex appeal.  (However, if there's a woman out there likeGarvie's Elizabeth, I'd certainly like to meet her...before I'm 35.)The other actors get into the meat of their parts, but I'll only recognize a few here.  Barbara Shelley is a warm and attractive Aunt Gardiner, the aunt you wish you had to warn you against evil.  Moray Watson is Mr. Bennet, a man of intelligence who suffers a wife-become-frivolous, and has a close bond with Elizabeth, despite being hemmed in by silly daughters.  Judy Parfitt is a pompous and caustic Lady de Bourgh ripe for shaking by Elizabeth at the end.  Sabina Franklyn (Jane) is beautiful and straightforward: though acquaintances of mine find her not voluptuous enough, I don't think that's a problem.The actress who plays Charlotte Lucas is plain, but not at all unhandsome and emphasizes the practicality of the character.The thing about pre-circa-1985 BBC dramas is you can watch them and imagine grand settings around the basic integrity of the characters and plot, without having so many bucks and pounds poured in for eye candy, or to do the work of the imagination.  And that's what reading the book is about anyway, coming up with one's own pictures.The 1995 series has strengths as entertainment.  Consider, however, that Jane Austen may have written a story for characters that are different from the ones that you see.  If you've already decided you prefer the 1995 series to the 1980 series, I probably won't convince you that the 1980 one is better.  Go ahead, clear your head of television, and let the book be your guide!"	3.0	Go ahead ... read the book!	2005-01-05	13	5	8

I was somewhat relieved to find out that I am not the only person to have watched this  series multiple times!  I have owned the tapes for some years now: after  having seen (and taped) the series on television when it first aired, I  decided that only actually owning the original tapes would do (I'm glad I  did, as there are some extra scenes contained therein).  I have never been  the type of person to watch any movie more than once, but this is the  exception!  I have watched this countless times, practically memorized the  dialogue, I'm embarrassed to admit, and never grow tired of it!

The colors are more vivid, the people look life-like, the settings and scenery are gorgeous -- in short, everything looks unbelievably beautiful. My words cannot do justice to the clarity, the sharpness, the sheer beauty of it all. I fell in love with Elizabeth and Darcy all over again.If you have a Blu-ray player, and love P & P, I would definitely recommend purchasing this version of the mini-series.	5.0	Unbelievably Beautiful	2009-09-12	2	2	0

After reading Jane Austen's book, I was entralled and enamored and desperate to get more of what has become my favorite story. I found satisfaction in this movie.  It is, simply put, the best adaption of a book to the screen that I have ever seen (due in no small part to its being adapted by A&E rather than hollywood).  The casting was excellent, (I love Colin Firth and think he must gain admirers with each viewer) and the acting superb.  The scenery and costumes were so authentic and the six hours seemed too short. One small fact that discontented me was the ending.  while it was good, it seemed a bit rushed after the time taken with the rest of the story and it left me wanting.  Even so, I've still given this movie 5 stars (and would have given more) so obviously the ending did not decrease the value of the movie by much. If you loved Jane Austen's magnificant novel, you ow it to yourself to watch this movie.  it will truly take you back to regency england and make you wish to stay.	5.0	The most wonderful movie I have ever seen!!	2001-05-23	1	1	0

Smith ""Sassy"""	I found this version of Pride and Prejudice infinitely better than those I have seen in the past.  I read the book after I watched the movie and was glad I did.  The only thing I would criticize is the development of the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth.  It was slow and lagged behind the details in the book.  I was not sure of their feelings for each other throughout and because of that the ending was a complete surprise.  It felt as if it was cliffhanger; I was left completely unsatisfied by the ending.  At the last scene I was still not sure what they felt for each other.  There are parts left out of the movie that were integral in the book.  Though I realize that every part of the book could not possibly find its way in this adaptation.  It is evident that much was left on the cutting room floor.  I agree with one of the reviewer that Jennifer Ehle's smirk in the movie was in the words of the characters at times tiresome.  I still would recommend this DVD to anyone who is a fan of these types of stories and Jane Austen.	4.0	A wonderful adaptation	2003-09-04	6	3	3

I own two copies of the miniseries and I continue to watch the 6 hour length film nearly everyday. Of all of the film adaptations of Jane Austen's books I believe that this is the only one that relays Ms. Austen's true lessons and observations of character. The performances by Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are astounding, to say the least. Their tremendous performances transport the viewer into the world of Jane Austen. If you aren't interested in the plot then watch it for its exquisite set design and costuming. If you desire to see the most remarkable, intelligent actors battling a war of the wits, then this movie is for you. If you love the subject of relationships and true love then you absolutely must watch this film. Lastly, if you are an Actor or other stage performer or musician then you absolutely must view this film at least once. For all of the reasons above, this film is good for almost all audiences. I highly recommend it and I hope that you view this film and purchase it. If you own one film then let it be this one.

What I liked most about the features was the still photography that was included. You really can see in great detail how beautiful the actors and costumes were! Also included are features from a previous edition (2005ish) that were also quite nice to see. The downside of the extra features are that Firth and Elhe aren't in them, but there is a lot of really interesting stuff in there. The &#34;film&#34; itself looks absolutely beautiful compared to my dvd. I found myself noticing things I have never before...like a costume &#34;malfunction&#34; with Lydia (see her bra type undergarment), jewelry, fabrics, stuff in the background. I was a little annoyed that it is set up in the original 6 episodes...so 6 opening credits and closing credits. Also I was a little annoyed that the first disk only has 4 episodes and the last two and the features are on the 2nd disk.

All that was included were a couple written biographies and one featurette that was sadly lacking in any kind of interesting stories from on set, details about the actual production, or interviews with more of the great cast members.

That said, DVD should easily carry studio-quality video, and this DVD is nowhere near that. It is gritty, squirmy, and unsharp.

Unfortunately, the DVD is a bit of a disappointment. The color transfer is a washout -- all you have to do is watch the version that appears on broadcast and this DVD. It's sad, frankly. The DVD should look better than broadcast, and while sharp, the color problems are evident.You get used to it, at any rate, and can still enjoy the miniseries.

I have seen different versions of Pride and Prejudice and I have liked all of them for different reasons.When I say that it is better than I expected it's because I have become eskeptical over things that are praised too much. I tend to not like them as much as reviewers or critics or even friends rave over them. This however is in my opinion, very good.I recomend it to everyone who likes the book,works by Jane Austen , other versions of Pride and Prejudice and of course who likes Colin Firth (pretty good performance).	4.0	Better than I expected.	2007-05-16	2	2	0

Sorry,but Greer Garson cannot retrieve the situation.2) The 1980 version *ing Elisabeth Garvie and David Rintoul  -more true to the dialogue written by J.Austen herself .Garvie was beautiful and better,especially in voice modulation in sarcasm(you should hear her say ):-a)""You are mistaken,Mr. Darcy,if you suppose the ""mode"" of your ""Declaration"" ........"" (the sarcasm in the words MODE and DECLARATION have to be heard and savoured.)b)"" Mr Darcy has no defect,he owns it himself,without disguise !""I think she has(had) a far greater vocal range than J.Ehle,particularly in expressing sarcasm.David Rintoul (to me) is the quintessential Darcy,ramrod stiff,tall and silent -the transformation is all the greater in the later part when ""his manners are `softened'""!The scene of the re meeting is so different -Darcy is preceded by his dog,which E.Benett notices(to her shock).3) The A&E; version : is a visual treat (despite the loss in transfer)Music:- Simply love the brief pieces when (a) a wet Darcy is striding towards his house,only to bump into a startled Elisabeth  b) at his house with E on the piano and the long look that passes between them. c) The piano piece by Louisa Hurst at the Netherfield Ball (in anger) at the ""pushiness"" of the Bennetts.Ms Ehle gives a splendid performance and is superior to Garvie in subtle facial changes ,even the break(s) in her voice sounds so natural.Truly a brilliant performance -but alas,they have removed some of the critical scenes (dialogue) -I would have loved to hear Ms Ehle say """" Mr Darcy has no defect,he owns it himself,without disguise !""  It's a pity one does not have enough material of this wonderful actress (reflects the ""popular"" tastes of our time,alas )! Plastic Baywatch babes seem to be the only worthwhile females,alas ! Colin Firth seems to be a universal favorite of the ladies,and I have ""no strong objections to the gentleman"" -I only wish that for a silent character that Darcy is,they had not omitted the few dialogues in the novel,and replaced them with excessively long dance sequences etc -but this may be because I am a male beast....After all the interludes between Darcy and E Benett (to me)are the main thing.....anyway,I have the book ! (was it really so essential to show Darcy going around shady areas searching for Wickham/Lydia Benett ? ) Mercifully.most of Mr. Benett `s stuff is preserved.Mrs Benett has been overdone.Lydia was enacted superbly as was Bingley,both Mr and Ms.I am NOT ashamed to say that I have seen this film at least thrice(just recd my DVD) in the last month,despite being male,and a techie to boot ! I confess I am SICK of watching movies of laser guided ""precision"" bombs killing women and children,in every poverty stricken hellhole on earth.My manners have been ""softened"" not by a woman,but by the sheer perverseness of the world today !For modern ""Darcies"" rejected by today's Elizas(Baywatch babes),a poem from 17th century England,by Sir John Suckling's advice (addressed not to a jilted woman,but to a spurned man):-Why so pale and wan,fond lover ?  Prithee why so pale ?Will,when looking well can't move her, looking ill prevail ?""Quit,quit for shame!...This cannot take her,If,of herself,she will not love,Nothing can make her,The devil take her!"""	4.0	Excellent,but for missing dialogue	2004-08-10	15	12	3

I've always thought English film and TV productions are far superior to our productions and this just proves my point.The acting, scenery and everything on screen is a treat for the eyes and ears.Colin Firth is wonderful as the broodingly handsome Mr. Darcy. His arrogance and charm come through and he develops all through the movie. It's wonderful to watch.Jennifer Ehle is a beautiful and independant Elizabeth who give him a taste of his own medicine.The cast is truly outstanding. Elizabeths family is typical of the times and her father is a bit of a weak man who has just  given up and accepts what life has given him. The mother is a twit who hasn't a thing between her ears but air. Jane is a good older sister but a bit colorless. Lydia is perfectly acted and comes across just as she's supposed to. Poor Mr. Wickham. As bad as he's portrayed, you almost feel sorry for him, being stuck with that flighty Lydia for the rest of his life. The other sisters are rather non-descript but add to the story in their own way.Mr. Darcy is dark and brooding. He is also in his own way kind and generous. This comes out later as his charactor developes into a most wonderful person.This is definitely one of the finest productions by A&amp;E. Jane Austen would be proud.	5.0	Oh that Mr. Darcy.	2002-06-15	20	12	8

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2EJJPILNT78FX	S. Webb	We are huge fans of A&E's Pride and Prejudice starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.  We were excited by the prospect of a 10th anniversary edition of the film, expecially the interviews and retrospectives promised by this edition.  The DVD special interviews were very disappointing and primarily feature the actors playing Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Mary Bennet and Mr. Wickham.  While their interviews were interesting, the main characters are conspicuously absent.  I will likely sell my copy on eBay and wait for a more in-depth special edition that has video interviews with all the cast--especially the main characters.  Also, the behind the scenes clips are very limited.  While the booklet is okay, it would have been nice if the producers had invested more time and attention to this edition's special features.  If they had, I would have been willing to pay double for it!	2.0	Pass on this one.	2006-12-15	14	11	3

Several scenes, not in the book, provide very interesting ""background"" for the condition of Mr. Darcy during which time he is absent from Bennett scenes of action.Anyone who sees this movie would be advised to get the publication, ""The Making of Pride and Prejudice"", which tells how the film was made, scenes and settings found (with map of southwest England), costumes designed, and includes comments from actors.  There are hilarious characterizations here (Lady Catherine de Bourgh; Mr. Collins; Mrs. Bennett), a romantic story (or two), all excellently done.  Mr. Hurst has practically no spoken lines, but his expressive physical presence in several scenes provides sight enough to make his character ""speak"", especially the scene in which only his satin-breeched form lies sleeping in the center.

I was immediately charmed by the series, and couldn't stop watching it.Despite the series' excellence, its original DVD release was not without its shortcomings.  The compression was one of the lousiest I've ever seen (we have a dvd player with a VERY small buffer, which will not play high-bitrate DVDs; this DVD played on it with no problem, the bitrate was so low!).  There was a noticable lack of extras, and the menu itself was spartan, to say the least.The Special Edition remedies just about all of these problems.  Not only has the picture been remastered, but it is also presented in ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN (Now there's something I didn't expect) The sound has also been remastered, and sounds beautiful, crisp and full.  For extras, you get &quot;The Making of Pride and Prejudice&quot;, which is a decent little documentary.  I would have preferred a few less scenes taken straight from the final print of the movie, and more off-takes and off-screen happenings.  But it works.  The only other extra you get is the biographies/bibliographies/filmographies, which are not very comprehensive.  The menu is still somewhat minimal.Even if you don't like period dramas, I can't reccomend this series enough.  If you already own the previous DVD set or even the VHS set, you won't regret having bought this Special Edition.  A great presentation of a great film.	5.0	A well-deserved Special Edition	2002-04-14	11	10	1

I have seen many others, but I have to vote with the crowd. This is a stunning adaptation. The length gives it depth that you won't see in other versions. You really get a sense of the initial dislike from both characters and then their changing emotions. The interplay with the other characters also fleshes them out in ways that help you to understand foreign and antiquated ways. The visuals are are a perfect backdrop. They are so well done that you don't notice them, but you get the full effect of the fabrics and textures, the nature scenes, the variations in decorations and room size, as well as the feel of the different towns. The pacing is also perfect. It never drags or leaves you feeling like you missed something. I watched the whole thing in 2 sittings. It was mesmerizing.	5.0	The BEST P&P version	2012-10-04	2	2	0

This film transports you into another time and place where pride about the family fortune or prejudice about the inferiority of one's connections could keep people well suited to one another apart.  Fantastic casting and direction truly make the characters come to life!  Everyone from Darcy, Bingley, and Wickam to the entire Bennet family shines and comes to life.

Only one thing disappointed me however .... I don't care for the way the discs are stored in the set.  They are slid inbetween a cardboard envelope and it took alot of skill for me to get them out without feeling like I was scratching them up against the cardboard.  I much rather prefer when the discs are easily snapped into a case as I feel they are better protected.

My sister recently introduced this mini-series to me (she owns the dvd) and at first, I was skeptical. I am not a huge fan of period movies. She begged me to watch it with her, so I told her I'd sit down and watch it with the hidden agenda of getting up about 15 minutes into it and making an excuse to leave.That never happened. I was completely captivated in the first scene. After the first half of the movie was done, I was the one begging her to put the second dvd in to watch the rest of this truly amazing movie.Where do I begin, and what can I say that all the other reviews have not already said, and some so eloquently! I have never before seen a movie where the casting of the characters was so superior! Hats off to the casting directors! Hollywood should take note!It was as if the actors and actresses were born to play these roles. The music, sets, scenes...extraordinary. Jennifer Ehle who played Elizabeth was outstanding, and of course Colin Firth, I don't think there was a bad review about him (and I read about 25-30 reviews). He simply IS Mr. Darcy..dare he play another role!!Alison Steadman as Mrs. Bennet is a riot and that role is hers and hers alone...her character's insistent quest to marry off her five daughters, regardless of the potential suitor's character, is just such a joy to watch!Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Lady Catherine de Bourgh was also born into her role. What an outstanding actress, as they ALL were.As I said before, I have never seen a movie where every character is absolutely PERFECT for the role that they play.So, here it is, from someone who doesn't watch many movies like this. I am now a Pride and Prejudice junky. Bought the dvd and have already watched the movie 3 times and it still is not enough.I want a sequel. I want to see Elizabeth's and Darcy's children. I want to see how Elizabeth handles being the mistress of that huge castle. I want to see how she handles future dealings with Lady Catherine de Bourgh......essentially, I want to grow up and old with these people!!

I don't think I'll ever be able to watch this on regular DVD ever again. The digitally remastered, HD gorgeousness that is this film is just eye-opening in so many ways. My mom and I spent the entire time just commenting on all the intricate details of the clothing and the setting that we had totally missed before.As for the actual film itself - in my humble opinion, this is the superior rendition of one of Jane Austen's most beloved stories. The acting is superior, the characters and story are more fleshed out, it's more ""accurate"" to the period detail wise than the newest version... it's easily one of the best book-to-film adaptions I've ever seen.

There were complaints about the images being too washed out, etc.  But, luckily, I bought it anyway.  I had never seen Pride and Prejudice before.  I had only caught parts of it when it was airing on A&E;, and I never was able to see the very beginning, so I didn't want to watch it in the middle.When my DVD arrived, I popped it in and sat down for 6 hours and watched the entire thing.  I just loved it!!!  I didn't notice any problems with the color on this edition. Some of the scenes are shot in direct sunlight, which may make the characters' faces seemed washed out to some people, but it didn't bother me at all.There aren't a lot of extras on the DVD, but the movie is so great, you don't really need much.  The Behind-the-Scenes featurette is good.  I remember an interview with the actress who played Mrs. Bennett.  They were talking about the first table reading of the script with the actors. At first, no one was really getting into their characters, but then the actress that played Mrs. Bennett started reading her lines just as she imagined her character would say them, and everyone else caught on and really started getting into their parts.I would recommend this edition of the DVD to everyone.

The ciminotgraphy (sp?) was the best.  Although the movie is very long, it is a complex story and the time must be spent to do it justice.  The nuances of the British caste system are not easily related to the American audience and care must be taken so that each one is understood.The characters are very developed and much care has been taken with each one.  Mr. Bennett is not unlike any father of 5 girls (with no sons) and Mrs. Bennett is a sight-her character is well played by the actress.  Elizabeth is a classic beauty, handsome is the term the film uses, and is well played by the actress as well. The remainder of the characters, especially Colin Firth, play their characters to a tee.The actress that plays Ms. Bingly was the funniest however.  She was perfectly cast as the sister of a man whose friend she would like to marry.  The comments and looks were so funny, and a great example that not much has changed since Ms. Austin wrote the book - females can be as petty as the day is long!	5.0	Great Flick	2006-03-17	8	7	1

I've watched it more than once in the same day. A little extreme, I suppose, but I do love it that much.

Elizabeth Bennett (Jennifer Ehle) is a strong-willed, sensible young woman whose father is a gentleman with a modest estate, but the family suffers in status because of an uncle who works as a businessman in Cheapside.  She has four sisters and a mother eager to marry them to wealthy young gentlemen.  Elizabeth meets such a man -- Fitzwilliam Darcy (Colin Firth) -- at a local ball, but he is arrogant and rude and there is instant mutual distaste.Colin Firth ranks as one of the better screen Darcys, a group that includes Laurence Olivier.  Jennifer Ehle is very good as Elizabeth Bennett.  There is very little action here, so the story tends to bog down frequently and the concerns of the characters can wear thin.  But the production is lavish, with outdoor scenes and period costumes often stealing the spotlight, and a cast of accomplished British actors give the mini-series the proper authenticity.  There are several bonus extras in this two-disc Blu-ray edition, including a making-of featurette and a look at the adaptation from novel to screen."	5.0	Faithful Adaptation, Excellent Cast, Wonderful Scenic and Costume Design	2009-04-26	3	1	2

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2VUD4SPJO4V33	Theo	This is far and away the best Pride & Prejudice adaptation I have ever seen for either the big or small screen. Everything about it is just spot on. By good chance I happened to read the novel only a few months before this series was first released, and I have always felt this adaptation captured the spirit of the original perfectly. Much of the dialogue is lifted verbatim from the book; and they couldn't have made a better choice. For me at least, Austin's greatest strength has always been the sheer beauty of her language.I'd also add that this really is one of those things you want to own rather than rent. Personally I've seen it right through from beginning to end more than a dozen times: first on TV, then on VHS, and now on DVD. And this is coming from A GUY, okay? A GUY. One who actually likes women, too. Honest to God.Yes, it really is that good.The only qualifier I will insert is that I'm writing all this about the series generally. I am uncertain whether this edition matches perfectly to what I have on my disks at home.But then, the best piece of advice I could give you about Amazon reviews is never blithely assume that what you're reading applies to the product seen before you. I have seen a number of my own reviews crop up for versions or editions other than the one I originally wrote them for. For that reason, when I do have something particularly strong to say about the merits of a particular version, nowadays I'm always careful to place a product link inside the review itself so that everyone can be sure exactly what I'm talking about; as I did for example in my review ofForbidden Planet (Two-Disc Special Edition).Yes, that's the way my tastes usually run. I admit it: I'm a sci-fi buff! I also like anime. But this series is so good that it transcends such minor sectarian squabbles. In fact, I can honestly say I've never known anyone who saw it and didn't love it.BUY IT. If you've got anything inside you at all, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.Theo.	5.0	The best P&P adaptation for either big or small screen	2010-09-30	3	3	0

Jane Austen was a simple yet wonderful writer.  Beautiful love story.  I fell in love with Colin Firth watching this version of the movie/ story.  He was so convincing (as Mr. Darcy) when showing his love for Elizabeth ! He was truly the hero ! Like the prince in fairly tales.  What a man ! The other actors in the movie were also ""Top-Notch"", and delivered marvelous performances.  It was an all around very enjoyable story.  (However, one needs to watch it a few times - without discussing with other people in the room - because one must be careful to really LISTEN to all of what the characters are saying - as the dialogue can be difficult to understand at first (Old English).  But once you get the hang of it - it can be quite pleasant to listen to, and it CAN be understood. (This was the FIRST movie of its 'type' I ever viewed - so the 'language' did take a little getting used to.) But its not a problem any longer.  Yes, I have discussed this movie with many a person and would continue to recommend it to all I discuss it with.  I think they should show this (and other similar movies from the time period) to students of English Literature in the school systems - it wouldn't hurt to get a little 'culture' in these youngsters, you know."	5.0	Pride And Prejudice	2013-04-20	0	0	0

It follows the original text as closely as can be expected, allowing for a few necessary changes to make the story work as a screenplay.  In fact, it is so similar to the book that you could almost follow along, which is certainly rare.  Jennifer Ehle gives an excellent portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett, and Colin Firth's performance as Mr. Darcy is exceptional.  True fans of Jane Austen's writing will not be disappointed!I have previously seen this miniseries on VHS and DVD; I can say that this Blu-Ray version is definitely of superior quality.

This ""Colin Firth"" version is much more truer to the text; therefore taking six hours, instead of two. My only complaint is the casting. Jane is supposedly the prettiest of the Bennett girls.

Jennifer Ehle's (Elizabeth Bennet) and Colin Firth (Mr Darcy)'s performances were absolutely stellar--neither one seems particularly to need words in order to convey any number of emotions. Alison Steadman is utterly out-of-this world, capturing the so-embarrassing-it-hurts-you-to-watch-it-even-as-you-laugh qualities of Mrs Bennet perfectly, and her performance is very well complimented by that of Benjamin Whitrow (Mr Bennet).  Jane is perfectly serene, the younger sisters are fantastic, Miss Bingley wonderfully snooty, Mr Bingley unbelievably well-mannered in the face of much provocation.  David Bamber as Mr Collins couldn't have been more perfectly cast.  Truly, this production is absolutely first-rate.	5.0	The best adaptation yet.	2006-01-14	5	4	1
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A278FM2WAUBK4G	Thunderofsilence	This was a the best version of Pride and Prejudice I have ever seen. I see that this movie really lauched Colin Firth's career. To me, he will always be Mr. Darcy; for there is no other, really. This version was very light-hearted, fun, and funny. The cinematography was lush, the acting great, the actors portrayed their characters remarkably. In the later version with Keira Knightly, Mr. Darcy was too young, Donald Sutherland, an American, who played Mr. Bennett was too apathetic, and didn't have the closeness to Lizzie as did the 1996 A&E version with Colin Firth. Brenda Blevin was a tired, old-looking mother. She didn't displayed the funny and silliness of the mother in 1996 version. But worst of all was the part of Lydia, the youngest sister, who was played by Jenna Malone, an American, who was not the least bit interesting. This lastest version should never have been made as far as I'm concerned.	5.0	The Best Version of Pride and Prejudice I have ever Seen	2011-01-09	5	1	4

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2Z13QAST1E7Q9	"Tiggah ""the Anglophile"""	"Of all the dramatisations of classic novels of British literature that I have seen, none have so completely captured a novel's essence or been so perfectly cast as has this rendition of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  It is simply outstanding--a beautiful treatment of a splendidly witty, humorous and insightful novel.For those unfamiliar with the novel, it is certainly not necessary to read it in order to fully appreciate the dramatisation (although it is a novel that I highly recommend).  Briefly, the story concerns Miss Elizabeth Bennet (Jennifer Ehle), a spirited, quick-witted and intelligent (not to mention beautiful) young woman from a family of modest means, and the wealthy Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth), a handsome but very reserved and indeed proud young man.  Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth albeit against his will (for he deems her to be socially inferior and cannot abide her silly mother and sisters).  Elizabeth (who displays a quickness to judge others based on appearances and ""first impressions""), however, does not care for the arrogant, haughty Mr. Darcy, whose real fault lies in letting his pride show.  It is the tension between these two main characters that comprises the central story and gives it its spark.  I won't say any more, for I don't wish to give the story away for those unfamiliar with it.  Suffice it to say that although it takes place some 200 years ago, it is every bit as relevant today as it was then, for although customs have changed and technologies have advanced, human nature remains the same.For those familiar with the novel, liberties have necessarily been taken in bringing the novel to screen in order to create an interesting and enjoyable visual experience, but they are not intrusive, obvious liberties (ie. one must root through the novel in order to find them), and the story remains admirably close to the original.  Most important of all, it is absolutely spot on in capturing the essence and themes of the novel (which, I might add is no mean feat!).As for the cast, they are all absolutely superb at capturing the essence of their respective characters--from Julia Sawalha's giddy and vivacious portrayal of the boy-crazy and impetuous Lydia Bennet (Elizabeth's younger sister) to David Bamber's hilarious portrayal of the grovelling, sycophantic toady Mr. Collins (Elizabeth's cousin upon whom the family's house is entailed) to Alison Steadman's humorously shrill and highly strung Mrs. Bennet (Elizabeth's eternally pessimistic mother).  Of course, one simply cannot forget the splendid portrayal by Jennifer Ehle, who captures Lizzy's spirit and wit to perfection.  Last but certainly not least is Colin Firth, who will forever be etched in many a mind (and heart) as the quintessential Mr. Darcy.This set consists of six 50-minute episodes, and it is a story of timeless appeal which I highly, highly recommend.  Although it will certainly be of interest to fans of period drama (for it is without a doubt one of the best of all time), I believe its scope is broad enough to be enjoyed by anyone looking for a great story that's superbly acted.  This is truly a beautiful, classic story that the whole family can enjoy.  It really is a dramatisation that comes along once in a lifetime and one to be treasured.  It is a joy to curl up and watch it time and time again, and I simply cannot praise it highly enough.For those who have enjoyed the dramatisation, I highly recommend the superb companion book entitled ""The Making of Pride and Prejudice."""	5.0	The All-Time Best Mini-Series Ever Produced!	2002-09-25	11	11	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AXVUFQXT9YK4R	Tom Meyer	As someone who has just enjoyed a Pride and Prejudice binge (in this last month I have re-watched the Elizabeth Garvie version, watched this production for the first time, and just finished the book last night), I  find this production very good, but falling short of the fabulous reviews  that it has gotten on this site.  But, to be fair, I'll begin by singing  its praises.  This production does accurately capture the feel of the book,  and the liberties it has taken are all reasonable, and generally add to the  film.  The locations are beautiful, and the large budget was put to very  good use.  Jennifer Ehle is quite good as Lizzy, and Colin Firth really is  spectacular as Darcy (if I were a girl I'm sure that I'd have as big a  crush on him as so many of the following reviewers seem to have).  Firth  plays all of Darcy's nuances and subtleties phenonimally.  This film also  has the best renditions of Lydia and Wickham, and whomever plays them are  perfect.  But, as I said, this version is far from perfect.  The first  thing that struck me was how badly the Bennet girls were cast by physical  appearance.  Susannah Hawker is very attractive, but is simply not the  stunner that Jane is supposed to be. Jennifer Ehle, though very good  looking, has amazingly squinty eyes, which is unfortunate for an actress  playing character whose only noted characteristic are her &quot;fine  eyes.&quot;  (Then again, no one will EVER be able to live up to Elizabeth  Garvie as Lizzy: Garvie had it just perfect and - saying this a an  eighteen-year-old college-freshman guy - she is ten times more attractive!  Her beautiful - and may I add, OPEN - eyes cause me to simply melt.  I must  confess to a having a slight crush on her.)  And, even more startling on  the subject of physical casting is the actress cast as Charlotte Lucas -  she's not plain at all!  Though I admit that this is at some level  unimportant, it does rather jump out at you.  Other characters are badly  cast (in other senses - not just physical): Bingly looks amiable but  vacant, Mr. Bennet is not quite funny enough, and Mr. Collins seems almost  sinister at times!  Changing subjects, one would think that a five-to-six  hour version of P&amp;P would be able to use all of the wonderful dialogue  in the book, but some how, many of the great lines are lost or horribly  butchered.  The DVD is also featureless, and having the opening and closing  credits every hour is unbelievably irritating.  Over all, though, I do  recommend seeing this production, and on the whole it is quite good.  However, please watch the Elizabeth Garvie version if you have not: the  sets might be wretched, but it is much more faithful to the script, Mr.  Collins, Bennet and Bingly are much better, as is Mrs. Bennet, and  Elizabeth Garvie just shines.	4.0	Very good, but certainly not &quot;perfect&quot;	2000-01-11	11	7	4

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2A0ZT12G34QB1	Toomuchtimeonmyhands	I own the Greer Garson-Laurence Olivier version, the earlier BBC version, and this version of Pride and Prejudice. And while I like all three, this version is by far the best because of the great chemistry between Colin Firth's Darcy and Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth. Ehle's Elizabeth does have a dash more sass than the literary Elizabeth, but that sass is needed to take on the imposing and indignant portayal of Firth's Darcy. And the result is wonderful-you can cut the sensual tension between the two with a knife and you really get why Darcy, such naturally prideful person, falls so hard for her. He has obviously met his match! The best scene in the whole movie is when Elizabeth covers for Darcy's sister when she gets flustered over the mentioning of Wickam, and Darcy and Elizabeth just stare at eachother with longing and respect for eachother.  I think the addition of this scene was great because it conveys the fact that Darcy understands what a one in a million gal Elizabeth is while Elizabeth realizes all the responsibility that Darcy shouldered all these years and that's why he's a little anal retentive and stiff. Great, great adaption of a great, great book!	5.0	Good chemistry between the two main characters	2004-10-26	12	11	1

Quach	Alright, I already wrote a review asking people to refrain from criticizing the dvd features of this &quot;special edition&quot; because, at the time, the only version available was a not-so-great, out of print edition with absolutely NO special features whatsoever(heck, the original version even lacked basic features like closed captioning and seamless episodes).  I finally received the Special Edition dvd yesterday and reviewed it excitedly.  It is, after all, the best movie ever made. :-) Anyhow, maybe it was all the anticipation.  Maybe I had set my hopes too high...or maybe this new special edition just plain sucked.  I don't know.  Let's just say I'm not impressed.  On the contrary, I'm pretty disappointed.But let's not start out negatively.  Let me first say that some things are improved for this edition.  First, there is closed captioning, which is great for those of us who want to know every word of this movie.  Second, the episodes are seamless, which is a nice change from the original.  Third, there is a behind the scenes &quot;making of&quot; featurette that is pretty interesting (but where neither Firth or Ehle are interviewed).  Fourth, it's the widescreen version.  And that's about it.  There's some biographies or whatever, but for the most part, that's all the &quot;special&quot; you're going to get.  No director commentaries, no cast interviews with the major stars, nothin'.As for the picture quality, I can't quite put my finger on it, but I actually find myself disappointed by it.  The picture, although much crisper, was paler than the original version.  Everyone looked so pale.  I found myself readjusting my tv quite a bit.  Often times, Elizabeth seemed to blend into the background the coloring was that bad.  The original version had much warmer tones, which I enjoyed.  Everyone looks so sickly in this new version.In balancing, if I could only have one version, I'd probably stick to the first one.  The coloring on this special edition is really awful.  Of course, when all is said and done, this is still my favorite movie of all time and, I think, one that everybody should own, despite it's flaws.  That's why four stars--five stars for the content of this movie, but (-1) for its flawed presentation.	4.0	The much anticipated &quot;Special Edition&quot;...not so special...	2001-09-28	19	17	2

Colin Firth was the PERFECT Darcy, I can't imagine anyone better for the role!I have watched this miniseries about once a month for the past year, and I can't imagine I'll ever get tired of it!  In fact, the story itself is so engaging that even my husband (who hates what he calls ""tally-ho"" movies) will sit and watch it with me almost every time!  If you buy it, you won't be disappointed!"	5.0	Excellent Adaptation of the Book!	2002-07-17	1	1	0

This Blu-ray version gives the option on the menu of the disc itself.  Of course, you can leave them off if you prefer.  However, my household really needed English subtitles because one member is hard of hearing.  My hearing is near perfect but I like a ""back up"" in case I misunderstand the British English accents and 19th century England's words and phrasing.  Also, there is a slightly crisper and more vibrant color quality to this Blu-ray version.  Unfortunately, there are no extras such as the making of or interviews.As for the content, this is close to a perfect version of Jane Austen's story.  True, some of the actors are older looking or even less attractive than their characters are described, but that is nit-picking.  At least, this 1995 mini-series does not add or take away in portraying her novel.  Other reviewers have written detailed contrasts so I'll leave it to them.  Another accurate to the original story version is the 1980 Pride and Prejudice starring Elizabeth Garvie."	5.0	Finally Captions	2013-01-07	0	0	0

I have rented it twice since, and am still amazed by how terrific it is! I am a junior in college, and the last time I rented it my two roomates and I  didn't move from the couch for six straight hours. All of the acting is  excellent, as is the chemistry between Darcy and Elizabeth. Seeing this  movie has led me to read P&amp;P as well as Jane Austen's other novels. I  have seen the other versions, and neither is as true to the story and  characters as this one is. I would recommend this to anyone.	5.0	Amazing Austen Adaptation	2000-05-15	2	2	0

I have the two-hour version starring Kiera Knightly that I also love and had watched many times before even reading the book. After reading the book I realized there was so much more to the story than could be told in two hours. So, I searched for a longer version and, after reading many reviews, decided on this one. It does an excellent job of telling the entire story. I highly recommend it.	5.0	Great version!!	2013-04-29	0	0	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A28MCN2LZPQ2K9	Trotwood Traddles	Naturally, to make a perfect adaption of Pride and Prejudice would be more than impossible, but this one really does come as close as any I've seen.  Jennifer Ehle is a very convincing Elizabeth Bennett, and Colin Firth surprising good as everyone's favorite, the ingeneous Mr. Darcy.  This version stays religiously close to the text, if I am not much mistaken there is not a single line of dialogue changed or ommitted, and if they are the changes are so slight that the most grumpy critique couldn't quibble over them much.  Mr. Wickham and all three of the younger Bennett sisters are very well cast, although Jane was in my opinion a very poor choice, and my biggest problem with the movie.  Mr. Bingley was not what I would call an excellent casting choice, but he was not horrible either, excepting the fact that he looks like he has 'fro, and it doesn't suit him.  Lady Catherine is very very good, at least I thought she was, although I have heard opinions to the extreme opposite.  It really depends on if you like that sort of Lady Katherine or go more for the Judi Dench sort.Mr. Collins is very painful, very good indeed.  Mrs. Bennett I thought a little over-played, if that is possible, Mr. Bennett on the better side of middling.However, the story is very respectfully handled, which is to me the most important thing.  I can freely recommend it.	4.0	As close as we've come	2006-01-08	5	4	1

I immediately went out and purchased the movie to quench my newfound obsession for Jane Austen's amazing story :)  The movie is delightful.  It was pure joy to see Austen's witty words spoken with all the marvelous acting and period dress and scenery.  Colin Firth, now famous as Mr. Darcy, plays the role superbly with subtlety and depth.  Jennifer Ehle as the ""headstrong"" Eliza Bennet is also delightful, and it is fun to pour over their scenes together and witness the nuances of emotion.

I've read the book and I know all the words by heart, I'm sure.  I love the era this store came from....I love the thought and dreams Jane must have had when writing it.  This book, this movie will never become old or out of date.....ever.  Generation after generation has and will love this book.  It makes me sad that Jane Austen never knew how important her work was to become, to so many; or how long her words would live on; or how many &#34;Austenites&#34; she would ultimately create.  These are Jane Austens words, written in her time, for her time....her modern day romance.  And I love her era, her interpretation of world, with her glimpses of how she felt it should change.  She wanted so badly for the women of her day to have more of a voice, more control of their destinies.  Wouldn't she be amazed if she could see us all now.	5.0	Pride And Prejudice.....what can anyone say....	2012-12-09	1	1	0

So Austen purists will point out that the mini-series was not, in fact, exactly like the book.  But in all major respects, these videos follow the Jane Austen book wonderfully - making this miniseries the best dramatization of any book that I've seen.  The casting was also wonderful - I can't imagine anyone else but Colin Firth making a convincing Darcy, with all that character's layers.This is a series that I pull out when it's nasty outside, and watch with a nice cup of tea.

I am not sure if I am biased since I saw that one first. I just though it felt fresh and lively. And Kiera as Lizzie did a much better job than the actress in this mini-series. That is not to say I dislike this version. On the contrary, I found it intriguing and never dull, even at the 6 hour length. I absolutely adored Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. He was perfection and my favorite part of the mini-series.The costumes were lovely to look at as well as the scenery. The soundtrack was lacking however, I barely even noticed it while watching. Despite the lack of certain qualities that I thought were abundant in the newer version, this is a solid period piece and anyone who is a lover of such films should watch this.	4.0	A long, but never boring mini-series	2008-03-11	2	2	0

The on screen chemistry between Elizabeth (Jennifer Ehle)and Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) is so intense and believable that you'd swear they loved one another in real life.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2WLHX0B22Z5I	Volvi	Im not going to review this particular production, theres over 1700 reviews here already what can I say that has not been said. So I will rather do a comparison between this Firth version and the later version which I will call the knightley version. So allow me pray to copy over what I reveiwed there:I bought both versions at the same time the Firth 1995 and the Knightley version. Which to watch first was my initial dilemma. I decided on the above shorter 2hr. Knightley version first and it was the right decision after having now watched watched both versions. Unlike any devout P&P; fan and not having seen either versions before, I at least can watch it for what it is without any pre-conceived notions. It wasnt long into watching this version which I will call the Knightley version, that I noticed a problem with the sound. I couldnt work out if it was me, the player or the transfer. Five to ten minutes in and I said to myself I cant the heck make out what theyre talking about. Dialogue was drowned out by over-powering background music and ran so fast. I had no choice but to start it again and put the subtitles on which as pointed out by another reviewer were often 3 liners and placed which was a nuisance. For that alone I had to drop 1 star when I would have awarded it 5 stars.Sure there was 'Poetic License' taken in this Knightley version. Like theyre manor was more like a farmhouse and very rough and hardly an upper middle to high class. Donald Sutherland though a great actor imho didnt suit his part, he hardly resembled the English Gentleman of his time, more like Colonial America civil war period. These things aside I found the Knightley version to be more dynamic then the Firth version. This version gave more goose bumps, lumps in throat and emotional tears. Knightley was perfect in her role she was more dynamic and head strong then in previos version. What you didnt see in this 2 hr.version I saw in the Firth version to fill in the gaps. Which is why I decided on the right version to start of my viewing. So all in all, dont miss this version, it was beautiful even with some of its flaws. It is as I say far more dynamic then the previous Firth version. I also preferred Darcy in this version.If you found this review helpful at all please vote on it. Thanks. Pleasant viewing.	4.0	Comparison of both Blu Ray versions	2010-03-12	8	2	6

For some reason, the picture quality of the movie is somehow ""paled"" in comparison to the earlier DVD release version which, even though has some digital glitches, has warmness to it.  I tried to compensate by adjusting the TV color, hue, brightness, etc. but to no avail.  Despite this new version having bonuses, I think they're not worth it if the movie itself suffered from the enhancement.  I wished I didn't give away my original copy.  Now, I'm only reviewing the DVD, not the movie.  The movie is absolutely fantastic.  I never get tired of watching it.

Mrs. Bennett is a little over-the-top, but all of the other  characterizations are superb.  We have watched this repeatedly with only a  month or two between viewings, and it holds up exceedingly well.  Like all  great works, each time you watch, you see something you missed before.  We  don't have the self-control to watch it one episode a week, as it was  produced.  We typically start about 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon, watch  the first three episodes, break for dinner, and then watch the rest.  (Sometimes we even eat while watching the second half!)

Every character's photography looks exceptional--the costuming, the lace, hair and skin, the eyes and lips, not to mention the foregrounds and the backgrounds.  The leaves and flowers, the brickwork outlining the Regency architecture, the oil paintings and room decor--all so clear that the picture appears almost 3-D.  This photographic restoration has been masterfully accomplished, even better than that of Gone With the Wind.  The subtitles keep up with the dialogue and are brightly displayed.As to the quality of the translation of this Jane Austin classic to the screen, from the hundreds of five-star reviews posted, this adaptation of Pride & Prejudice is enormously popular.

While this particular BBC series was made in 1995, and there are numerous other versions of it,it in my opinion is the best having won multiple awards both in England and the USA. The cinematography is marvelous, as are the settings and costumes. It continues to be a source of amazement of how Jane Austen  continues to appeal to each new generation who learn about her. Her books rarely go out of print and the interest lives on.No DVD collection in my opinion is complete without this version.	5.0	Pride and Prejudice(Blu-Ray)	2011-03-19	1	1	0

It's true that Elizabeth in this adaptation is a bit stuffy and was perfectly performed in the 40's version.  However, the screenplay, the script, and the surroundings were beautiful and more than made up for any little stuffiness.  The length of this movie was perfect, as you truly felt that you were watching the book unfold exactly as you had imagined it while reading it.  Colin Firth is the epitome of Mr. Darcy in this movie and I wouldn't have any one else play the part.  He captivated me from the start and made me despise him and love him at the same time.  He created quite a stir in America with this part and I can honestly say, stole my heart!  The other characters in the movie are in no way lacking and give the background support the way they were intended to, without taking away attention from Lizzy and Mr. Darcy.  I highly recommend this movie and intend to buy it myself.  I might as well as I have already rent it enough to have paid for three copies!	5.0	Worthy of love	2003-03-22	4	4	0
6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1YQS7S1IE53SB	Wendy C. Rigney	"What can be said that no one else has?Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle both shine as Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet.  The chemistry cannot be beat, and Ms. Ehle portrays Elizabeth as the fiery young woman I believe Jane Austen had envisioned.  There are no words to describe the magnificent portrayal of Mr. Darcy by Colin Firth.  This Mr. Darcy is no ""one-trick pony"".  Yes, Mr. Darcy first comes across as almost boorish.  But thanks to Firth's polished nuance, we see the inevitable evolution from cold prideful aristocrat to a kindhearted man in love without the evolution becoming corny or contrived.  Mr. Darcy is fully fleshed out.  It's evident just what his sister, Georgianna, means to him.  The same applies to his growing respect, admiration, and love for Elizabeth.  Firth can say tons with his eyes than most can with pages and pages of dialogue.  (OK, OK, so it doesn't hurt that Mr. Firth is also gorgeous.  Lake scene, anyone?  He makes six hours fly by in a rush, making you wish there was more to watch.)Jennifer Ehle impressed me greatly with her interpretation of Elizabeth.  She had the aura of kindness that Elizabeth was supposed to possess, but that kindness did not make her too soft.  She had keen wit, intelligence, and passion under the surface.  It is these characteristics that makes Firth/Ehle sparkle.  Firth's Darcy meets Ehle's Elizabeth comment for comment.  (The dance at the Netherfield Ball, and the ensuing barbed exchange, is a particularly favorite scene of mine.)  That chemistry absorbs you and leaves you impatient for more.  The movie may be 300 minutes long, but it feels far less.Add in a first-rate supporting cast, vibrant outdoor location scenes, beautiful musical score, and wonderful (and time appropriate!) costumes, and this edition of ""Pride and Prejudice"" does not miss a step.  I could not begin to recommend it enough."	5.0	A sublime adaption of a magnificent novel!	2002-05-04	2	2	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A18M68DE1Y6W51	Wendy Kaplan	I have wanted Mister Darcy ever since my first reading of Jane Austen's brilliant classic. And at last he is mine, all mine, courtesy of this spectacular BBC/A&amp;E dramatization.Colin Firth is, as readers of &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; well know, the perfect Mister Darcy. In fact, he IS Mister Darcy...his haughty looks, his handsome face, his lordly bearing...his very subtly exposed vulnerability when he looks at Elizabeth Bennett. Jennifer Ehle, with her fresh English looks and her captivating face, is a charming Elizabeth. In fact, the casting contributes in no small way to the brilliance of this feature. From the smallest character to the leads, everyone is as I imagined them to be from my many, many readings of the book.Add to this the lush photography, the perfect period detail (furniture, clothing, countryside, village, even the militia's red coats) and you simply swoon with pleasure. As one of the filmmakers remarks in the special feature: &quot;Every time I read the book, I hold my breath hoping that Elizabeth and Mister Darcy wind up together, even though I KNOW they do.&quot; Exactly. And it is the same with the film--some parts, where each haughtily insults the other--actually make the viewer nervous. Will they REALLY wind up together? Or has the DVD morphed in the night and it won't happen?Happily, all is well. The short extras on casting, the making of the film and such are mildly interesting...not really a spectacular addition to the film itself. In fact, I wish I had not seen the stunt that ends up on film with Mister Darcy diving into the lake. It took something away from the fantasy of the film. Nevertheless, I treasure this DVD almost as much as my own worn copy of the book.	5.0	Just Call Me Mrs. Darcy...	2003-04-07	5	3	2

I love this movie and was excited to find out that there was an restored blue-ray version to buy.  I bought it and received it; and to my dismay when I opened and played it, the picture was all grainy - literally.  I immediately sent it back.  Amazon return policy is awesome.  I asked for a replacement Blue-ray. The replacement came a few days later. I opened it and to my dismay I found this blue-ray to be exactly the same as the one I returned.  I was in total shock.  This is there Blue-ray version, seriously!  I skimmed through the blue ray and to see if picture quality was really that bad all they way through. It was, and I found out that the sound quality sucked as well.  I was like wow this is just awful.  So I am sending this one back as well and getting a refund.  I am hoping this is just a bad batch of Blue-rays. I don't know.  I find it hard to believe that any company would put out something that bad on purpose.  I played this on two different Blue-rays players.  One is the Sony play station the other is a Toshiba.

Which is to say, the background music is mixed up too high in some of the scenes (especially at the balls), making the dialogue a little bit hard to understand for those of us who may have attended one too many Rolling Stones concerts.The bad mix wouldn't be an issue except that there are no subtitles provided with this edition. I'm surprised to discover that A&amp;E and the English media companies aren't sensible enough to routinely supply subtitles for their cache of chickflic gems (Brideshead Revisited doesn't have them either) so that those of us in the Estados Unidos can make sense of that special brand of the King's English spoken on the emerald isle.	4.0	Five-star adaptation with two-star audio	2003-03-04	4	2	2

The miniseries itself is amazing, of course, and the special features are thorough and insightful.  There are some scenes I shall never look at the same way again!But here's my caveat... and I am not sure if it's a defect with my disc or a more widespread problem... I found that there was ""noise"" in the picture off and on throughout, on both discs, mainly on lighter flesh and fabrics.  But suddenly as it appeared, it would go away!  And then, towards the very end, when Darcy and Elizabeth are taking their walk, the picture loses resolution for a couple minutes.  It's as if they put in a sampling of what they had to work with, pre-restoration.  But I have a feeling that's not the case, because it's quite distracting during such an important scene.  I may exchange it through Amazon and see if another copy does the same things."	4.0	*Almost* perfect...	2012-01-17	4	4	0

This rendition is faithful to the book and holds one's interest throughout.  I enjoyed Ms. Knightly's version when I saw it but this one is superior.I've noticed a tendency lately to superimpose modern mores on these old stories--for instance kissing in public, where a couple appears to be fighting for sole possession of the same wad of gum.  This is probably done to try to improve interest--and therefore marketability--to a young adult audience.  But it would have been unheard of to display that much passion in public in that society and during that period.	5.0	Old English mate-shopping among the rich and famous	2008-06-14	4	4	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1UJ1MDZ23Q43J	"""wlxqqme"""	This version is far and away the best and truest representation of Austen's P&amp;P book. The costuming is incredible, the scenery sublime, the acting flawless - in a word, utter and complete perfection. I especially loved seeing the beautiful English countryside displayed so magnificently. Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth Bennet are brilliantly portrayed. The entire cast deserves a standing ovation for representing their characters so tremendously well. (Mrs. Bennet is a hoot!) If you enjoy period pieces, then you will love this film! I was most impressed with the way that the dialogue endeavours to remain true to Austen's original work (though I'm certain it was no easy task for the actors). Can I give it more than 5 stars???

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A188NTJ5LV8LA4	Wm19	"I have this series on regular DVD and watch the entire series at least once a month.  However, the regular DVD quality looks like a VHS home copy from the '80's; uneven, fuzzy and bleached out.  So I ordered the Blu-ray version from the UK (it's not out in North America yet, and Blu-ray is zone-free) and it came from amazon.co.uk within a week.The Blu-ray improvement has to be seen to be believed.  The background, horses, dresses, colours, rooms, were all amazing.  I had never noticed many of these details in the regular DVD.  As I was watching it the first time, I kept on saying to myself, I didn't realize that room was pink, or that Lydia was wearing blue, or that Charlotte Lucas only wore purple.  The detail on the outdoor scenes and the indoor rooms is amazing.  On the Blu-ray, the colours are very rich, and it looks so new, it actually looks like a 2009 version of Pride and Prejudice.An additional advantage is that they re-did the audio.  I caught conversations that I had missed before (who knew that Mr. Hurst had more than 1 line?).  Even Mrs. Bennet wasn't half as annoying because her voice was no longer so tinny.Apparently they went back to the actual film negatives and restored it frame by frame (it's explained in a technical featurette). That's why the colour and audio are so improved.There are only 2 downsides. One is that with the higher amount of detail, Elizabeth Bennet is not quite so creamy-skinned and beautiful as she is in the bleached out regular DVD.  The other is that it has 2 new featurettes, but not the ""making of pride and prejudice"" which is present on the regular DVD version.Given the price, the huge improvement in the video quality and sound, I would highly recommend this blu-ray version."	5.0	Incredible improvement	2009-02-22	18	17	1

There must be a nice respect for the author, that people tend to be both careful and faithful.  Costume dramas are always nice to look at, but preserving the essential Austin dialog gives it that extra bite.&quot;Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (1996)&quot; is a lovely, funny, romantic presentation of a classic English novel.  In terms of eye candy, the estates are grand, both inside and out, and the costumes are appropriately beautiful.  The BBC definitely delivers when it comes to presenting England's splendors.  The actors are all perfectly cast, and each delivers and outstanding performance.  Collin Firth is excellent as the brooding Mr. Darcy.  Alison Steadman and Benjamin Whitrow are a constant source of amusement and wit as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet.  Julia Sawalha as Lydia plays the exact opposite of her Absolutely Fabulous character Saffron.  Jennifer Ehle is really the perfect Elizabeth Bennet.  There is a lot to be said for &quot;a pair of fine eyes.&quot;The DVD presentation is really superior for these types of shows.  With such fantastic scenery, a widescreen presentation is necessary.  The Special Edition fixes many errors present in previous offerings.

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1POFVVXUZR3IQ	Z Hayes	Of all the screen adaptations of Pride and Prejudice, this 1996 adaptation is my favorite. It is not only beautifully-filmed, but the casting is excellent, and it stays very faithful to the novel. The other two adaptations which I like are the 1981 adaptation starring Elizabeth Garvie as Eliza Bennet and the austerely handsome David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy. Unfortunately, because of its age, the production qualities are rather weak and the entire production looks washed out on-screen. Despite this, the 1981 version is well-cast and is the most faithful adaptation of Austen's novel. The most recent adaptation, the film version starring Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew McFadyen as Mr. Darcy has a haunting score and is lushly filmed, and quite the most romantic of all three adaptations. The chemistry between Darcy and Elizabeth is palpable indeed! Yet, because of the time constraints (it only runs to about 2 hours), so much in the novel is left out, and many liberties are taken. Despite that, I loved it.Back to this 1996 adaptation - I have watched this BBC adaptation of Pride & Prejudice more than a dozen times, and I still love it! It never fails to transport me into Austen's world, & makes me yearn to remain there for as long as I can. My fantasies notwithstanding, I must say that the cast of this adaptation do an excellent job. The roles are matched perfectly to the actors & actresses, and the two leads are PERFECT!I think these are the defining roles for Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth Bennet) & Colin Firth (Mr. Darcy). The Pemberley portrayed in this adaptation is my favorite. Julia Sawalha (who went on to play the lead actress in Lark Rise to Candleford) is simply audacious in the role of the wanton and vulgar Lydia Bennet! The ending of this adaptation is just perfect:)	5.0	Jane Austen's classic tale of love in a glorious adaptation	2011-09-01	0	0	0

6303921248	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (Six Piece Collector's Boxed Set) [VHS]	AU61CID785ACB	Zuberdeen	Pride and Prejudice has been my favorite of Jane Austen's books ever since I first read it in high school. When the A & E miniseries came out in 1996, I had high hopes because I had read about the producer's devotion to the book. I was not disappointed; I loved everything about it! The costumes are correct, the setting is ideal with amazing Regency details in every shot, and the acting is spot on. The Bennett family and all the other characters are exactly as I imagined them, due to the tremendous performances by the whole cast.Benjamin Whitrow is perfect as the long-suffering Mr. Bennett; his dry sense of humor really comes through. Alison Steadman is hilarious as Mrs. Bennett (all fluff and histrionics), and Crispin Bonham-Carter makes a very sweet Bingley. Julia Sawalha is sassy as the irrepressible (and irresponsible) Lydia. David Bamber (also plays Cicero in HBO's Rome) is tremendous fun as Mr. Collins, and Barbara Leigh-Hunt steals every scene as Lady Catherine deBourgh.But of course, the two best performances come from Jennifer Ehle as Miss Elizabeth Bennett and Colin Firth as (sigh) Mr. Darcy. There is so much chemistry between them, and it is a joy to watch their verbal parrying. Both of these actors have very expressive eyes, and when Lizzie comes to the rescue of Darcy's sister Georgiana, the look that passes between Lizzie and Darcy is unmistakable: there is now no doubt that they are meant to be together. Colin Firth makes Darcy look so totally and completely in love at this point, it makes me swoon every time I see it! ;-)Which brings me to my final point: my husband and I have watched this DVD many times and we seem to enjoy it more with every viewing. This is a classic and by far the best interpretation of Pride and Prejudice that I have ever seen. (Okay, I know the pond scene isn't in the book, but it's so fun I thought it was a nice addition). Love it, love it, love it!	5.0	Oh, Mr. Darcy . . .	2007-08-21	3	2	1
