6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A3HS5U2UUSQP0N	"&#34; Anti Microchip &#34; ""Jesus Christ can ..."	There is little I can add to what everyone else has already stated. To make this review to the point this movie is a breath of fresh air. Not having seen the movie prior to a few years ago I now see what I've been missing out on. An entertaining and well produced older movie with a moral slant to it. Sure it's whimsical in places and Santa Claus is not your typical grandiose version you find in modern films. However, there is an innocence that this film has that has long been destroyed in modern christmas movies. I highly recommend every family to sit down and watch this oldie every year. You won't regret it.	4.0	Refreshing	2009-12-26	1	1	0

When I inserted the colorized version into the DVD player, it aid that the disc is not formatted for this region. In the description above it says that is is formatted for this region. I don't understand. I can still watch the B/W version so all is not lost ... Just wish that I could watch the colorized version also.UPDATE: I was playing the DVD in a computer (so that I could watch it with a family members house) and it said that ""it could not play in this region"" but, I came home and put it in my TV and both the colorized version (that I was having trouble with) and the B/W version played !I'm happy!!"	5.0	This disc is not formatted for this region	2012-12-21	1	0	1
6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	'Miracle on 34th Street' is still an enduring holiday movie.  There is a lot of novelty to draw upon.  A man from a nursing home takes over the Santa helm at Macy's Department store and has all the charm and warmth to replace his drunken predecessor in a pinch. He's liked well enough until he takes the role seriously enough to proclaim he is 'the' Santa Claus and even writes it on his job form.  Although endearing, he alarms his employer who objects when he insists to his daughter (Natalie Wood, who looks the same when she's grown up, only smaller) that Santa is the real and he's the real McCoy.  The cynical won't have it, and Macy's psychiatrist and a local politician behind the judge (William Frawley, later Fred of 'I Love Lucy' fame) analyse the situation until it becomes a ticklish affair among the press.  With some realistic acting by key players and a fun premise that is both fanciful and true-to-life, 'Miracle on 34th Street' is believable enough to keep us all going.	3.0	Santa on Trial	2006-12-29	6	0	6
6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A2FVM8VAH429RQ	3dmike	Unfortunately in the case of Miracle on 34th Street, the higher resolution of Blu-ray translates into an overly contrasty image with a lot of noise (I mean a lot of noise)  It is a shame that such a classic movie was not properly remastered.  The image quality, to my eye almost unwatchable.  The softer image of the dvd version is a little better.  The standard for quality Blu-ray black and white reissue of a classic movie is Casa Blanca.  This is an example of the kind of result possible when people actually care about quality.	2.0	poor video quality	2011-12-20	3	2	1
6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A1166FE81ADOUR	50s sci-fi Fan	"Christmas is not Christmas to me without this film. Edmund Gwenn must come close to everybody's ideal of Santa Claus/Father Christmas, the kindly, good humored grandfather. The adult rules and casual opportunism  are no match for  childlike innocent warmth of the story.Kringle subsitutes at the Macy's Christmas Parade for the Company's drunken Santa and ends up being hired by Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) to play Santa in the store. All goes well for a while, even when he sents shoppers to rival stores for better bargains. Mr.Macy is quick use this as a gimmick when shoppers are so moved by a ""big company putting the spirit ahead of the commercial"" they promise to become loyal  Macy's customers.The trouble starts when Kringle begins to insist that he really IS Santa. He winds up in court before Judge Henry X. Harper (Gene Lockhart) for a hearing on his sanity. Political organiser Charlie Halloran (William Frawley:""I Love Lucy."") urges Harper to excuse himself from the case because he's coming up for election and the last thing he needs is a ""no-win"" controversy.The unfortunate Harper has already committed himself, but he is facile enough to put Kringle's lawyer, Fred Gailey (John Payne)in the hot seat. Gailey feels lost, but seizes on coincidence for a surprising and obvious solution!However Gailey's self-confidence, so boosted by triumph, is soon undermined by astonishing evidence of the Christmas spirit.The film was made in 1947 so some creative reading between the lines of such dialogue as, Maybe [Kringle's] only a little crazy, like some of those men in Washington,"" have some allusions to the concurrent HUAC hearings. But then I may have been influenced by a lot or reading I've done about the period."	5.0	Timeless as Christmas itself	2006-11-12	9	6	3

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A3UT41TWD7N0D5	AbeStreet	I first saw this film when I was 13 years old and it instantly became one of my favorite films and is still so 20 years later.  On the surface the film seems somewhat unbelievable.  The story of a man who thinks he is Kris Kringle (aka Santa Claus)somehow convinces major department stores that they should put the interest of the consumer above their own interests and then attempts to prove in court he is the one and only Santa Claus is somewhat unbelievable.  However, the great cast, the well written story and the time this film was released, just after WWII, makes the story seem almost plausible.I really enjoy the final scene in the film in which Fred Gailey, the attorney who defended Kris Kringle, is commenting to Doris Walker on the believability of Santa Claus when he notices something in the corner that makes him reconsider the statement he is making.  This scene is so important because it shows the hypocrisy that man can have.  Here we have  man who has encouraged others to believe in Santa Claus and even defended a man who claims to be Santa Clause even though he may not believe in Santa Claus himself and now he is forced to reconsider his beliefs.I have seen the 73 and 94 remake of this film and while I did enjoy the 73 version &amp; hated the 94 version neither are better than the original.  There is a 1956 version of the film called MEET KRIS KRINGLE that is never aired and not available for purchase that I would like to see.  I saw a clip of that film and the actor that portrays Kris Kringle seems far less believable than Edmund Gwenn.  The actress the portrays Susan seems a little older and no where near as charming as Natalie Wood.  However I would still like to see the version if for no other reason I can then say I've seen all 3 remakes of this film.I purchased the didgitally remastered VHS version of this film and found it be an excellent product.  Great picture and sound.  I really enjoyed the orginal trailer.  I wanted to purchase the DVD but found that it offered nothing different than the VHS version.  This film deserves special features. Behind the scene footage and a documentary would be nice.  Several of the actors and actresses are still alive including Maureen O'Hara that could provide commentary for this film.  So until the DVD producers add some more material to this DVD I will just use my VHS version.	5.0	Great film and Great story.  Good VHS, Fair DVD.	2002-11-29	2	2	0
6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A1HRYC60VTMYC0	Ace	"Absolutely LOVED and identified with this movie!I was ""there"" -- on many a Thanksgiving Day, on 6th Avenue watching the Macy*s parade, just a few years after this eternally delightful movie was filmed. And when I was little, everything, especially Santa, was breathtakingly real. No matter that I froze my little tail off standing on 34th Street and 6th Avenue for hours (starting at 7 am, so we could get a good view of the parade!) -- on each and every Thanksgiving Day, my heart was warmed by the floats, the merriment, and....especially, Santa.So naturally, while watching this movie, I almost felt like I could look into the crowd and see....me!!! I can really relate to this movie!!The casting was perfection! From the unbelieving shop owner and his reindeer props, to the innocent little boy on the witness stand, from the bustling crowds in the street, to the interior of the typical (for that era) NY apartment building, the cast of characters and the sets were totally realistic.And I loved the little girl played by cute little Natalie Wood -- hey back then, when I was 5 years old, I even WORE outfits just like hers!!!What's NOT to love in this movie!!???Although I never chanced on this movie until the 1970's (which left me and my ""little"" sister awestruck), I have watched it faithfully every year since then. Each time I see it, I feel like I'm watching it for the first time over and over again -- this movie still speaks volumes to me.The funniest part of the movie (to me and Sis, anyway!) is when the Macy*s executive's wife (who is totally snockered) answers the (old, heavy, cast iron, just like my grandma's) phone.And the most breathtaking part of the movie-- well...is that really Kris Kringle's cane there, over in the corner?This movie should be ""required viewing"" in every grade school."	5.0	This little kid, who watched the Macy*s Parade in 1950's,	2003-11-28	3	3	0
6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A2T4R3A2IL45Z0	A Customer	This classic tells the story of Santa Clause coming to NYC working at MACY's and is put in a mental hospital due to lack of belief and superstition.  It has everything from laughter to romance to supense to  leaving you with a happy feeling.  It is a great film to put you in the  holiday spirit.  This film looks better and sounds better than ever on  DVD!  This film was made before 1955 so no WIDESCREEN version will ever  show up.  This is the best way to own this old classic and any other  classic for that matter!	5.0	One of the Best Christmas films EVER!	2000-06-22	0	0	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A3MV1KKHX51FYT	Acute Observer	"The film begins with the supervisor of the parade assigning people to their posts. Isn't it always difficult with people hired for a one-day job? Then we see her daughter, raised as a  sensible, rational little adult. As compensation for her failed marriage, or a symptom of the failure? Some say you should never lie to a child, like telling them about Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, or other legends. But doing so prepares them for life: they will be lied to by rulers, advertisers, employers, friends, and relatives. Get used to it, kid!The story is that the real Kris Kringle shows up to play Santa Claus - which he does to perfection. He is ""too good to be true"". This film contrasts the legends to the realities of adult life. What would happen if everyone spoke the truth as they knew it? Is this film a warning against forcing children to grow up too soon?Susan Walker tells Santa Claus what she really wants: a home with a backyard where she can play. Isn't that what every child should have? After happily married parents? One scene shows Mr. Macy shaking hands with Mr. Gimbel; is this a comment on world conflicts? Another scene discusses the ""guilt complex"" of givingaway gifts. Does this explain the charities of Carnegie, Rockefeller, and the others?The story continues with Kris Kringle brought into court for a sanity hearing. Anybody who doesn't believe in Santa Claus, or lawyers, should see this. Yes, the scenario is rigged, just like a lot of life. Or maybe some court cases? Does public opinion affect trials like in this film? Do political bosses advisejudges in real life? How do you think judges get appointed? Kris Kringle's lawyer persists in his defense, even at the cost of his job. He will defend ordinary people against their oppressors. The political boss explains the economics of the Santa Claus legend, a fact that cannot be denied.Since the Post Office has a ton of dead letters, they decide to send them to the courtroom. His identity is thus authenticated by the US Government! The ending is drawn out, but little Susan finally gets her Christmas present. ""You have to have faith"" says her mother. And another happy ending to a Hollywood movie.The saddest fact is that Natalie Wood never lived long enough to play the mother in the remake. Real life doesn't always have a happy ending."	5.0	Is Santa Claus a Menace to Society?	2003-04-06	2	1	1
6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A3JXOXKWOIETIY	"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse"""	"Many of us have seen Miracle on 34th Street many times (once a year), and for me it never wears out.  Just seeing Edmund Gwenn convince the sceptical, but adorable Natalie Wood that he's Santa is always both moving and hilarious.  The theme is that sometimes good (Gwenn) triumphs over evil (Sawyer) with a little luck and magic (unfortunately not this year though.)The way the plot is put into place is masterful and George Seaton's direction flawless.  Maureen O'Hara and John Payne (Gailey) do a great job and if you listen carefully you can hear O'Hara's Irish accent creep in.  Also great is the judge played by Gene Lockhart who gives his role just the right dash of comedy, as well as William Frawley (better known as Fred on I Love Lucy).The swipe it takes at psychiatry is too mild though.  It depicts Sawyer as a fake psychiatrist...not challenging the legitimacy of psychiatry itself.  However the message gets subtly through...there are those in the profession ""with no humanity"" as Kris Kringle puts it.Even though you know the outcome it's still great to watch the triumphant result of Gailey's efforts, as well as Kringle's winning over of everyone at the end.To me THIS is the quintessential Christmas film, not Wonderful Life or Christmas Carol which are too sentimental and dated.  Miracle is intelligent, human, and timeless."	5.0	Please ignore the remakes and see this magical original	2004-12-25	6	4	2

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A12AT7IWTZ39MN	A. England	"A wonderful Christmas story, well-written, and fun to watch. Natalie Wood plays a precocious little girl whose mother, (played by Maureen O'Hara) obviously hurt and disillusioned by life, is determined that her daughter is grounded in reality and truth - never using her imagination or pretending, and of course believing that Santa Claus is a myth. From there we have the story of Santa Claus, Macy's Department Store, a handsome lawyer neighbor, a crazy ""psychologist"", a lawsuit, and the blossoming of ""faith"". I enjoy the new version of this classic, but the old has great charm, & should be included in the list of great movies to be watched during the holidays.Addendum: Just watched the newer version with Elizabeth Perkins, & although we like this one, we are all agreed as a family: The old version is much better!

I've only seen the remakeMiracle on 34th Streeton cable, which I liked, and so I decided to check out the original.Needless to say that I enjoyed it immensely!The story is about an old man (Edmund Gwenn won Oscar for this role) who believes he is Kris Kringle (Santa) and tries to convince a young girl (Natalie Wood) to believe in Santa Claus, too. He not only has to convince the little girl, but he also has to convince the state of New York when he's put on trial to be declared insane.At its heart, the story is really about believing and never giving up on dreams and miracles. Perhaps this is why MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET has become such an enduring holiday classic.There are two DVDs in this set:===== DVD 1 =====Colorized Movie with optional commentary by Maureen O'Hara.== The colorized version didn't bother me and wasn't strange looking at all, but for purists, the black and white version is on DVD 2.===== DVD 2 =====Black & White Original Movie and Special Features*** AMC (AMERICAN MOVIE CLASSICS) BACKSTORY-22:04-minutes== Behind the scenes special on the making of ""Miracle On 34th Street"" with actors Maureen O'Hara (""Doris Walker""), Robert Hyatt (""Thomas Mara, Jr.""), Alvin Greenman (""Alfred""), Lana Wood (Natalie Wood's sister) and others.

No mention of Edmund Gwenn, Maureen O'Hara, John Payne or Natalie Wood, the feature stars of this Oscar winning movie. In my opinion, this was the very best version of which there were many. Don't care for seeing it colorized..but someone mentioned it was also in black & white. I'm not planning to buy the blu ray because I don't see how they could improve on the original. Haven't seen anything in blu-ray that warrants buying it, but my husband seems to.As far as the movie is concerned, this is a very endearing film. How can you not love the diminutive Edmund Gwenn as Santa Claus? Natalie Wood does a wonderful job and is very believable when ""Chris"" blows the bubblegum bubble that snaps. If you don't have Miracle on 34th Street in any version, I'd say run out, buy and enjoy it over and over.

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A10PW85QOA3G4W	Amazon Customer	The story is a classic and this original is one of the best.  However, as a Blu-ray we expected a bit more.  First, the cover shows the colorized version of the movie.  We expected to get both, you only get the black and white version.  In fact, that is all you get.

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A1XLYHIZZJMOMN	American	When looking for another movie to add to our Christmas Collection, this one stood out for several reasons. First, it was something from and earlier age, which I've come to appreciate more and more. Secondly, the plot was interesting enough to investigate further. So, without much ado, the movie was ordered with great anticipation. However, when it arrived and we gave it a first viewing, we were MORE THAN OVER-JOYED at the wonderful storyline and acting! This great movie classic far surpassed any of our expectations, and we watched it two nights in a row, with even more satisfaction the second viewing! This was a great purchase, a great addition to our Christmas Collection, and a very moving and touching story indeed. This movie possesses all the elements of the Christmas spirit and season, including some early scoffers as to the reality (or not) of Santa Claus, and everything viewed through the eyes of a small child (young girl). Wonderful!I promise you -- if you're thinking about purchasing this movie for your own video collection, you cannot go wrong! You will not be disappointed but rather, surprised by the ending and filled with joy as result of the outcome! Wonderful! Thank you Hollywood, for making another great Christmas classic for each generation to enjoy and experience! Treat yourself with a great holiday gift that will continue to give and give and give every Christmas season! You'll be glad you did! I promise you.	5.0	A Wonderful Christmas Classic!	2014-04-04	0	0	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A30S2EFXHTP6TZ	"A movie lover ""Professor"""	This version is the classic one.  The setting is in New York City in the late 1940s, so it might seem a bit out of date for some viewers, but that should not be the case.  The acting is excellent, and the story is very moving.  The little girl is played by a young Natalie Wood, and her mother is played by Maureen O'Hara.  The male lead (not Santa) is John Payne.  These are all excellent actors, and they give wonderful performances.  I put this film in the same category as &#34;It's a Wonderful Life,&#34; which is the Christmas classic starring Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed.  I bought it because I like to see it over and over and to share the film with family (on loan only, of course).  It is a must see for children.  As for me, I like to see the film any time of the year when I need a mood adjustment.  It never fails.	5.0	It's a Wonderful Movie	2012-12-19	1	0	1

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A2C5D9IGOXNVB9	Andrew Sterland	I own both the B&W; blu ray and the 2006 colorised/b&w; dvd.  I haven't yet watched the dvd versions so, won't comment on those yet..  However, I watched the blu ray last night and have to say the studio has done a wonderful job transferring this spectacular and heartwarming film to blu ray.  I didn't notice one instance of the picture feeling too 'dark', nor does this blu ray contain a single nick, scratch or 'line' on the image.  It has been cleaned and touched up beautifully for the blu ray release.  My TV has been professionally calibrated, which also helps!Sound on the blu ray is great too.  Of course for a movie of 1947 the sound is going to be very 'mono'-like but, there wasn't a hint of treble 'harshness' that you hear from so many of these old movies transferred to dvd & blu ray.  It was smooth, and vocals were clear and crisp.  Full marks on this front.I actually bought both the colorised (2006) dvd, as well as the blu ray(the blu being b&w; only) - this was because independent web reviews indicate the colorisation of this movie was actually very good!  I'm yet to watch the color version but will post a review on that as well when I see it.  Both are on amazon and both are very cheap so, I'd recommend buying both!  You can't beat this wonderful movie in colorised version (so I've been told!)  B&W; on the blu ray is beautiful for the purists but, having a color copy is great as well - I'm sure it will enhance the experience and I'll be sure to post a review of the color version when I get a chance to watch.As for the blu ray though - just beautiful!  Highly recommended.	5.0	Such a great movie.  A great transfer to blu ray as well.	2012-11-20	2	2	0

For me its the ending when Susan runs down the stairs and tells her mother she was right &quot;mommy said even when things don't turn out just right you still have to believe, and oh mommy I do believe, I do&quot; and at that point I know I can feel the tears starting to come in my eyes and by the end I'm done for, but this is a beauitful movie, that can make anyone believe in Santa Claus :)	5.0	A Classic Christmas movie	2002-10-30	2	2	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	AXSH6O4OP5L4M	"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen"""	"Although I've seen other versions of this film, this is the one I enjoy the most, probably because I enjoy the nostalgia of the classic black and white cinematography and the ""Hollywood Era"" stars. There are colorized versions of it, but because I grew up with the black and white version, I prefer the latter.A very young Natalie Wood stars as the little girl Susan who doesn't believe in Santa Claus, because her mother has decided she should grow up practical and realistic about the world.  She's so dear and so precocious you can relate to her instantly.  Her attempt to learn about the Imagi-nation by imitating a monkey is classic.Edmund Gwenn is the ultimate Khris Kringle--although I did enjoy Sebastian Cabot's version also.  He's charming and loveable in the role, and whether you believe he is who he says he is or not, you definitely like him.Maureen O'Hara is at her most beautiful in the post war fashions of the 40s and is the thoroughly modern woman of her era.  A divorced, working Mom with no illusions about the world and the people in it, she gives Santa a greater task than her daughter does, since it's not just Santa in which she has lost faith.  This film was made in 1947 only a few years after the end of World War II, and women had only just achieved a degree of ""can do"" status because of their war time participation, so the film has some pretty interesting things to say about society.  Generally speaking, divorce for any reason had been considered a bad thing and divorced women had often been socially ostracized, so this is a great departure from earlier social norms.  The fact, however, that she is being encouraged to ""believe"" in Santa and abandon her pragmatism and independance may well be part of the move to return women to the ""good old days"" where their only role was the household.  Certainly the 1950s would see a far less light handed attempt to force women back into the home and subservience and convince them that they were a little too stupid to actually deal with life outside of it--at least in film.  This was more due to a radical about face of the film industry under the very real political threats posed by conservative elements during the McCarthy era than it was to the realities of life during the period.  Like it or not, real life would never be that simplistic and certainly by the 1960s both society and the cinema saw all ""hell break loose"" from the top to the bottom of society.  For a little while at least, there was a little warmth and charm at Christmas.A wonderful Christmas classic."	5.0	Lovely children's classic	2010-12-23	1	0	1

There are so many wonderful scenes, especially the one when Natalie Wood (the doubting seven year old) sees Santa (Edmund Gwenn) speaking in Dutch to the little, immigrant girl sitting on his knee in Macy's.  John Payne delivers an unforgettable performance as an up and coming lawyer who wants to get Natalie Wood's mom (Maureen O'Hara, who he likes alot) to believe their is indeed a Santa Claus.  He even defends in court Kris Kringle as the one and only Santa Claus by bringing in the US Postal Service to prove his identity!  Get the kids and grandkids together to enjoy this heart warming story of the miracle of Christmas happening not only on 34th Street, but in believers of Santa everywhere.	4.0	A Traditional Holiday Classic Which You'll Want To View Again And Again	2013-12-20	0	0	0
6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A31I3HXMD5H1EL	Benjamin J Burgraff	"When Maureen O'Hara, the top-billed star of 1947's ""Miracle on 34th Street"", proudly proclaims all three 'remakes' of the story were flops, it may sound a bit conceited...but she is absolutely right, the original IS the best...and THIS is the edition that is a MUST for your collection!Based on a story by Valentine Davies (who wondered how the real Santa Claus would react to the commercialization of Christmas), with an Oscar-winning screenplay by director George Seaton, the film is a triumph of perfect casting, perfect timing, and a sentimentality and humor that post-War America desperately needed. Contrary to general opinion, 20th Century Fox did not treat it as a 'minor' film (studio head Darryl F. Zanuck loved the story), but location shooting (at the first Macy's parade since the war began, as well as inside the store, during the Christmas 'rush') would push the budget to the limit.O'Hara (unhappily yanked from a long-awaited return to her Ireland home), and popular Fox leading man John Payne were cast in the leads, but the real 'stars' of the film are Oscar-winning 71-year-old Edmund Gwenn (who is absolutely perfect as 'Kris Kringle', and convinced everyone on the project that he really WAS Santa Claus), and 8-year-old Natalie Wood (the most gifted of the post-War child stars), who brings young Susan brilliantly to life. Their scenes together are so sweet and irresistable that the film positively glows!While elements of the story are 'dated' (the competition between Macy's and Gimbel's, the Postal information, etc.), it simply gives the 1947 version a 'timeless' quality that the 1994 version lacked...and in not attempting to incorporate 'magic' into the story (as the Attenborough production uncomfortably does), it actually seems MORE magical!Several supporting players should be singled out; Thelma Ritter (in her screen debut), is wonderful as a frazzled mom; Gene Lockhart (the judge) and William (""I Love Lucy"") Frawley (as the judge's campaign manager) are hilarious together; and Porter Hall, as the hiss able 'psychologist', Sawyer, is a perfect foil for Gwenn. The entire cast is superb!This edition offers both a B&W; AND 'colorized' version of the film, each featuring a warm commentary by O'Hara (taped at the 86-year-old actress' home, in Ireland), two documentaries (including scenes from the Thomas Mitchell, Sebastian Cabot, and Richard Attenborough versions), the bizarre trailer for the film, the complete 1955 TV production starring Mitchell, and a sentimental history of the parade.While the film was, indeed, originally released in the summer of 1947 (to maximize profits), it is a bona fide Christmas 'Classic', and should be an essential part of your holiday collection!"	5.0	Best Version of the Classic, with FABULOUS Special Features!	2006-12-12	15	15	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A20EEWWSFMZ1PN	"bernie ""xyzzy"""	I will not bore you with a recap of the whole movie or state, which is obvious to all that this 1947 black and white movie is one of the major Christmas Classics.Kris Kringle (Edmond Gwenn) is appalled to find a Santa preparing to be in the Thanks Giving Day parade is intoxicated.  Kris is hired to play the part of him self.  He befriends a child Susan (Natalie Wood) who does not believe in Santa or the tooth fairy or giants.  His employer Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) is dubious of her decision to hire him after learning that he believes he is Santa.  In the spirit of Christmas he brings two rival stores together and is in the process of bringing the girl around to believing.  Naturally I left out many other controversial questions and fun scenes.  Among them is one where a Dutch girl recognizes him as Santa and he speaks Dutch to her.Through a few misunderstandings he is put on trial and must prove he is Santa.  Can his friend, who happens to be a lawyer, prove this?  If not what will happen to him?  What effect will this have on Susan?  Or you?Them!

Macy's was one of our favorite stores to shop and visit and of course, see Santa Clause.  My mother would make a whole day of it, take the train into Grand Central Station, eat at the auto-mat, across the street, then on to Macy's.  With me came the family, brothers and sisters.

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A25UZ7MA72SMKM	Brent Butler	Every time I watch this film, I think I need to start believing in Santa Claus again. As a man who claims to be the real Santa Claus gradually wins the love and respect of those around him, you are meant to wonder if he's crazy, or if he IS the real Santa Claus. The movie more or less leaves you to make your own conclusion, but I don't have to tell you the way the smart money leans on the question! LOLNatalie Wood gave a very mature performance for a child star of the day. Her own progression from a matter of fact little girl with no fantasies to actually wondering about Kris Kringle is one of the many delights of the movie. Another entertaining sub-plot involves a public relations campaign launched by Macy's Department Store after an inadvertent action by Kris winds up generating unexpected customer goodwill. Then Gimbel's gets in on the act, and the famous rivalry between the two retail giants is quite amusing.Maureen O'Hara is as beautiful and vivacious as in all her roles, and Edmund Gwenn is perfect as Kris Kringle. John Payne's friendly attorney neighbor provides just the right hopeful counterbalance to the practical nature of Maureen's character.The DVD video transfer is crisp, and the soundtrack sounds great. The package comes with both the classic B&W; version of the film, and the later colorized version. The colorized DVD has never left the case. ;-)This is a must see film for all fans of Christmas holiday films. Its on our must see list each year along with A Christmas Carol (any of a few versions), It's a Wonderful Life, The Shop Around the Corner, White Christmas, Holiday Inn, and A Christmas Story.

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A141HP4LYPWMSR	Brian E. Erland	"If you were a child growing up in the fifties like I was you will certainly remember that there were three classic Christmas films that you had to see every holiday season. They were; 'A Christmas Carol' ('51), 'It's A Wonderful Life' ('47) and 'Miracle On 34th Street' ('47).'Miracle On 34th Street' is a charming, magical tale about modern day loss of innocence and joy and how one rotund old man with a white beard revives the ""Spirit of Christmas"" in an increasingly cyncial world. He sees little Susan Walker (Natalie Wood) as his test case. If he can't convince her that he is the real Santa Claus, all is lost.Will he succeed? Can he convince not only Susan, but the entire state of New York? Even more impossible, can he teach Susans' Mother (Maureen O'Hara) to open her heart and trust once again. Anything is possible at Christmast time!Edmund Gwenn is wonderful in the role of Kris Kringle and John Payne serves as the perfect foil and romantic interest for Ms. O'Hara. Director Geroge Seaton and an absolutely wonderful cast give the performances of a lifetime in this Christmas classic that belongs in everyones DVD collection.P.S.: I have to also mention the performance of Marlene Lyden as the Dutch girl who doesn't speak a word of English but wanted to see Santa anyway. This is without a doubt one of the sweetest moments ever put on film."	5.0	"""You're Just A Nice Old Man With A Beard"""	2005-12-16	2	1	1

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A1LDMDMUBJSUN4	Bruce E. Munck	"Let me start by saying that Miracle on 34th Street is one of my favorite Christmas movies: one I have watched many times since my childhood in the 1950's, and one that I am very familiar with. Since many others have reviewed the movie I will restrict my review to the pluses and minuses of the Blu-Ray release in comparison with the standard DVD release.  I have bought this movie in just about every format it has been released: VHS, DVD, DVD Special Edition, and Blu-Ray, and because of this I can make some direct comparisons. My television is a 56"" 1080-P and my player is a Samsung Blu-Ray. I am using the HDMI connector for both DVD and Blu-Ray playback.Resolution and detail: I find it nearly impossible to detect any appreciable difference between the DVD releases and Blu-Ray. The studio did a wonderful job on the DVD's and left little room for improvement in this area. Many of the black and white movies of yester-year were filmed with the focus softened ever so slightly to keep the viewer from noticing and concentrating on details such as skin imperfections, etc., and this effectively limits the amount of detail available at the source. Both releases score high marks here.Picture Crawl: For lack of better terminology I'll use this to give a name to what I see in the DVD releases but not in the Blu-Ray. The picture actually moves side to side and up and down a very small amount while being viewed. This is probably a leftover from the VHS days which was not corrected until now. To see it happening clearly watch the scene where Santa is telling the shop-keeper he made a mistake in placing the reindeer. The picture almost seems to be floating on water as it sways slightly. Watch the same scene on Blu-Ray and the picture is rock-steady. This could have corrected before releasing the DVD edition but was not. I guess the studio wanted an ace-in-the-hole for the time when a new format would be released. In this category Blu-Ray is the clear winner.Brightness: Here is one area where the DVD releases really shine. For some reason the Blu-Ray is overly dark and murky while the DVD looks bright and clear. This is a difference that wouldn't be apparent if watching only one of the formats, but having both really points this up. DVD is the winner here.User Restrictions: Blu-Ray coupled with HDMI has an annoying ability to force what the studios want right down the customers' throats and I don't like that. This movie is going to be viewed in 4x3 mode regardless of how the television and Blu-Ray player have been configured. This is not a judgment on which aspect ratio gives a better viewing experience, I'm simply saying the customer ought to have a choice after laying out good money for the flick. No such restriction exists with DVD. You can choose to watch it either way. DVD wins here.Extras: This Blu-Ray release is much like the first DVD release and doesn't have a lot of additional material to watch. For those who wish only to see the movie this is just right; but if you are one who enjoys background information, the DVD Special Edition has much more to offer. Not only does it contain a wealth of extras, but it also includes the original black and white movie, a colorized version, and a made-for-tv mini-movie (inferior in every way to the original, but included). The winner in this category depends on your preferences.In the final analysis you will decide which release you like better based on your own preferences rather than on mine. Despite Blu-Ray's several drawbacks the crawl has been fixed and it may very well be the issue that tips the scales for you. I have always found it rather annoying myself (unfortunately it occurs in most of the older b/w DVD's) and am grateful to see it finally go away. If brightness proves to be a problem for you it can probably be improved through adjustments to your TV controls, but be aware that if you have had your set professionally adjusted you will be undoing all the good that was done. This Blu-Ray release is generally good, but should have gotten the same royal treatment given to the Blu-Ray release of White Christmas."	3.0	The Good, the Bad, and the Blu-Ray ...	2010-12-22	13	11	2

Amazon fails to list the major stars in the film but lists minor characters that most people would not even recognize. When I first read the actors I though it was the wrong film but did remember that JackAlbertson was in the film a brief minute at the Post Office and in 1947 was not a major star or well known.The film is listed on the holder as the colorized version - it is not - thank goodness. But, why didn't Fox include both the colorized version for those who prefer this and the BW version as the soon to be released IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE!The Blu-Ray version is a rip-off. The transfer is not as good as the standard version. The opening scene is so dark. It was actually difficult to get the disc to start. The set up is awakard and difficult to select different choices available.I realy big disappointment!!!

Maureen O'Hara always delivers a 'class-act' performance!My one critique is that on the Instant Video option of the movie it is NOT clearly marked that the film is delivered in black and white. It would be more appropriate for customer selection purposes, to label the film Clearly- - under the title- - instead of in the movie description. This is a film many viewers watch every year as part of their Christmas tradition, so many people will not be reading the movie description (which is where the black-white description is hidden).	5.0	Black and White Film, not clearly identified.	2013-12-10	0	0	0

It's played every December multiple times, but normally in the added color version, which ruins the film for me. It had been a few years since I seen the movie as my VHS version died years ago, but I ended up buying it on DVD, which includes the b&w and the colorized version, along with the 1955 TV-remake. Yes, the movie does gives the message that Santa is real, which may bother some people, but it is a harmless film that has great actors and dialogue.	5.0	A Christmas Classic	2012-12-12	1	1	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A23UB49EG29MVT	Commenter77	This is an interesting and cleverly worked out addition to the Christmas spirit via the movies.  It reflects the general delights of old movies and the quieter, more trusting spirit of the time.  Totally fanciful in theme, like most popular Christmas films, yet conveying its heart message with good effect.  Like any old movie, of any period really, there is always something to pick at if one wishes.  Old movie fans see those things as well, but generally have decided their preference over obvious flaws and detriments of modern films.  They have opted for the way things were more graciously presented, and Christmas movies are no exception.  This was made post-war when there was a need for regaining faith and hope, along with grace and beauty in everyday life.  People were receptive then and still appreciate it now.  It's always a treat to see different times gone by, men standing up when a lady comes into the room, people wearing dress clothes as a standard in businesses and courtrooms.  It also presents powerful heads of business as well as those leading the legal arena cherishing the same family connections as the rest of us.  The plot and other features are already noted here. Just hurrah for old Hollywood, despite its flaws, especially at Christmastime.	4.0	Seeing Is Not Believing	2012-12-10	1	1	0

Rauen	"This DVD does include both the b/w and colorized versions of Miracle on 34th Street, both of which have been restored and look fantastic.  I know there are a number of ""movie purists"" out there who would scold me for this, but I actually enjoyed the colorized version of this, as I remember seeing this version in the late 1980's on TV;  the process really brings the film to life and, at least to me, does not look artificial in any way.  Includes a wonderful commentary by Maureen O'Hara who fondly remembers the film & fellow actors (most of whom have passed away) with great detail.  This 1947 classic is the definitive version of the story (check out the 70's and 90's versions later, if you must) and is too good to be enjoyed only at Christmas.

Watch this one over and over.  Gwenn is incomparable as Kris Kringle.  And who can compare with Maureen O'Hara as the self-made woman who is really a little girl who grew up too fast.  What a treasure to have Natalie Wood's performance captured for posterity.  Gene Lockhart and William Frawley give classic performances as well.  And don't miss a cameo by Thelma Ritter as the greatful mother.  Sure it's cheesy in spots, over-the-top even, but IT WORKS!!!

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A1F9I8GTSI1VVW	Darcy	Why I choses this rating is basically once a year the tv industry would play this movie.  I would curl up with a bowl of popcorn when living in Wisconsin and watch this show.  Each time it seemed like it was a new movie and never seen before because of the month of the year it was televised once a year.  The holiday Spirit and emotion was attached to this movie.  I truly believed in what the movie was conveying.  It is how I treated my life up to now.  Whenever I did sales in retail I did exactly what Santa had done in this movie and that's how I became a top performer.	5.0	Miracle on 34th Street	2013-05-15	0	0	0
6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A1HX00DL0SZM1G	"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer"""	"It's not until you are well and truly wading through the wealth of special features on the 2-disc special edition DVD of the 1947 Christmas favorite ""The Miracle on 34th Street"" that one realizes that the release features not just two versions of the movie, but three.For not only does the release feature the original black & white version shown in theaters and the circa 1980s colorized version of the same feature film, but also hidden away on the second disc is the curiously titled ""20th Century Fox Hour of the Stars: The Miracle on 34th Street,"" which turns out to be a 46 minute 1950s remake for television that is surprisingly in incredibly good quality.The inclusion of this feature is indicative of Fox's loving tribute to this family movie gem that is this 2-disc release. Prior to its release the studio had no idea how to market what it considered to be an ""unimportant program picture"" and stuck it in the middle of its summer schedule with a trailer (shown here as a 5-minute promotional short) that did not feature one single clip from the movie and went at lengths to conceal it's Yuletide theme.The story is so well known that it hardly bears relating in this review. Suffice to say that it charts the efforts of a man (played in an Academy Award winning performance by British actor Edmund Gwenn) to be legally recognized as Santa Claus, which in fact he is and to persuade a doubting young girl (played by Natalie Wood in a star-turning performance) and a practical realist (played by Maureen O'Hara) that he is indeed Father Christmas. Picked to replace a liquor induced Santa as the Macy's Parade Santa he is a smashing success and indeed Gwenn's performance is so incredible that Natalie Wood really did believe that she was acting opposite Santa Claus.Perhaps the best special feature in this release (in what is a tough choice given its incredible company) is the feature length audio commentary by Maureen O'Hara. Recorded at her home in Ireland this past August the DVD warns us that this is merely excerpts of that interview with frequent silent sections. But I must say that this is happily not entirely accurate. O'Hara is clearly watching the movie (discussing elements on the screen as they occur), but also is more talkative than other commentaries that I have listened to that do not have a similar warning.In the commentary O'Hara recounts being forced to remain in the United States following the outbreak of hostilities in World War II and subsequently furious when (after being allowed to return to her native Ireland) on being ordered back to the U.S. to make this film. She tells us that other considered titles were ""The Big Heart"" and ""It's Only Human"" and how once she read the script she was determined to be involved in what she saw as a warm and affectionate movie. O'Hara also talks about the parade itself and reveals that it was the actual parade with people in the crowd not being aware that Fox was shooting a movie that day.Also included in this release is the 22-minute ""AMC Backstory"" that takes us behind the scenes of the production. Including are on-camera interviews with film historian Rudy Behlmer, actress Maureen O'Hara, actor Robert Hyatt (who played Thomas Mara Jr.), actor Alvin Greenman (who played Alfred), Natalie Wood biographer Suzanne Finstad and Natalie's sister Lana Wood. The documentary traces the genesis to the movie back to a fateful trip to a Los Angeles department store by screenwriter Valentine Davies. Fighting through holiday shoppers on 1944's Christmas Eve in an effort to buy a gift for his wife, Davies wondered what Santa Claus would make of the commercialism of Christmas. After working on the screenplay for over a year the project was optioned by Fox, who evidently had no idea what they had.In what was a huge risk the filmmakers agreed when Macy's and rival store Gimble Bros. said they would withold permission for their names to be used in the film until they had seen the finished film. Thankfully they loved it for if either store had objected Fox would have had to drastically re-cut and re-shoot major portions of the movie.So it was that at the height of the 1946 shopping season over 100 cast and crew descended on the Macy's store in New York City to shoot interiors of the movie and when it wrapped used the likes of Rex Harrison and Anne Baxter (who were on the Fox lot shooting other pictures) to rave about the production. Fox need not have worried though because it was a critical and commercial success staying in theaters for over six months and taking home three of its nominated four Oscars. In fact its popularity is such that it has not only been remade in the included 1950s TV production, but again in a 1970s TV movie and then in a 1994 big budget production (and clips from all three are featured in the AMC Backstory).An archival MovieTone News reel (running 1:42) covers those awards presentations and includes the famous quote from a clean shaven Gwenn when receiving his statue, ""Phew. Now I know there is a Santa Claus.""But that's not all this bumper release contains. Also included is a 15:30 featurette on the history of the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade and in particular its pivotal role in the movie. This new documentary features on-camera interviews with Robert M. Grippo (author of a book on the parade) and John W. Straus who worked on the parade for 22 years and coordinated with the studio that the filming of the parade (with their 14 camera's positioned along the route) went off without a hitch.The special features are rounded out with nine posters for the movie.Audio includes English 5.1 Dolby Surround, English mono, French mono and Spanish mono. There are English and Spanish subtitles.NOTE: Amazon in its wisdom has attached this review to a different DVD version of the movie. They have a habit of doing this unfortunately. Please consider the date of this review and the fact it was for a 2-disc release."	5.0	Not one, but three versions of this story on this Special Edition	2006-11-11	512	499	13

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	The message of this film is just timeless almost sixty years on.  I don't think I would allow less than a mature child to view this film not because the issue of Santa Claus' existence is called to question here.  Rather, the sight of adults behaving badly during what should be the most joyous and festive of holidays may be traumatic.  Whether Santa Claus exists is not the real focus here but the cynicism and commercialism of Christmas by those who should know better is.  The message is delivered subtlely by director-scriptwriter George Seaton.  Despite a happy ending this is strong stuff particularly for 1947 when Hollywood served up feel-good entertainment.  Edmund Gwenn, in one of those rare happenstances, was born to play Kris Kringle.  His mirth and good humor just envelope the screen.  Young Natalie Wood is a joy as young Susan, a child discouraged from believing in the fanciful.  Wood is just so natural and unaffected on the screen.  Amusing bit part here by Jack Albertson as a postal employee.	5.0	Anyone Who Dislikes This Film Gets Coal in Their Stocking	2005-11-26	2	1	1

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A1FDW1SPYKB354	David Von Pein	"1947's ""Miracle On 34th Street"", starring the great Maureen O'Hara and Edmund Gwenn, is a motion picture that can be watched over and over again without losing one bit of its original flavor.  And its flavor is quite tasty, in my opinion!A very spunky 8-year-old Natalie Wood helps to make this movie an even bigger treat.  Natalie shows an acting talent in this film that belies her tender age. She gives one of the best performances by a child actor in a film I've ever come across.  ""34th Street"" was Natalie's 4th screen appearance, in a successful career that would eventually span 52 films before her sudden and tragic death at the age of only 43.Miss Wood seems well-suited for her good-sized role as ""Susan Walker"" in this movie. She blends perfectly with the other actors, and her scenes with Gwenn (who, of course, plays the part of ""Kris Kringle"" to utter perfection) are highly memorable.Could the studio have possibly found a better choice for the part of ""Kris"" (Santa) in this motion picture?  Well, perhaps.  But ONLY if the REAL Santa Claus were to have taken a break from his duties at the North Poll and played the part himself.  Oh...wait...Gwenn turns out to BE the REAL Santa, doesn't he? LOL! :)Yes, Edmund Gwenn actually DOES become ""Santa Claus"" for the 97-minute running time of this movie. He's *that* believable in the role. Gwenn was so good here that he won an Oscar for his memorable performance (Best Supporting Actor).This is a perfect movie to show your children. It must be a lot of fun watching a child's reaction to seeing Mr. Gwenn's very realistic portrayal of the portly fur-clad Christmas-time gift-giver. To a child that still does believe that Mr. Claus visits his or her house every December 24, this movie must be quite an eye-opener.This 20th-Century Fox DVD version of ""Miracle On 34th Street"" brings us the film in its intended (original) screen ratio of 1.33:1 (Full Frame); and the picture looks just dandy!  The film, which was shot in ""glorious black-and-white"", exhibits outstanding clarity on this DVD. I can't spot a bit of grain or ""noise"". An absolutely beautiful digital transfer. Especially considering the age of this flick.The audio comes via an English Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono soundtrack. The audio comes across nice and clean, with just a small amount of background ""hiss"" present. There's also a foreign-language track here, too (French). This French track (which is also 2.0 DD Mono) sounds a bit on the ""muffled"" side. Not nearly as clear-sounding as the English track.  There are subtitles in English and Spanish.There's not a whole lot to talk about in the way of ""Special Features"" for this DVD release. But there is the Original Theatrical Trailer and a short ""TV Spot"" advertising the movie (which is a bonus *not* shown on the DVD's packaging).  Plus: there's also a small text-only area on the disc, featuring ""Cast Credits"".I *must* say, however, even though we don't get many bonus extras with this title, I'm very pleased that the Trailer is included.  This Theatrical Trailer is one of the very best, and most innovative, I think I've ever witnessed. It's a relatively-lengthy trailer, which features a studio executive bumping into multiple actors while on the FOX movie lot. He asks several of these actors what they thought of the just-released picture, ""Miracle On 34th Street"". And what he receives in return (naturally) are glowing reviews for the film.It's a very well-done trailer, and doesn't seem overly ""hokey"" or staged. And it's very fun to see stars the likes of Rex Harrison and Anne Baxter pop up here, promoting ""34th Street"".  Harrison even speaks briefly in this trailer of his then-current work on ""The Ghost And Mrs. Muir"", which, ironically, also featured young Miss Natalie Wood as one of Rex's co-stars.  This trailer is a real treat. And it's in remarkably good shape too. Very good video quality. The audio for the trailer is in DD 2.0 Mono, and sounds just fine.Menus .... I like a good (and simple) Menu design.  And this disc has just that. The Main Menu is a ""static"" one, with separate links to other Sub-Menus (such as Language Selection, Chapter Listing, and Supplements). When you select any of these three items, you'll be treated to a very short (but fun and well-designed) animated transition, which then dissolves into the chosen sub-menu screen.  These short ""transitions"" are all slightly different, with each one featuring a Christmas tune playing as ""background"" music as the screen fades from the Main Menu to your desired selection.  This themed music seems as though it's being played over a Department Store's P.A. system (which is appropriate for this DVD, since we often hear the soft playing of Christmas tunes during the ""Macy's"" scenes in the film). One menu transition also features a ""snowflakes falling"" visual effect, along with the music. Very cleverly done, IMO.Additional Disc Information for this title ..............................>> Enclosures? .... Yes. There is one here. A one-page Chapter List insert is included (21 chapters), with an excellent promo picture of actors Maureen O'Hara, Natalie Wood, and John Payne on one side; and on the ""Chapter"" side, an image of ""Kris"" (Mr. Gwenn).  I particularly like the fact that FOX Home Entertainment used a different picture for the insert than what we see on the front cover (normally on DVDs, the two pictures are identical).  I might also add, in case one or two picky people might be interested in such trivial matters, that this insert is made out of better-quality (thicker) paper than what we usually see for such paper enclosures.>> Region? .... This is a ""Region 1"" (NTSC) disc. Single-sided.----------""Miracle On 34th Street"" is one of those films that deserves to be seen more than once, and not only in the month of December either (IMO).  It holds up very well even in the summer months.  And this clear-as-a-bell DVD from FOX Home Entertainment makes viewing this 1947 classic an even more enjoyable experience -- no matter if it's in December, March, or August."	5.0	This Perennial Classic Shines Like New On DVD!	2004-05-08	18	18	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A325ABGKKA1SQL	Dennis  N Eddlemon	It hardly seems necessary to write a review on &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; because it's hard to believe that anyone hasn't already seen the movie. I'm 57 and I'll bet I've seen &quot;Miracle&quot; 50 times. Every year somewhere between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve I watch it again and every year I laugh in the same places, somehow surprised over and over even though I know most of the dialogue by heart. I also develop a few little tears here and there, also at the same scenes year after year. And every year I find some new little detail that I've missed.Well, perhaps I'm a little too sympathetic having been born on Christmas, but I can't imagine what Christmas was like before &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;. It is a thoroughly delightful movie that could not be improved on by the two remakes since its production in 1947.Add it to your Christmas collection.	5.0	50 Times and Counting	2003-11-27	2	2	0

This kiss takes place in the final scene, just as the picture ends.It is between Maureen O'Hara and John Payne.The first time I saw the movie, when I saw this kiss, I was startled at the way the kiss was acted out. It was to harsh and without finesse, and lacked any romantic appeal for this type of movie. He pressed her mouth so hard, it made lines on the side of her face. It certainly was not the type of kiss that matched this type of movie.	5.0	Great Movie, Worst Screen Kiss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2012-02-09	3	0	3

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A1IJUUNPU7L6LA	"Don ""On The Upper Cumberland"""	I love this movie.  The acting is so very good,...and the emotions brought out are many.  The story line is, of course, simple.... a man who claims to be Kris Kringle... Santa.  This movie was made a long time ago, before 'political correctness' of the ignorant and character-less world of today evolved to what it is.  Had the movie been made today, Kris would have had to take the verbal abuse of the idiot 'psychiatrist' working at the major departments store, and Kris would have been relegated back to the 'home' from which he came.  And the judge would never have allowed the issue involving 'Santa' come to court.	5.0	This Is The Original..... and Awesome!	2013-05-05	0	0	0
6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A1LF84ED2L4MXB	Doreen Appleton	"Miracle on 34th Street is a classic not only because of the attractive characters, the fantasy ending, the humor, but also because of certain structural subtleties which are not noticed by the casual viewer.The movie consists of a series of threats to Kris Kringle and a series of events which neutralize those threats.In the first place, once hired as Macy's Santa, Kris starts sending customers to other stores. When Thelma Ritter (perfectly cast) tells him he shouldn't have promised her son a fire engine (""Macy's hasn't got 'em, nobody's got 'em"") Kris replies, ""You don't think I would have promised the boy unless I was sure, do you? You can get those fire engines at Schoenfeld's, an excellent bargain.""Mr. Schellhammer, the manager of the toy department, overhears this and is horrified. He is on the point of firing Kris when Thelma Ritter walks up to him and congratulates Macy's on ""this wonderful new stunt you're pullin'."" So Schellhammer has to think twice about firing Kris.Meanwhile Mr. Gailey (who will eventually be Kris's attorney) takes Maureen O'Hara's daughter Susie to see Kris. When Susie overhears Kris speaking Dutch to a little Dutch girl, her skepticism (inculcated in her by her cynical mother) is challenged. Doris responds to this by firing Kris.No sooner has this happened than Schellhammer tells Doris about Kris sending customers to other stores. Mr. Macy is excited about the idea, so they both have to un-fire Kris.So much for the first threat to Kris.The second threat comes when Mr. Sawyer, Macy's psychologist, takes a dislike to Kris and tells Doris he has to be fired. But this threat is neutralized by the doctor from the old people's home on Long Island who comes into Doris's office and says Sawyer is exaggerating, Kris ""only wants to be friendly and helpful."" Despite Sawyer's snide denial of this, Kris remains as Santa and even engineers a handshake between Macy and Gimble.At this point we might think that Kris is free and clear, there are no more conflicts. But the movie would be boring without the third and most dramatic conflict.When Kris finds out that Sawyer is psychoanalyzing Alfred, the innocent boy who pushes a broom at Macy's and likes to play Santa Claus, Kris hits Sawyer on the head with his cane. Sawyer pretends the injury is serious and gets Kris committed to Belleview.This sets up the climax of the movie. Gailey tells the judge (Gene Lockhart) that he intends to prove that Kris IS Santa Claus.The judge would throw the case out, but William Frawley (perfectly cast as his political adviser) says, ""You go ahead and rule there's no Santy Claus. Wait til the candy companies, the Christmas tree companies, the toy companies hear about this. You're gonna be an awful popular fellow.""The judge sees the problem, and rules that the belief in Santa Claus is open to debate, a matter of opinion. ""I will hear arguments on both sides.""The District Attorney rests his case after asking Kris, ""Do you really believe you're Santa Claus?"" and Kris answers ""Of course.""Now it is up to Gailey to prove that Kris is the one and only Santa Claus. This he cannot do. The Mayor, the Governor, refuse to put in writing that Kris is Santa Claus.In a touching moment Gailey puts Mr. Macy on the stand. ""Do you believe this man is Santa Claus?"" Macy ponders. He sees newspaper headlines saying ""MACY ADMITS HIS SANTA IS A FRAUD."" Then he see the happy faces of the children whose lives Kris has touched, and humbly says ""I do."" Applause in the courtroom.Now for the tour de force of the movie. Gailey is stuck. No person in authority will publicly say Kris is Santa.We cut to Susie writing a letter to Kris addressed to the courthouse. ""I hope you are not sad. I believe you really are Santa Claus."" Doris appends to the letter, ""I believe in you too.""The letter arrives at the post office, where Jack Albertson suddenly gets the idea of sending all the letters written by Santa to the courthouse. Gailey introduces the letters as proof that a government agency certifies that Kris is Santa Claus. The judge, relieved to be off the hot seat (and the multiple shots of Bill Frawley pointing his cigar at the judge, now warningly, now approvingly, are hilarious), rules, ""If the U.S. Post Office says Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus, this court will not dispute it.""The letter from Susie is overdetermined in two ways: first, its content goes to the cynicism she has learned from her mother, which Kris has now overcome. Secondly, the letter sets up the happy ending.So MIRACLE is one of the most intricately structured movies ever made, along with perhaps THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. Every scene is overdetermined, with meanings reaching down to the thematic depths of the story while driving the action forward.A great example of film structure at its best."	5.0	Structure	2010-12-30	1	0	1

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A30J7WQV0ZNRXG	"D. Reinstein ""marindavid"""	"An Explanation of the ""Everyman"" reference by way of introduction:The morality play Everyman (c.1495-1518), is a Medieval telling of a simple tale casted by actors representing various human attributes, and failings.  The cast includes such characters as ""Everyman"" as well as various human characteristics with whom this representative human must interact. They include, for examples.  ""Death,"" ""Knowledge,"" ""Lusty Wenches,"" and ""Goods.""  It is NOT a comedy!  The characters are not carefully drawn individual humans, as we have come to expect in `good' films and plays, but rather they are human personifications - representing in each character, a singular aspect of the human condition.  Almost like casting a show with the various pieces of a single person to watch them interact - an idea which has probably already been accomplished - likely, off Broadway.  If not, someone ought to give it a thought.On To The Review and Commentary:In any event, ""Miracle on 34th Street"" is such a story.  Yes, there are characters played by real actors.  Some of them, quite good, including the well known and accomplished character actor who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for this piece of performance work in 1947, Edmund Gwenn as ""Kris Kringle"", the old fellow who really believes himself to be `the one-and-only Santa Claus""; John Payne as the attorney who proves that to be true in a New York City/State court; Natalie Wood as the little girl who has learned cold, hard skepticism and concreteness from her wounded and frightened mother - portrayed nicely by Maureen O'Hara.  But while there are many other characters in the film, they are, in this context, less important than the human qualities and flaws and potentials that they represent.  Seen in this way, ""Miracle on 34th Street"" is a Morality Tale for All Times - especially for our own.For those of you who may remain, nearly 60 years after its production and release, unfamiliar with the basic story, I shall briefly summarize it for you:  The famous Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade - the official opening (in 1946-47) of the Christmas season of selling and celebration in New York, is the responsibility of Susan's (Natalie Wood) mother Doris (Maureen O'Hara.) Susan is a single parent having suffered a failed romance and marriage with who she had thought was ""Prince Charming"" but who turned out to be someone far less desirable. She is concrete, skeptical, businesslike and appropriate, yet curt and painfully devoid of any fantasies or dreams.  These deficiencies are deliberately taught to her daughter, who shares her complete lack of faith, hope and trust - also, they are equally devoid of imagination.On this one special Thanksgiving morning, the parade's Santa shows up intoxicated and needs to be replaced. PRESTO!  Kris Kringle appears, dons the costume and performs miraculously well! Everyone is happy.  The problems begin to develop when ""Big Greed #1"" (in the character of store owner Wm. H. Macy) hires him to be the store Santa - thinking it likely that his jovial and lovable presence will increase the Toy Department's sales. Before too long, everyone realizes that old Kris really believes himself to be Santa Claus, and all heck breaks loose.  Of course, as a `romantic comedy' made in 1947, everything resolves beautifully - the good get regarded and the bad get their just deserts. In between, however, an important metaphoric staging of the human condition and many of its (our) basic dilemmas are played out by actors representing, as in Everyman, basic human characteristics.For example: Kris Kringle (Santa):  Goodness, unqualified love, hope and trust. Susan (The little girl): The reality of youth's struggle with reality vs. imagination and faith. Doris (Susan's Mom):  Hurt and disappointment. Mr. Gayly (The attorney): The converted hero who proves faith to be warranted. Mr. Sawyer (The store psychologist): Envy, pettiness and cruelty. Arnold (Assistant Janitor): Youth's better inclinations, vulnerable though they are. Mr. Macy:  Big Greed #1. Mr. Gimble: Big Greed #2. Mr. Shelhammer (Toy department Manager): Little Greed #1. There are many other characters portraying many other aspects of who and what we are - have been - or might yet become.I could go on and on - but I think the essence of my point is clear.In the interaction of these people/characters/aspects of humanity - a wonderful story is played out for us. A story filled with inspiration and thought-provoking light moments.The plot is slight, the sentiments unarguable sappy and the black and white photography is lovely.  I urge you to 1) Rent or buy this film and watch it (without the televisions nuisance commercial interruptions) sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas together with your entire family.  It is a far better, less violently and anguishing film to watch than the much touted ""It's A Wonderful Life; and 2) Avoid wasting you time on any of the several remakes (two on film and one for TV) of this film.  They got it right the first time - also it is worth avoiding the `colorized' version as the addition of a color pallet actually detracts from the magnificent simplicity of the tale itself.I actually watch this movie every year - it helps to get me into the `spirit' of the holidays as they might have once been and, given the good efforts of good people, might once again become. It's 97 minutes you won't regret spending in front of your TV.This particular special ""50th Anniversary Edition"" has been Digitally Remastered yielding a MUCH better resolution that even the original 35mm film, and it also includes some wonderful extras including a string of original `Trailers' shown in theatres prior to its release in 1947.  Some of the unexpected cameos in these trailers - as well as the theme of them - are best left unrevealed by me.  The surprises in them actually add to the wonder of the film itself.Don't miss this one!

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A3FHSLWEMH7JD8	"Elizabeth G. Melillo ""gloriana"""	The &quot;dreams come true at Christmas&quot; (especially at Macy's...) premise of this film could have become syrupy sweet had it not had the brilliantly skillful handling that makes this a fun classic. Much of the dialogue (handled, of course, by top actors) is wryly hilarious. Scenes I particularly enjoy are the conversations between Kris and Alfred (&quot;make a buck, make a buck!&quot;), anyone's chats with the young but wise Susie, and the wonderful Bill Frawley's reminding a judge that, especially with elections forthcoming, declaring there is no Santa Claus could have devastating consequences. The scene of Kris's trial (where the &quot;allegedly mentally ill&quot; old man so clearly has far more good sense than those around him) is brilliant.The acting is marvellous - no one, including Kris, is a caricature, other than the self-proclaimed &quot;psychiatrist&quot; who takes a swipe at Santa. The balance between &quot;playing the characters straight&quot; and actually quite sophisticated humour is extraordinary.The key for the viewer, of course, is to remember that Kris indeed is Santa Claus. The setting, where two major department stores unwittingly end up fighting for a greater image of detached good will, is social commentary, albeit of a very different sort, which Dickens would envy.	5.0	Very clever humour!	2001-10-31	8	7	1

Hopson ""StarWatcher"""	"""Miracle on 34th Street"" opens with a wonderful holiday feel to it, as the camera follows an elderly gentleman down the sidewalk of a busy Christmas holiday New York street. The scene develops into the Macy's Department Store Thanksgiving Day parade, with the elderly man discovering that the man that Macy's has hired to portray Santa is disgracefully drunk!  Doris Walker, (Maureen O'Hara) who is Macy's special events director, persuades the elderly man to take his place, telling him how much that he looks like the ""real' Santa! The elderly man proves to be a sensation and is quickly recruited to be the store Santa at the Macy's department store!  While he is successful, Ms. Walker learns that he calls himself Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn) and he claims to be the actual Santa Claus! Despite reassurances by Kringle's doctor that he is harmless, Doris still has misgivings, especially when she has cynically trained herself, and also her young daughter, Susan, (Natalie Wood) to reject all notions of belief and fantasy. And yet, people, especially Susan, begin to notice there is something special about Kris and his determination to advance the true spirit of Christmas amidst the rampant commercialism around him and succeeding in improbable ways. Kris even brings together department store rivals Macy and Gimbal! When a raucous conflict with the store's cruelly incompetent psychologist erupts; Kris finds himself held at Bellevue where, in despair, he deliberately fails a mental examination to ensure his commitment. All seems lost until Doris' lawyer friend, Fred Gaily, (John Payne) reassure Kris of his worth and agrees to represent him in the fight to secure his release. To achieve that, Fred arranges a formal hearing in which he argues that Kris is sane because he is in fact the real and genuine Santa Claus!  What ensues is an incredibly entertaining hearing in which people's beliefs are reexamined and put to the test, but even so, it's going to take a miracle for Kris to win!""Miracle on 34th Street"" (1947) has got to be one of the best and original Christmas stories ever made! You'll delight at the scene of Susan watching skeptically as Santa is talking to the children in the department store, and he talks to both the French children and a special little Dutch girl, who he also sings a song to! Susan is amazed that this man knows so much about children and even speaks different languages! The movie's finale is what makes this movie such a wonderful Christmas experience! To see an ordinary lawyer like Fred Gaily represent a seemingly ordinary man like Kris Kringle and in a brilliant moment Fred uses a government service to prove that, not only is this pleasant little man Kris Kringle, but the one and only Santa Claus! And it's all played out on Christmas Eve! You would think that after this scene that the movie would end- not so! Another wonderful scene awaits, and will have you saying, along with Susan, Doris, and Fred- ""He REALLY is Santa Claus!!"""	5.0	"""Miracle on 34th Street""  1947 Version Still The Best!"	2007-11-14	0	0	0

Edmund Gwenn IS Santa Claus in his Academy Award-winning performance, and Natalie Wood belies the oft-repeated criticism of the overly-acted, under-performing ""child actor,"" by delivering a performance that is at once as believable as it is tender.-----One performance to especially watch for: Gene Lockhart as Judge Harper; he is absolutely hilarious as a jurist of the Supreme Court of New York, worried about his reelection chances if he rules that Santa doesn't exist. William Frawley, as Harper's political guru is also especially effective.---- The depiction of the baser side of humanity takes the form of corporate greed, cynicism (on the part of Doris) and disbelief (Susan), and the mean-spirited smallness of a nasty little man (Macy's store ""psychologist""). In addition, greed is frequently depicted among characters (Doris and the Toy Department Manager worry about losing their bonuses if they fire an apparently insane Santa---says the manager to Doris: ""Maybe he's just a LITTLE bit crazy---like painters, composers, and some of those guys in Washington..."").--- One of my favorite scenes is when a young Dutch orphan meets Kris (Santa) with her adopted mother. The mother explains to Kris that the girl was just adopted from Rotterdam, and that she doesn't speak any English. What follows is a darling scence where Kris speaks to the child in Dutch, and sings ""Santa Claus"" with her in the same language-----What modern audiences wouldn't know---but audiences in 1947 would--- is that Rotterdam was the site of one of the Nazis most infamous and horrendous blitzkriegs, which focused particularly brutally on civilian housing. The number of children and women killed in that city was appalling, and represented the highest fatality rate of children of any Nazi bombing raid during the entire war----the number of orphans left in Holland afterwards was very large, thus, this scene provides an additional emotional punch as audiences would realize the child was a survivor of a blitzkrieg.--- The very fact that this movie remains not only relevant, but only seems to increase in popularity, some 65 years after it was first premiered, speaks to its timeless element. I do believe that if Macy's Thanksgiving Day parades, and visits to Santa at the Mall were passe, modern audiences would probably have a more difficult time relating to the film, despite the timelessness of its subject. But the fact that our traditions have remained largely unchanged---most particularly in regards to how we, as a society, try to protect the imaginations of our children---the film still resonates. Even 65 years later, audiences still feel an unease when confronted with a small child's disbelief in anything magical and her very adult cynicism towards life in general....--- Miracle on 34th Street does not represent ""great art"" or a larger-than-life subject matter, but it does represent something far more precious: the enduring human need of faith, and the bounty one reaps from small acts of kindness."	5.0	THE Christmas movie	2013-04-15	0	0	0
6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A2RIOXD8PR83B8	G. Baker	Beside the fact that this is a total classic must-watch movie, this story is an original with great actors and great subtle humor. Natalie Wood is so cute, and does such a great job! Also, I love seeing how life was back in the day... ie; we laugh about how huge the newspapers used to be, how much the times have changed the way everyone used to dress up for everyday living... just realizing how much we've changed (for the better, and the worse).The other thing that makes this movie my favorite is that the lawyer's son is my brother, Bobby Hyatt. He is so cute. He has since passed, in 2007.Here is a clip from his teen years. He is the brother of Natalie Wood in a TV series from the 50's. Love it![...]	5.0	A Classic Must Watch - Every year!	2013-12-11	0	0	0
6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A1IT9VY8Z9RG92	"G. D. Williams ""gareth37"""	"20th Century Fox's 1947 Miracle on 34th Street has become a staple for the holiday season.  It has a warm charm to its mystical allure.As everyone knows, it's a story of belief.  A single mother, Doris Walker, is raising her 8-year old daughter, Susan, without the assistance of make-believe or her former husband.Along comes an old man with a glint in his eyes for the miracle of Christmas.  He audaciously declares that he is Kris Kringle, the original who just happens to work in Macy's Department Store as Santa Claus.Mr. Kringle has come to New York City to confront the commercialization of Christmas. As he states to Doris Walker:""For the past 50 years or so I've been getting more and more worried about Christmas. Seems we're all so busy trying to beat the other fellow in making things go faster and look shinier and cost less that Christmas and I are sort of getting lost in the shuffle.""Of course, she finds him amusing until her daughter begins to believe that he is the real thing. Toss in the store psychologist with a Scrooge demeanor and you have a story which plays out in a courtroom. The judge wishes he had never gotten this case on his docket, with an ambitious district attorney who wants to make a name for himself.It has a great cast. A historical note: it was released to the public on May 2, 1947 because Darryl F. Zanuck, studio head, believed the ticket sales would be better in Summer than late Fall and Winter. He had grave reservations about the film. The original trailer in the winter of 1947 was vague about what the film actually was.It was nominated for best picture.  It won Oscars for best supporting actor, screenplay and original story.""Faith is believing when common sense tells you not to. Don't you see? It's not just Kris that's on trial, it's everything he stands for. It's kindness and joy and love and all the other intangibles."""	5.0	Miracle on 34th Street (Special Edition)	2010-11-24	2	1	1

Even says on the back description that its in the new colorized Blu-Ray. They do have the movie in a two disc format B&W and colorized version DVD which was $2.00 cheaper, but I wanted the movie in Blu-Ray. Don't understand why they would even make a movie that's B&W in a Blu-Ray version. Out come of all this is that I wrote Amazon and they refunded my money and was able to keep the movie. Very nice of them. Amazon is the first place I look if I want to buy something.	5.0	Miracle on 34th Street	2013-01-01	1	1	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A2E6O39WQPAX8E	Grateful Dad	"This a wonderful movie about love and faith and belief in good things.  We watched it with my almost 10 year old who has ""almost"" concluded that Santa Clause is really someone other than the guy from the North Pole.  This movie helps one ""believe"" in Santa a little longer, even though one may already be convinced otherwise.  I a friend of mine told me when his (now adult) daughter asked if Santa was real, his answer was, ""If you 'believe' in Santa, he will continue to bring you stuff.  If you don't believe in Santa, he won't.""  She continued to believe in Santa for a long time afterwards.  I will NEVER admit to my daugther that Santa does not exist, only that if she believes in him, he will be there for her.  This movie touches on that belief.  Is he or isn't he?  This was the right year for my daughter to see this movie for the first time.  For now, she still ""believes"" in Santa and by that I mean, I think she likely knows that Santa Claus is a game we ALL love playing and she still wants to play.  Showing this movie to kids earlier than 4th grade, will introduce the idea of whether Santa Claus is real and I NEVER wanted to go there until I had to.  Enjoy the movie with your older child."	4.0	Not for young kids	2010-12-26	0	0	0

I rented it this year(2004) on a whim and was surprised what an impact it had. Great movie to overcome the cynical times we live in. It actually does remind us what it is all about. Great for New Yorkers to see Manhattan when it was great.

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	AHRQOLXJE4CBV	"JACK LOBO ""ljb926"""	Perfection was struck when they made this movie. Why they even bothered with the awful remakes is beyond the comprehension of even the wisest of people. I'm not going to go into a plot detail. One reviewer described Thomas Mara Jr. getting his oversized football helmut Christmas morning. I tried going to every site possible and can find no mention of that scene. Besides that scene doesn't sound all that monumental. Now if that beautiful, throat lumping, eyes welling up, I hope everyone in the room is watching the movie and not me scene with the little Dutch girl was cut, THAT would be a far better reason to boycott this dvd. But they haven't. It's all there. With all the bonus features this 2 disc version is a must have. If you have the previously released DVD the cute 5 minute trailer is known as (promotional spot) on this set. Disc 2. There's a nicety to having both the colorized and original Black & White versions. I'm comfortable watching either one. I am amazed and disgusted as I find a growing number of morons oops! (I mean people) who flat out refuse to watch anything that's in Black & White. No matter how good it is. I suffered through the 1997 remake with my then wife who totally refused to watch this version simply because it was in B&W. The color version looks a little drab. A little adjustment of the tint and color settings from your TV may be necessary for the best possible picture. I know alot of people are upset because a classic B&W movie has been tampered with. Chances are, maybe the filmakers wanted to film this in color, but Fox studio exec Darryl F Zanuck did not grant a large enough budget. After all this is a Christmas movie. Who wouldn't want to display all the wonderous colors of Christmas. If this dvd was offered as a colorized version only, I would still buy it. Why? Because I could always turn the color completely off on my TV and instantly have the classic B&W version. I dread the thought of movies being colorized just to draw in knuckleheads who didn't have the respect for the classic films in the first place. Yet I'm curious as to what would something like Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein look like in color. Wow! Sorry about the tangent. This is a great movie colorized or not.	5.0	THE ONLY VERSION WORTH OWNING.	2007-11-11	4	3	1

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A1345VRK5MYG7	James L.	Oddly enough, I never saw this film as a child and was an adult for the first viewing.  Cynically, I didn't expect to enjoy it much.  So much for cynicism - the magic of the film and its message got to me.  And it still does every time I watch it.  Edmund Gwenn is excellent as Kris Kringle, the man who is a dead ringer for Santa Claus because he IS Santa Claus.  Natalie Wood is the young girl (a cynic herself) who doesn't believe in him, having been taught by her mother, Maureen O'Hara, to be very realistic and practical.  Not only was Wood a great adult actress, but she was also a gifted child star, delivering lines and emotions like a pro.  Thelma Ritter has a small bit as a frustrated shopper, but she's a standout, as is the rest of the supporting cast.  This film reminds you of the joy and magic that every Christmas should bring, whether you're an adult or a child.	5.0	No Room For Cynics	2000-11-18	7	6	1

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	ATXBVX2B2PBHF	Jan	Every Christmas our familty used to put our Christmas tree up and watch this movie at the same time. It was a family tradition. This Christmas this movie wasn't on any of the channels so I downloaded it from Amazon and we put the tree up. The screen is really little so we had to do a lot of stopping to watch the most important parts but at least we got to see it as a family. I feel really bad that the traditional Christmas shows have been completely disregarded this year for crap or that you have to pay to watch them. Christmas is about giving-it seems these new fancy channels want you to pay for everything. That's to bad, this movie is really special and a lot of the kids growing up will never get to see it and feel that warmth of family while they're watching.	5.0	-----------------------------------------------------Family Christmas movie+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++	2013-12-28	0	0	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A3Q04XXGGED746	"Jan Peczkis ""Scholar and Thinker"""	"This heartwarming story reminds us that ""common sense"" is not always ""reality"".Common sense tells us that a store Santa at Macy's should push only Macy's products to customers. Otherwise, Macy will be throwing away business. Instead, the new store Santa (Kris Kringle) sometimes refers the customers to a competitor (Gimbels) when the latter has the product that the customer actually wants. The counterintuitive result? Customers appreciate this and Macy's sales go way up.Common sense tells us that a man who is convinced that he is Santa Claus is delusional, and may become violent. The psychologist at Macy's recommends that Kris Kringle be committed into a mental institution. Will common sense prevail?The mother of little Susie, evidently embittered by her divorce, wants to disabuse her daughter of anything like Prince Charming or Santa Claus. Only real things should matter. Little Susie does not even know how to play imaginative games with other children her age. Kris Kringle must teach her how to pretend to be a monkey. Finally, both mother and daughter are forced to reconsider their ""common sense"" attitudes towards Santa Claus.Common sense tells us that there is no Santa Claus, and no court should ever waste its time on this matter. The judge doesn't know what to do. If he rules according to common sense, that there is no Santa Claus, he will commit political suicide. There is no way of canceling the court proceedings, and it is impossible to prove the existence of Santa Claus, much less that old man Kris Kringle is actually Santa Claus. Right?

Zanuck predicted a lukewarm public response when he viewed the film: he distributed it in the  summer of 1947; it was still playing 6 months later when millions of  children were posting letters to Santa!

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A13ZAVU55QK5DW	Jason Knapp	Awkward, formulaic, even leaden at times: there's just something about the sentiment in this movie I can't resist.This isn't a great movie, but it's a good one. The very premise -- standing up to common sense at a time of the year when we want so much to believe in the inherent goodness of people -- can get you right where you live if you're willing to give yourself over to it. Edmund Gwenn and (a very young) Natalie Wood help us to do just that.The rest of the cast is a bit stilted, but it just doesn't matter. Besides, the 90-second screen debut of Thelma Ritter would make any movie a gem. (Naturally, she manages to do in those 90 seconds what most of the cast struggles to do in 90 minutes: make us believe that what we're watching could be real.)

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A2BC978GQQEA2A	Jeffrey Pidgeon	"""Miracle On 34th Street"", written by Valentine Davies and George Seaton; directed by George Seaton. (Spoilers abound, because I can't imagine that anyone who can read this hasn't seen this film yet).It's the classic story of kindly Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn), a Macy's store Santa who firmly believes that he really is Santa Claus. Hard-bitten Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) and her level-headed daughter Susan (Natalie Wood) don't buy it for a second. But is he telling the truth?As long as there's been Christmas (and Christmas movies), filmmakers have struggled to capture that feeling many of us associate with the season. Like many other subject matter, Christmas is a high-wire act, and audiences are more often than not subjected to a dunking in treacle. What is it, then, that makes this film so effective? Why has this story thrived for almost sixty years, surpassing the inevitable remake and imitations with nary a blemish?The obvious answers are true: it's extremely well written, directed and performed. Everyone in the film is tremendous, and naturally Gwenn and Wood are the standouts. It's impossible to imagine anyone being a more convincing Santa than Mr. Gwenn, and young miss Wood's acting is expressive and touching. It's a real challenge to make literal-mindedness and pragmatism appealing, and her success seems effortless.Like many great movies, every choice feels as if there were no other option. Imagine setting this at a store in the midwest. The writer easily could have done so, but by setting it in New York City, the iconic heart of tough-minded me-first cynicism, the sentimentality has fertile ground in which to bloom.That's reflected in the script again and again with a salty, grounded edge to amost every character decision. Parade manager Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) doesn't simply choose Kris because he's kind-hearted and a dead ringer for Santa - she grabs him off the street in desperation because the Santa that she hired is passed-out drunk. It's also echoed in the skepticism of almost everyone that Kris comes across. Everyone likes him, but they're pretty sure he's a bit of a nut. Kris is so good in the parade, though, that he's quickly hired as the flagship Claus for the store.Things are allowed to continue as they are - Kris 'plays' Santa at Macy's - with no one needing to seriously question his identity. Business is booming, and as long as Kris isn't seen to be a danger to anyone, his 'eccentricity' gets a pass. Even a huge potential misstep - Kris begins to recommend products from competing stores to customers - transforms into a goodwill epidemic among the retail chains. Naturally, this balance doesn't last long.Kris make a friend with Alfred, a young janitor who loves playing Santa for the kids, too - but both he and Kris fall victim to the Macy's employee screener, Granville Sawyer (Porter Hall). Literal-minded to a fault, Mr. Sawyer believes that Kris is deranged, and will cause harm if his delusion is threatened. But the straw that breaks the reindeer's back is when Sawyer begins to psychoanalyze Alfred, convincing him that his love of being Santa is the result of a guilt complex in his childhood. This infuriates Kris to such a degree that he clonks the would-be Freud on the head with his cane - and that's all the ammunition that Sawyer needs.He sets in motion commitment proceedings, an action even the hard-boiled Macy doesn't want to take. But it's too late. Fortunately, Santa has a lawyer - Fred Gailey (John Payne), who lives near Doris. While both Fred and Kris have ulterior motives concerning Doris and Susan - Fred wants to get to know Doris better, Kris wants to introduce Susan to imagination and faith - the script does the tricky job of keeping our sympathy.Another great choice is to make Kris' first (literal) defender an adult - another stong contrast to the watery-eyed moppet who believes, believes, believes from the first frame to the last. Additionally, Doris and Susan are the last to make that emotional shift.The stakes are high, too - Kris isn't simply going to be fired and sent packing out into the snow. If this case is lost, he'll be committed to Bellview asylum for good. We get a little taste of how broken and unhappy he'd be when Kris weakens and deliberately fails the psychiatric exam, effectively committing himself. His faith in his fellow man is shattered, but fortunately lawyer Fred Gailey (John Payne) convinces him to keep fighting - deftly setting up the courtroom sequence.Fred take the best path a lawyer could use - he pressures the prosecutor to prove that Kris isn't Santa. No one wants to say there's no Santa on the stand, for a variety of savvy, unsentimental reasons. The prosecutor doesn't want to crush his son's dreams of Christmas. Mr. Macy won't, because he doesn't want to make headlines as the man who planted a fake Santa in his flagship store in the heart of the shopping season. The judge doesn't want to drop the hammer on Kris, either - he wants to run for public office soon, and there's lots of voter alienation hanging in the balance. Eventually, though, the hearing reaches the inevitable - the judge is duty-bound to require concrete proof from the defense. Where could that possibly come from?That proof - delivered when a couple of postal workers send fifty thousand letters to the courthouse, helping Fred prove his case that Kris is the ""one and only"" Santa Claus - is a choice made simply to help clear out the dead letter office. It's a choice that could have been terribly maudlin if both mail workers had melted in light of Kris' plight - but with that opportunistic shade, it's so entertaining that we buy it whole-heartedly. Of course, it's also beautfully set up by having little Susan (Natalie Wood) first write her letter of support when things look darkest.The theme of faith is endlessly reflected in the script. Doris needs to have faith in love (Fred), Susan needs to have faith that Kris will bring her special gift, Kris has faith that Fred will prevail, and everyone, as we know, needs to have faith in Santa Claus."	5.0	Faith And Other Intangibles	2006-12-06	6	5	1
6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A1FIDCH2QQA9E9	JEL	This is a great movie,as many have posted before me. However, after hearing the classic radio show (heard it on Sirius)  originally aired around the same time as the orginal movie release, I learned something entirely new about this old classic I enjoyed for many years. In the classic radio show at the end when the lawyer talks with Santa about the house, he learns that Santa set the entire sanity trial up, Santa knew the lawyer could not afford the house unless he bacame a famous lawyer, and by going to trial it made the lawyer famous. I never realized that Santa set it all up by making them think he was crazy, but it makes sense that Santa could be that smart.	5.0	Classic radio show gave additional insight to movie theme	2004-12-29	5	5	0

So this make me feel young at heart and yes even shed a tear or too. This is definitely worthy of the description ""Christmas Classic."" The storyline and wonderful performances by the tremendous cast create an enchanting tale. Although made in 1947, this film is in no way dated. It shows the commercial aspect that surrounds the holiday season while still managing to demonstrate the magical feeling that Christmas brings.I love its theme and its message: No matter what age you are, you must always be willing to have faith in others and yourself.

Black and white or colorized, you can't go wrong.Edmund Gwenn as Santa is the heart and soul of this movie.  He is as we all imagine (and hope) Santa to be.  It almost hurts when we see the other characters not actually believing he is the one and only Saint Nick.But the other actors and actresses are also top notch...except for Maureen O'Hara.  She may be the nicest lady in the world ... I don't know ... but she almost single-handedly torpedoes this movie.  It achieves classic status despite her.John Payne plays the lawyer (Fred Gaily) and he is excellent ... a nice understated and believable performance.  And Natalie Wood is cute and believable as the little girl who doesn't believe in Santa Claus.  The rest of the cast is, as I said, superb (not counting Ms. O'Hara) ... giving us a collection of unique characters who fill out the movie nicely.One last thing ... the one scene I like (love) best is the one where the little Dutch girl, who can't speak English, comes to sit on Santa's lap.

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A10ODC971MDHV8	John Farr	"Was there ever a better big-screen Santa than Oscar winner Edmund Gwenn? This timeless Christmas fable about an elderly retiree who sets New York a-twitter with his claim to be the sleigh-riding patron saint of the North Pole captures the spirit of the season like few other holiday films. Young Natalie Wood is delightful as the disbelieving girl who, hewing to her mother's urban sophisticate views, thinks the notion of elves and Saint Nick is preposterous. Repeat viewings won't diminish the charming allure or the endearing message of ""Miracle."""	5.0	Miracle on 34th Street	2007-06-25	1	1	0

They came to love it as a Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Tradition and I just found out by way of the very same DVD purchased that a day is set aside for viewing the film in Ireland, very similar to the family tradition I had with my kids when growing up..I highly recommend this DVD set, one Original Black and White and one Colorized for anyone that dislikes black and white, not to mention the different added attractions and information added by interviews, inside information etc.I might add myself that the house used at the end of the film really exists on Long Island's North Shore on what I recall to be ""24 Derby Road"" Port Washington New York. That is in Nassau County North of Northern Boulevard not far from the Queens County/Nassau County border line.It is a nice neighborhood still to this day remains very much as it was then during the movie shoot and note in the DVD extras a lot of detail is added on neighbors and their interactions with the actors, actresses and crew making the movie.It arrived on time, in good condition was everything represented by the vendor and will forever remain a cherished part of my movie collection."	5.0	The Best Movie Out there for Christmas Lovers	2010-12-30	0	0	0

I have found that the older movies are magnificent on Blu ray. Casablanca, Ben Hur, the 10 Commandments etc. are all wonderful, Blu ray brings out the best in films except for Miracle on 34Th Street. I just viewed it and it looks like i was watching a VHS film. It was dark, brownish and not pleasant to watch. I recommend buying the DVD and leaving the Blu ray alone as far as this movie goes.

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A3OH101U0CPUC7	Joseph Boone	Macy's Department Store hires a Santa Claus (Edmund Gwenn) for the toy department and he becomes quite a sensation with customers.  Unfortunately, they soon learn that the man, who goes by the name Kris Kringle, believes he is the actual Santa Claus.  This ends up leading to a commitment hearing where his lawyer, Fred Gailey (John Payne) must prove that Kris is exactly what he claims to be.Miracle on 34th Street is a lighthearted Christmas classic with a message that never goes out of style.  The movie is meant to remind all of us that Christmas is a time of giving and that the real meaning is too easily swamped by commercialism.  Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) and her daughter Susan (Natalie Wood) provide another aspect in that they are hardheaded pragmatists who don't believe in anything tangible.  Kris takes it as a personal challenge to bring a little magic and imagination into their lives.This is an interesting and entertaining movie for many reasons.  First, Santa Claus is often cited as an example of the commercialization of Christmas, but here he acts as its conscience.  Kris represents the best of humanity with his generosity, warmth, and kindness.  The movie may have gone a bit far in demonizing common sense but its heart is in the right place.  The performances are uniformly excellent and in a small role William Frawley (better known as Fred Mertz to Lucy fans) steals the show in all of his scenes.Miracle on 34th Street offers a bit of everything.  It's a comedy that's laugh out loud funny when it tries to be.  It's part schmaltzy Christmas movie and revels in that role, but just manages to avoid drowning in sappiness.  And it remains a very relevant fable about the excesses of modern society including being overly obsessed with materialism at the expense of intangibles that make live really worth living.  If you've never seen it, then give it a try and you just might find your new favorite holiday movie.	5.0	Best of the best	2007-12-24	2	2	0

Every Christmas I look forward to seeing this film, and it is difficult to find this version shown on TV.  The more recent versions of this film do not come close to the charm and cast that is found in the original film.  Did you know that this was Thelma Ritter's first movie?  She was middle aged when she acted in this movie.  She went on to act in a number of movies after this.  It just goes to show you that it is never too late to do something you really want to do.  Now that I have purchased the DVD, I can watch it any time I want to, even when it isn't during Christmas season.  I recommend buying this DVD from Amazon.com.  The price was great, the quality of the DVD is terrific and the shipping was speedy.

Edmund Gwenn's Oscar-winning performance as Kris Kringle is sharp and funny without ever becoming sentimental. Natalie Wood's natural and charming Susan gets to show the all-too-modern skepticism about something as &#34;corny&#34; as the spirit of Christmas. Maureen O'Hara, Susan's mom, gets to deliver a Scrooge-like speech about the foolishness of her lawyer boyfriend's decision to defend Kringle's right to be Santa. His heart-felt desire to defend Kringle's message and delivery of charity, love, and joy seem to Susan's mom to be career suicide for the young lawyer. Guess who wins that battle?

I'll admit it, I'm a complete and total Christmas fanatic and so find very little to complain about, when it comes to classic Christmas films.  Miracle On 34th Street (1947) is an absolute favorite of mine.  I don't think any film captures the innocence of the Christmas season, like this film does.What a cast....Edmund Gwenn, Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Natalie Wood, Gene Lockhart, Thelma Ritter and William Frawley, just to name a few.  Gwenn won an Academy Award for his role as, Kris Kringle and he deserved it!If I was going to show one film to someone not fond of Christmas films, this would probably be the one I'd choose, betting I could make a fan of them with one viewing of this classic.I've bought the VHS, the DVD and the Blu-Ray of this film and have never been disappointed.  I even appreciate the colorized version of the film and that's rare for me.Gather the family and introduce a whole new generation to this classic....I bet it won't be the only time you watch this!	5.0	A Must-See Christmas Classic	2012-11-24	1	1	0

The arrival of Santa at the end of the Macy's parade always brought tears to my eyes. It still does. I am trying to make it a tradition for my grandsons. I love this film, black and white or colorized. My youngest grandson, 8 years old, asked why we were going to watch a gray movie. I explained that color film was not invented when this film was made.

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	AGKPTMTR3UX1R	"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here"""	"Yes, little Susan, there is a Santa Claus . . . and in this movie he's pretending to be the actor Edmund Gwenn just so he can bring a little Christmas joy to the world.Made in the rosy flush of victory after World War II, MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET is a wonderfully optimistic film. Santa's kindliness to a little Dutch refugee girl tugs at the heartstrings. And that is only one of many scenes.Maureen O'Hara (Doris) a divorced single Mom, is coordinator of the venerable Macy*s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Forced to find a last-minute replacement for a snockered St. Nick she hires the real Santa Claus. Of course, nobody really believes that he's the one and only Kris Kringle, but he does, and what's more important, by the end of the movie, so do we.Mr. Kringle has to suffer through the indignity of a committment hearing (which he wins in an ""it-could-only-happen-in-New York City"" manner), but his greatest victory is convincing the cynical Doris and her disbelieving six year old (played by Natalie Wood) that imagination is just another form of reality.This Special Edition has three versions of the film. The original b&w; 1947 version and the colorized 1980 version are packaged with a 1950's edited-for-TV version (which somehow I remember seeing in the early 1960s). Thank heavens it DOES NOT have the more recent remake.No matter what version you decide to watch (I recommend the 1947 original), nothing outshines this happy film."	5.0	"""I believe . . .

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A2XT5OR3AR1PU2	KRA	"This movie is a true American tale. Although the Department Store originated in Europe, American cities, in their heyday, took it to a whole new level. In an era long before Malls, shoppers whether they lived in city, suburb, or country, would travel to their nearest downtown to do their shopping at one of these grand emporiums. It did not matter whether it was Detroit (JL Hudson), Philadelphia (John Wanamaker), Boston (Jordan Marsh), Chicago (Marshal Feild), every city had it's signature store and it was as much an issue of civic pride as the baseball team was. When this movie was released (1947), Manhattan was to home to over one dozen grand department stores.Even small cities had the ""it"" store such as; Hess's in Allentown, Bergner's in Peoria, Pourteous in Portland, and so on.Needless to say these icons really shined at Christmas, and this movie took it's inspiration from two of the most competitive of NYC's grand stores, Gimbels (closed since 1986), and still thriving Macy's. Macy's holds it's famous Thanksgiving Day Parade in NYC (Gimbels was in Philly), and after the original Macy's Santa was found to be celebrating a wee bit too much, Edmund Gwenn steps onto the scene as THE Kris Kringle.Maureen O'Hara plays the haried Macy's Personel Manager (it was not called ""HR"" yet), and she is found to be a bitter divorcee, and single parent (yes, even then people got divorced, and were single parents).  John Payne courts her, and I guess you could say wants to rescue her, and Natalie Wood from their very insular world.However in the middle of all this Macy's Santa winds up sending parents to,  horrors, of horrors,  Gimbels for better skates (and other toys), and for that matter any other store if Macy's does not have it better, or cheaper.  Needless to say Macy's Toy Buyer freaks out big time, and Santa winds up in a court battle over his sanity.It all works out in the end, and if ever there is a time for a good old fashioned Hollywood ending it's Christmas time.A true American tale that can't make you feel anything, but good!"	5.0	Is There a Better Christmas Movie?,  I Don't Think So!	2005-08-29	4	4	0

Bernabo	"Since &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; begins with the Macy's parade on Thanksgiving Day, it is the obvious movie to watch on Turkey Day to begin the Christmas season (when you watch &quot;White Christmas,&quot; &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; and &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; is up to you). I know am not alone in my belief that Edmund Gwenn IS Kris Kringle, which means he IS Santa Claus. Of course they gave Gwenn the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in 1948, but the film also won Oscars for Best Writing, Original Story (Valentine Davies) and Best Writing, Screenplay (George Seaton). Maureen O'Hara plays Doris Walker, a single mom who insists on bringing her daughter Susan, played by adorable Natalie Wood in one of the great childhood performances of all time, in a no-nonsense manner, which means no fantasy, no fairy tales and certainly no Santa Claus. Boy, is she ever wrong.This version of this classic holiday film offers up the long trailer in which the publicity department tries to figure out how to market the film to the masses.  A nice added bonus.  However, the point of owning ""Miracle on 34th Street"" is to be able to watch it when it fits our holiday schedule and cry over our favorites scenes.  The best times to cry during this movie are as follows: (1) When Susan overhears Kris talking Dutch to the little refugee girl; (2) When Mr. Macy admits under oath on the witness stand that he believes Kris to be Santa Claus; (3) When Susan writes &quot;I believe in you too&quot; on Susan's letter to Kris; (4) When Susan yells, &quot;Stop, Uncle Fred! Stop!&quot; and (5) when Fred sees the cane in the corner. Please feel free to add others to this list as you see fit. Now, excuse me, as I have to go dry my eyes and remember that some films have become holiday classics for good reasons and that remaking something in color does not mean just because it is new it is improved. Happy Turkey Day, everyone!"	5.0	The best movie to watch every Thanksgiving weekend	2002-11-24	48	46	2

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A26EXMDN188M0	Lysan	Had this movie in black & white on VHS ever since it came out and enyoyed it every year. This year, i figured I give the colorized version on DVD a try and I was very surprised how great it showed up on my wide screen TV. As I do have a vision problem due to macula degeneration and can not see everything as clearly as I used to, I was worried that the colors would look more blurry since it's been remade and colorized but this was not the case. I could see the picture as well as any other original color movie or TV in general. I own many Christmas movies, from the old black & white Christmas in Connecticut to the Rankin/Bass animated stories and Tim Allen's Santa Clause 1 - 3. I enjoy them all once a year comes December but Miracle on 34th Street is still my all-time favorite. Edmund Gwenn made the perfect Santa and the rest of the cast played their  parts beautifully. I have been a Maureen O'Hara fan since way back so it's always wonderful to see her again in this charming story. I don't think I have to go into detail about the story itself - many reviews have been left already. Just want to say that this old movie always adds to my spirit for the holdidays!	5.0	My all-time favorite!	2012-12-10	0	0	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A2KI1SGCZT2OEI	"Mark E. Stenroos ""Sibelius fan"""	"My wife and I met in NYC and lived there for many years. While we never joined the Herald Square crowds at 34th & B'way to watch the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, we always went down to Columbus Ave and West 77th to watch them inflate the balloons the evening before, right outside the Natural History Museum. The next day, we'd watch the parade from Central Park West, right near The Dakota (72nd Street) where much of this particular film is set.Because of that, ""Miracle On 34th Street"" holds pride of place with our family as the first Xmas movie we watch every year from our now-always-temperate digs in SoCal - we watch the Macy's Parade on TV (well, at least until the insipid TV hosts send us screaming) and then segue neatly to the film, whose opening scenes are set at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.Personally, I still like the film a lot, even though its theme of ""all you have to do is believe and things come true"" is a bit juvenile...and even after realizing that the whole premise that gets the case against ""Santa"" dismissed is based on the fact that the USPS apparently breaks the law - the very law that had just been read in open court by defense lawyer Fred Gaily only moments before - when they ""illegally"" deliver all of those ""Dear Santa"" letters to the court in which Kris sits as the defendant. I guess one isn't supposed to notice such things when a feel-good story is reaching its climax.The BD comes up very well in its new transfer. Be advised that the BD does NOT contain the colorized version of this film that seems to be so popular. For that, you need to purchase the 2-disc DVD set that was released in 2006. That set gives you a number of extra features that aren't on this single BD as well, including the TV version of the story that was aired on December 14, 1955, and that features Thomas Mitchell (aka Uncle Billy in ""It's A Wonderful Life"") as Kris Kringle, with Teresa Wright as Doris and Macdonald Carey as Fred. This 46-minute version was produced for the ""20th-Century Fox Hour.""Considering the fact that the 1947 Miracle has been an evergreen pretty much since its original theatrical release, one wonders why in the world it has been subjected to numerous updated versions, none of them particularly successful, despite featuring casts that at the time were considered to be quite capable. In addition to the 1955 version that appears on the DVD set mentioned above, these include a 1959 60-minute color TV version starring Ed Wynn as Kris (with Orson Bean as Dr Sawyer and Mary Healy as Doris), a perfectly awful 100 minute TV version from 1973 featuring Sebastian Cabot as Kris, Jane Alexander as Karen (aka Doris) and David Hartman as Fred, and - most recently - an overblown and irritating full-length film ""remake"" from 1994, featuring Richard Attenborough as Kris with the insufferable Mara Wilson as Doris' daughter, Susan.None of them comes close to the freshness and vitality of the 1947 original, so why did they bother?Stick with the original, and in the original B&W; on BD, if you please.Recommended."	5.0	The Miracle Of BluRay	2013-03-10	0	0	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A194PRO1YCIKKE	Mark MacLean	"I was very disappointed with the Blu-ray version of this movie. There is an annoying graininess throughout the film. When I compared it to the 2-disc DVD set we already owned, the DVD was noticeably cleaner and more pleasing to the eye. I guess I would be tempted to assume that this is just an inherent problem with Blu-ray in that it's just so clear that it brings out the grains in the original film, but I also ordered the Blu-ray version of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", and it looks great. This is a classic holiday film, but if you want the best quality version, get the 2 DVD set."	2.0	Blu-ray not as good as DVD	2010-12-19	4	3	1

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A1URXSRV6WDHVY	Marty Gillis	"Miracle on 34th Street is a true classic and a must see each Christmas/Holiday Season.With that said my review will concentrate on the technical issues related to this release rather than the film itself so you can help decide if it is is worth your hard earned cash to upgrade from your current copy, be it VHS or DVD.Miracle on 34th Street comes to you on a BD25 disc with DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 sound (the original Mono is an option for you purists out there) and a small but pleasing amount of extra features. Mine came in an eco case with no slipcover but has nice color printing on both the cover itself and the disc.How does the picture quality on this Blu ray disc compare to the most recent DVD release?  Simply put, it is a noticeable improvement but won't win any transfer of the year awards.  There are NO 'issues' with the transfer other than it being from less than an ideal source. I can not bring myself to believe this was taken from a camera negative, but rather from a previous scan done at a less than ideal resolution.  Don't get me wrong, it looks GREAT and at time shows much fine detail and even depth from time to time.  It just isn't reaching the heights of 'Casablanca' or 'The Maltese Falcon' to name few older B&W; Blu ray titles I own.  I have learned over the last few years that the sharpness of the image has very little to do with the age of the film, but rather the condition of the source used for the scan and whether or not that source was the original negative or 2nd or 3rd generation COPY of that negative.  I have films from the 30's that are razor sharp but they came from a full restored original negative and it shows.The picture is clear and free of almost any print damage. A detected a small amount of telecine wobble but only a few short times and most people probably won't notice it. Both edge enhancement and perceptible DNR has been avoided.  I actually achieved the best visual rendering with a VERY small amount of DNR applied from my Qdeo processor that is built into my Oppo BDP-93 Blu Ra player. Most HDTV's have ""Digital Noise Reduction"" available in their menus and I respectfully suggest a  very small application of it will improve this particular rendering. I am of course splitting hairs here and being way too picky for my own good! Overall, the picture is quite good and a shock to anyone who has only seen this movie on SD TV channels or VHS over the years. It is still a marked improvement over the best DVD as well.The uptick in sound quality is where this Blu Ray truly shines!  There is a nice spacious atmospheric effect created by making use of all 5 channels in this very nice DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 surround mix.  This is NOT an effects movie and as such you may not even notice how all 5 channels are used, but it does add a lovely open sound, crowds are all around you in Macy's and even the elevator sound is more realistic.  People coming in and going out doorways now do so in beautiful stereo. When someone walks across screen their voices pan left or right nicely. Most dialogue is firmly seated in the center channel where it belongs but it is nice to have stereo sound effects, voices and at times music with the added ambiance and depth created by the usage of the rear channels. Not much low frequency info on this title so your sub won't be getting much use, although from time to time the lower notes in the score will be reproduced very nicely through it.The Special features are short and sweet but varied and really compliment the movie. I watched all of them after the feature and never got bored or wanted to FF to the next feature.  It is hard to imagine back in 1947 that this movie would have been described as ""Groovy"" but it WAS and in the films actual trailer too!  (I didn't even know teenagers USED the word ""Groovy"" in the 40's but the proof is right there in the short promo film made by 20th Century Fox back then)  You get two documentaries, a studio promo film , some snippets from the Oscars where Edmund Gwenn wins Best Supporting actor and more. It is a nicely rounded set of extras. You also get a VERY cool movie commentary from Maureen O' Hara , one of the films stars.  As of this writing she is still alive at 91 and has been involved with promotional fan gatherings at Macy's over the years, most recently in the early 2000's.All in all, this is a great Blu Ray presentation that won't disappoint and will continue to provide great entertainment value year after year!

Politics, pop psychology, and commercialism all take a wicked beating... if you are looking for treakly magical endings, you might be surprised at the motives behind what finally 'saves the day.'If you've never seen it, or if you've only seen the 1994 sacharine-sticky-sweet remake, then you must see this movie.  It is great for all ages: the kids will see the heartwarming plot, and the teenagers and adults will understand the delightful cynisism that crops up in the most surprising places.	5.0	Don't let the heartwarming plot fool you...	2004-07-16	11	11	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	There's a reason that almost 60 years later, this durable classic still touches the hearts of filmgoers:  it's beautiful heartwarming story of believing and having faith in others.  Edmund Gwenn deservedly won a supporting actor Oscar for his role as Kris Kringle, a department store Santa who says he really is the jolly old fellow.  Once the nasty corporate psychologist (a delightful Porter Hall) gets hold of Kris, though, we find our Santa facing commitment in a mental home unless lawyer John Payne (a great performance here) can provide legitimate proof that Kris is who he says he is.  The movie is lovingly performed and produced and stands the test of time, and most of  today's Christmas movies pale in comparison.  Maureen O'Hara is a lovely mama; the late Natalie Wood shows her star was shining brightly even at the age of nine; and veteran character actors Gene Lockhart, William Frawley, Thelma Ritter and Jack Albertson all add to the festivities.  Truly one of our finest Christmas movies.	5.0	THE MIRACLE CONTINUES	2005-12-01	3	3	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A13N1OT1727RK5	Michael	I feel like there was never a time that I didn't know MIRACLE ON 34th STREET, so intimately is this wonderful movie connected with the Christmas season. MIRACLE is a richer and more complex film than many take it to be, and it can be enjoyed on more that one level. It is a heart-warming parable of child-like faith overcoming cynicism. It is also a satire on big business, commercialism, psychoanalysis (which was becoming popular in the 1940's), and political machines. For me, the most interesting element of the movie is the subplot involving the psychiatrist, Mr. Sawyer (Porter Hall), who has ambitions of being a psychoanalyst but is stuck in an unfulfilling job giving intelligence tests. He dabbles in Freudian studies on the side and, filled with delusions of grandeur, thinks that he is qualified to psychoanalyze Alfred, an impressionable young boy who works at Macy's. This encroachment on the innocence of children raises the ire of Kris Kringle, the Macy's Santa Claus with delusions of his own; by acting out his anger on Sawyer, he gets himself committed to a sanitarium. That Sawyer is ultimately defeated (when Mr. Macy fires him) is fitting and just, but also - like many villains in classic drama - gives him a hope of redeeming himself. Porter Hall, Gene Lockhart (as the judge), Philip Tonge, William Frawley, Jerome Cowan, Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, and young Natalie Wood all make this movie sparkle; and as for Edmund Gwenn - what can I say? - he IS Santa Claus!	5.0	A Christmas Treasure	2004-12-13	0	0	0

I love B&W; films and would never want to see them colorized such as Casablanca and It's a Wonderful Life. There always are exceptions --- 'Miracle' is a classic Christmas film but not a classic example of B&W; photography. Seeing Santa in color seems right. The colors are actually very muted and the DVD cover picture is not representative of the look unless they have enhanced it since my copy was made.Another old colorized film that I recommend is Laurel and Hardy's March of the Wooden Soldiers/Babes in Toyland. The setting  in Toyland demands color and helps elevates the film. It is one of my favorites.	4.0	Colorized version is the version to watch	2013-12-10	1	1	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A3RLEKKHVJBB5L	mk915	Miracle on 34th Street is not only a classical Christmas movie, but simply a hollywood classic that can never be forgotten.With an all-star cast of Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Edmund Gwenn, and Natalie Wood, this movie shows what good acting and plot are all about.  Oh sure, there's been a remake of this classic like many others, which I haven't seen, but I hear it's not even worth watching because the story is so convoluted.For starters, the acting is great and each actor/actress portrays his/her character extremely well.  The writing is great also in that the lines are never corny and every situation in the movie is meaningful.  But what makes this movie a classic is its acting.  All of the actors/actresses got along very well while filming this movie and it is evident in their performance.  The chemistry between the characters is genuine and really makes the movie come to life.I truly pitty all those who dare say that the remake of this film is just as good or better than the original.  NO REMAKE ever beats classic movies.  I still scratch my head in confusion when directors try to do so.If you're contemplating whether you should buy this movie, don't.  BUY it as soon as you can.  It's a classic and you can preserve it in DVD format.	5.0	The Best Christmas Movie Ever!	2003-11-14	7	6	1

Doris believes that the best way to raise her daughter is to always tell her the truth and not foster any of the childhood fantasies.Doris works at Macy's and it's Thanksgiving Day.  She is in charge of the talent.  And she has a big problem, Santa is drunk.  Luckily the perfect replacement has been found.  A man named Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn), and even better he has his own suit!He is hired to be the store Santa.  There's one problem, he thinks that he is Santa Claus.  Also, he lives out of town.  So Doris' neighbor Fred Gailey (John Payne) decides to let him stay with him.At the store, Kris is a hit.  And a little too good at his job.  A refugee from Europe wants to talk to Santa but she does not speak English, but he speaks her language fluently.  He also sends customers to other stores if the item requested is less expensive.Of course, you need a bad guy.  Kris befriends Alfred, a young boy at Macy's.  When Alfred is told that he is delusional for wanting to be a store Santa, Kris comes to his defense but he looses his temper and raps the psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist has him committed.Susan is upset by this and asks Fred for help.  Fred decides to take go to court.  This leads to a great court battle that is decided by the US Postal Service on Christmas Eve.The ending is truly inspirational.This film is Black and White and should be seen that way.  I know you want see Maureen O'Hara's beautiful red hair but then get The Quiet Man or The Parent Trap.The performances are perfect all around.  Maureen O'Hara is probably the most underrated actress of her time.  This is another wonderful picture perfect performance.  This is Natalie Wood's first major role and she showed why she was a major star until her untimely death.  Edmund Gwenn was a great character actor and this was his crowning role and Oscar winning role.This is a perfect film for the holidays.  It will get the whole family in the holiday spirit.DVD EXTRAS: None	5.0	Christmas Year Round	2006-01-09	2	2	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A2Z9FXHC1L66EW	"Mr. ""alan5973"""	Miracle On 34th Street(1947) is without a doubt one of the best holiday films ever to be brought to the big screen, and has since become a family classic to many people all over.  As its theatrical trailer will atest, Miracle On 34th Street has everything: Comedy, Drama, Surprises, Suspense, Magic, Heart &amp; so much more!The DVD transfer is beautiful!  Nice and sharp and crisp.  Now I'm not someone who has a problem watching Black &amp; White films, but the original Miracle On 34th Street also had a colorized version, derived from a very impressive color transfer using computer technology.  I own this version on VHS (which sadly is out of print) and wondered why 20th Century Fox didn't just include both versions on the DVD?  Trust me, there's plenty of room on the disc for the black &amp; white and the colorized version.  I'll admit, many color versions of black &amp; white films are terrible (It's A Wonderful Life is the perfect example), but I was really impressed with the color version of 'Miracle.  The colors are rich and bright and the detail of the picture is still quite sharp and pristine.  I employ you, 20th Century Fox, to consider giving the public both the color and b&amp;w versions on DVD, just like the original A Christmas Carol(1951) was released (with both versions on one disc).  If both versions are put together, then people can decide for themselves if they want to watch it in black &amp; white or color, and you'll only broaden the films appeal by doing so.

Whoever thinks this is the same color version, be it the AFT color version of the '90's or the bad '80's color version is wrong, this is an excellently color enhanced 2007 version.  I know this for a fact because I watched the '90's A.F.T. version and the new Legend color version side by side as I watched this movie Christmas time 2007.  The new version is sharp, clear, colors are nice and bright (no more brownish or dark reds, the reds are now bright and red red) and the movie now looks like it was originally shot in color.  That's the best complement you can give a colorized movie.  It's beautiful.  Even some colors of things like ties, dresses, scenery background on the wall are different colors now than they were in the '90's color version.  Watching these side by side on a split screen I could see first hand the vast improvements this 2007 version is over the past color versions.  This ain't your Daddy's colorization anymore.

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A18SDN3HYFVH2L	Muzzlehatch	"I suppose I have a stronger memory of this film from childhood than of any other holiday-themed movie, save perhaps A CHRISTMAS CAROL - but there I'm probably remembering at least 2 or 3 versions all sort of mushed together.  The '47 MIRACLE stands alone though, and Edmund Gwenn will forever be Santa Claus to me.The film opens documentary-style, with the camera following an old conventionally-dressed man (Gwenn) down the street in New York, snow falling lightly.  He taps on a window pane - the startled shop employee, fixing up a holiday display of Santa and his reindeer opens the door to see what he wants, only to be remonstrated pleasantly on the proper placement of the toy animals.  You see, this old man knows what he's talking about.  Soon he spots a drunken Santa at the Macy's parade and after upbrading him is replaced - and then hired as the department store's ambassador for the holiday season.  But he's no ordinary pretending elf, as the store's staff psychologist Mr. Sawyer (Porter Hall) finds out - nor is he willing to pretend to the public that Macys is the be-all and end-all of their shopping needs, recommending that customers go elsewhere if they can't find it in Herald Square.If you don't know the rest, well, you should, and I won't spoil it for you.  Suffice it to say that Santa/Kris manages to charm lawyer Fred Gailey (the underrated John Payne) smitten with his neighbor Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara), who happens to be the woman who hired him, and takes on as his special project the re-introduction of the woman's far-too-serious young daughter Susan (Natalie Wood) to worlds of myth, fantasy, and belief.  When Kris's sanity is questioned, and Mr. Sawyer contrives to get him sent to Bellevue, it's up to these three to prove that he is, in fact, the magical spirit he claims to be.Despite the whole story being essentially about belief - about whether one ought to have ""proof"" for everything, about whether things are always as they seem to be - one of the most interesting elements of MIRACLE is the complete lack of religious elements.  Perhaps the word ""God"" is mentioned in passing once or twice; I'm fairly sure ""Jesus"" never is.  Santa Claus here represents human goodness and kindness and generosity - which aren't, after all, specific to Christianity or Christmas.  They're human values belonging to all peoples and all faiths, and the film doesn't reduce it's message to reflect the holiday itself even if the setting reflects it.  One could, I suppose, posit that Doris and Susan's lack of belief in Santa or anything demanding ""faith"" is indicative of a spiritual lack, but the film wisely doesn't push hard on this notion, leaving it up to us to decide just what (besides Santa and childhood games) they might be missing in their lives.The casting is just wonderful - Gwenn won a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar, though I think he's closer to being the lead, and Payne and O'Hara and Wood are all quite fine as well.  Gene Lockhart as the sort-of-principled judge and Philip Tonge as Doris' coworker Mr. Shellhammer nearly steals every scene he's in.  The location work in New York is a pleasant surprise in a film made in this era and certainly lends an air of authenticity; like the opening scene, the Macys parade has a documentary feel to it that isn't typical for the studio-bound productions that were nearly all of Hollywood's output at this time.  The only real problem I have with it is the rather too speedy wrap-up; it's always hard to pull real drama out of a courtroom scene when you know how it's got to end, and the 'evidence' supplied (by both sides) must have seemed rather silly even in 1947.  But no matter - the fantasy elements are always stirring underneath this ostensibly realistic look at the myth, and I still get a kick out of the last shot.

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A1M7M5BJYXH38H	Ninner	"Miracle on 34th Street (Special Edition)This movie is the best one to watch with children that are questioning the reality of Santa, since it gives a foundation to the fact that we can believe in what we want. As they get older, children seem to lean toward the belief that there is no Santa, thus removing the ""fun"" of the holiday. The idea that a big man with a white beard and a jolly laugh will bring you gifts if you are good is a long-time belief that keeps kids wondering, as they try to ""be good"" so they'll get their just rewards. When that belief is gone, the holiday joy is also gone. This movie shows just this.The little girl in the movie is not a believer to begin with, but the arrival of Kris Kringle and events that transpire during the movie have her changing her belief by the end of the movie. The movie plot is enjoyable every year, no matter how many times it's shown on TV. Owning the movie means you won't have to wait until one of the stations decide to show it - you can make that decision yourself!We hope you can have the same enjoyment from this movie that our family has had."	5.0	The oldies can't be beat!	2012-03-15	0	0	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A22CW0ZHY3NJH8	Noname	"This is the ""Miracle on 34th Street"" I remember from childhood.  It is one of my favorite movies of all time and none of the remakes compare.The set includes both the black and white and colorized versions.  The colorized version is the one shown on television, not something new and improved.  The opening scene was grainy and the color was distorted, as if to remind us this is an old movie.  The black and white version is crisp, as it was meant to be shown.  Both versions offer the option to view the movie with the Maureen O'Hara commentary, which she does throughout the movie.I found O'Hara's commentary interesting.  Sometimes, she just described what was happening in the scene, which we could see for ourselves.  Other times, she would describe what it was like to work with an actor or what was happening behind that scene or on the set.  That was a special treat and I sat glued to the set to watch the movie a second time just to hear her talk.""AMC Backstory"" gave a history of the movie and some of the problems behind the set.  I found it fascinating, but I did not like that it was cut into clips and run like on television with all the pauses put in for commercials, except we didn't see any commercials.  Certainly those pauses could have been edited out.Also included are the Thanksgiving day parade footage, promotional shorts and the poster gallery.I was looking forward to the little booklets often inserted into DVD sets, but this set lacks one.  Still, it is a wonderful set."	5.0	Love the extras	2009-11-22	1	1	0

This version includes 2 discs -one with the black & white version and one with the colorized version. It is the story of a skeptical young girl Susan and her mother Doris who runs the Macy's Parade and hires the new store Santa by the name of Kris Kringle. Doris no longer believes in the magic of Christmas but Susan begins to believe that the new Santa is real. The writing and acting are excellent and the characters feel real.This is the perfect movie for a family movie night or for watching while wrapping presents or for a snowy afternoon by the fire.	5.0	My Favorite Christmas Movie	2013-12-16	0	0	0

I love Maureen's story, when she was on the Johnny Carson Show.  Around Christmas time when she was talking with some friends, outside of church, she felt a tug on her coat&#62;. She turned around and had to look down. There was this small child who said, &#34;Are you the lady who knows Santa Claus?&#34; She responded to the child. &#34;Yes I am and I know him very well!&#34; I can just imagine the expression on the child's face!

A little girl who was taught by her mother that 'fairy tales' are just that, and there is no Santa or Easter Bunny or Tooth Fairy, learns to believe in Santa after meeting him.  With the help of a neighbor, played by John Payne, the mother learns to believe too.Lots of drama, humor, and tender scenes.  Will make you believe, too.	5.0	Annual Christmas fare	2013-03-12	0	0	0
6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A32BDJ6JEFSM5X	Paul Dana	&quot;Miracle On 34th Street&quot; is 20th Century-Fox's 1947 Christmas carol.  Much to the surprise of virtually everybody who was involved in that picture, however, it endures today as a parable of faith, of &quot;believing when 'common-sense' tells you you shouldn't.&quot;The question of &quot;Is there a Santa Claus?&quot; is dispensed with in the opening footage of this film (Edmund Gwenn, in a totally-deserved Oscar performance, handles that issue very nicely); &quot;Miracle&quot; concerns itself, rather, with the question of Santa's 'nature,' who he truly is as well as how he operates.&quot;Miracle's&quot; plot is more than slightly complex: it addresses issues beyond the simple question of faith vs. rationale (which it handles, by the way, more than adequately); it likewise turns upon a postwar issue of psychology -- both in Doris Walker's (Maureen O'Hara) Spock-inspired approach to child-rearing, as well as Granville Sawyer's (Porter Hall) 'pop-psyche' analysis of various individuals, which leads to the film's ultimate crisis point -- while also grounding itself in the reality-based world of New York City politics (catch William Frawley's pre-&quot;I Love Lucy&quot; turn as a political fixer as he guides Gene Lockhart's Judge Harper through the court hearings).  There are also some snide, laughing-up-one's-sleeve, references to certain &quot;only slightly-crazy persons . . .  such as artists, composers, and some persons in Washington,&quot; which help to give this film a sense of verisimilitude.Such is the balance which this film achieves -- augmented by the location footage inside Macy's Manhattan store, the 1946 Thanksgiving parade, and various scenes around Manhattan courthouses -- that makes it work.  Much against your will, possibly, you may find yourself beginning to believe in all sorts of wondrous things.And if that's not a bona fide miracle . . .  then it's up to you to tell me what is!	5.0	A Bona Fide Miracle . . . and don't wait 'til December!	2001-12-25	9	9	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A2MJ2LPNNQ7LIP	Phil Berardelli	The year 1947 produced two Christmas tales for the ages, The Bishop's Wife and this one. Though they differ in tone, both reach deeply into human emotions and create experiences that really do border on the miraculous. The story concerns the sudden appearance at Macy's department store in New York City of a man who goes by the name Kris Kringle and claims to be the real Santa Claus. There is conflicting evidence, but Kris (Edmund Gwenn) does seem to have special knowledge about Christmas. And whether he's real or delusional, Mr. Macy (Harry Antrim) wants him on the job because he's getting everyone into the holiday spirit. So it falls upon Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) the store's employee responsible for its annual Thanksgiving Day Parade - whose belief in miracles has been sorely tested by a bad marriage - to host Mr. Kringle for the holiday season. That arrangement brings him into contact with Doris's young daughter Susan (an amazingly good Natalie Wood at 9 years old) and her sympathetic neighbor Fred Gailey (John Payne). Things seem to be going fine when ... well, that's far enough. Just know that the story proceeds to the most delightful courtroom scene ever, and that by the time the movie is over, you just might recover your belief in both Santa and miracles.

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A167CL1OHIBCNR	PonyExpress	"What can be said that hasn't already been eloquently expressed by our fellow Amazon reviewers here?  Not much-but it's ""that time of the year"", I've just ordered the DVD of this classic film, and I can't help adding my two cents to set the goodwill overflowing.One of the very, very few films of this period to actually shoot on location in New York rather than on a studio backlot(fascinating scenes), this original ""Miracle"" is about as far from corny as it's possible to get(it's really the two later versions, one for TV, and one of several years ago, that veer increasingly into phoniness and corn).  There are loads of lessons here for any writer or director who might take on a holiday or ""fantasy"" film: just play it *straight*, don't cuten it up-period.  Every actor plays this wonderfully written screenplay brilliantly-down to the smallest part-a huge reason why, like ""Casablanca"", it's so watchable-over and over again.  John Payne and Maureen O'Hara play two real, live adults who-rare in films-both seem to have ""real"" lives; Maureen works at Macy's, and clearly takes her job seriously, a true professional.  The scenes which begin the story where she's desperately trying to wrangle the annual Macy's parade are almost documentarian-totally believable-and that's what helps make the moonshine of ""the REAL Santa Claus"" showing up work so well.  Quite differently from our current, special-effects-extravanga-fantasies that present to us an art director's idea of exactly how The North Pole, Santa's reindeer, etc.etc. look, this one leaves all that to our imaginations, and the incomparable Edmund Gwenn plays that jolly old soul with a perfect air of mystery and sagacity.  Others have written about Natalie Wood, and she is really unbelievably great.  Smart, natural, somehow turning scenes that could have been a little cringe-making(chewing gum with Kris at bedtime)into honestly charming and un-icky highlights.  That's a result of HER amazing talent.  If she were off by a hair, the film wouldn't be the perfect thing it is.  I should mention the score, by Alfred Newman, which is really masterfully scored-what that man did with ""Jingle Bells""!  You've got to admit along with Susan(Wood)""I believe, I believe, it's silly, but I believe"".  Silly and wonderful."	5.0	Faith, love and Christmas	2004-12-02	9	9	0

This DVD bundle with two DVDs is also great in that it contains the original authentic B&W version as well as a separate DVD with the color version.  We tried the color this year; it was pretty well done.  Next year we'll do the B&W.  There's an audio interview with Maureen O'Hara you can switch on that's available as interjection while the film plays - a creative effort, but as it blocks so much of the dialogue yet is not continuous (i.e. half of the time during the film you hear her interview and half the regular dialogue).

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	ANW7ZQSOJQ2A7	"Richard Muller ""old school audiologist"""	I was only 4 years old when this film came out, and so if my folks took me to see it, I do not remember!  However, in the following years it became a popular film to show at Christmas time, and it richly deserves all the adulation it gets.  I can just see the parents at the beginning of the film thinking: &#34;Uh oh. This is going to be a problem.&#34;  You don't want to lie to your children, but you have to give them something to look forward to, and what better person than a jovial Grandfather figure who hands out gifts of encouragement.  I remember a black period in my younger days when being naughty was NOT a good thing at all!  You don't get rewarded for naughtiness!  As with so many other things, it is the parents responsibility to instuct children in the ways of proper behavior, especially right from wrong.  I do not think that Santa Claus is kept a secret for very long, and it is not too traumatic a thing to let the truth be known &#8212; eventually.The film is so well cast and produced your worries over what the kids will think soon disappear.  John Payne always seemed to be overlooked as a versatile actor, but this was one of his shining moments.  Maureen O'Hara could always light up a film with her beauty and diction.  As for child actors, Natalie Wood shows a remarkable grasp of what is demanded of her, and delivers a very convincing performance.  Of course, none of this matters without Edmund Gwen &#8212; IMHO the best Santa ever!  Throughout all difficulties of having to simply say, &#34;I am who I am&#34;, he convinces us that a straightforward approach is always best.  His simple belief in himself carries over to those he contacts and enriches all their lives &#8212; save for the professed psychiatrist!  And as he says, Christmas is not just a time of the year, but a year-round attitude!  If everyone thought that way, we wouldn't get ourselves in some of the predictaments that we do!&#34;Does Macy tell Gimbel's?&#34; is something you always heard growing up in New York.  So it must have come as quite a shock to theater-goers to see them shaking hands and exchanging customers!  (I confess to having done the very same thing every where I worked in my life.  Wonder where I got the idea from...?)  So many films today try to be clever and fail because they do not have the simple characteristics of films like this.  First of all, a great storyline/screenplay; terrific actors, wonderful direction and a production that sets it apart from films NOT shot like this one &#8212; lots of live stuff and letting people react naturally.  Could this be done today?  Maybe not.  I think it would require some very special, dedicated people and circumstances to carry it off!As for the film that came after this, the re-make starring Mr. Attenborough is certainly very good, but it does not quite have the appeal of the original &#8212; at least not to me.  Re-making a film decades later puts the producers and director in a quandry.  It is ever so hard to re-create the mood/atmosphere/appearance &#8212; whatever you wish to call it &#8212; that it is best to just go for a complete updating of the story.  For this reason so many classics remain just that &#8212; Classic film-making of a story in a certain time.  Consider &#34;The Bishop's Wife&#34;, for comparison.  The remake does not try to be anything more than a facsimile, and in that it succeeds!Getting back to the DVD Special Edition of &#34;Miracle on  34th Street&#34;, the package is just right.  We get a competant colorized version (done in the hues that I feel best reflect the 1940's era) and the original Black & White... We can choose which we wish to see.  I found the colorized version very compelling because of its lack of brilliance or color saturation.  I also own what I consider the best &#34;colorized film&#34; I have yet to see &#8212; &#34;The Mark of Zorro&#34; . (also purchased through Amazon!)  The drama of black & white seems best for some films of that day.  (Once again: &#34;The Bishop's Wife&#34;, &#34;Casablanca&#34;...)As for extras, what more could be asked for than the wonderful Maureen O'Hara giving us a look behind the scenes!  The price being offered by Amazon is a small Christmas Miracle in itself.  And if you order things frequently enough (like I do) then &#34;Prime&#34; makes it even better.  It's hard to convey the 1940's into todays lifestyles and attitudes, but this film should make it easier for Gran dpa and Grandma to explain to the Grandchildren!  Do yourself a favor and get this edition for Christmas this year!  It's lost none of appeal to me over the last 65 years, and I think you might like it as well, given the way the story delivers its message.Hope you and yours enjoy the Happiest of Christmases and a Great New Year!	5.0	It teaches kids a lot about life and having faith in what you believe	2012-12-11	2	2	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	ALD1CRUBY1365	R. L. MILLER	"All the purist noise about ""the abomination of colorization"" notwithstanding, I bought this one FOR that version--I already have the b&w-only; version, so since this repackaging also includes that one as well, I guess I now have a duplicate. In the colorized version, it looks like they overcompensated with the software to avoid making colors too garish, so Edmund Gwenn's Santa suit isn't very red. Plus, the taxicabs you see in the beginning as an out-of-uniform Kringle walks down Fifth Avenue aren't the bright school-bus-yellow you expect on a cab. But we do get to see a green Christmas tree with colored ornaments in the scene towards the end at the Senior home. And when Kringle tries to blow bubbles with the bubblegum he ""mooches"" off Susan, we get to see the resulting pink shreds in his beard. I guess bubblegum was pink as far back as right after World War II. One scene that was only in the book until I watched the ""third version""--the 20th Century Fox 46-minute TV special tucked away in the extras on disc 2--and saw it there. That's the humorous scene where mean-spirited intellectual snob psychologist Sawyer gives a ""debunking-Santa"" lecture, all the while Kringle is peeking around corners and making ironic faces as the audience breaks up laughing and Sawyer doesn't even know he's there. I know that the above evidence as ""pro"" arguments seem flimsy up against the CSX freight train load of ""con"" arguments from anti-colorization purists/ naysayers, but reality check, time out--the colorized version is AVAILABLE, I BOUGHT it and in our society, that's all the justification I need. I'm a CUSTOMER, a VIEWER--part of the AUDIENCE, capisce? In entertainment, non-fans, ""boo birds"", haters and other naysayers don't matter--the REAL AUDIENCE does.Other reviewers have dealt with the principal actors Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Edmund Gwenn and child actress Natalie Wood as well or better than I could, so it's pointless for me to duplicate their efforts. But one supporting player--William Frawley as Judge Harper's political advisor whose cigar is a multi-purpose prop--is a familiar face to me. Part of my childhood TV viewing included ""I Love Lucy"", with Frawley co-starring as Lucy and Ricky's downstairs landlord Fred Mertz. I'm sure when Frawley played the Judge's advisor in this film, he never envisioned tenants ""entertaining"" him with live band versions coming from upstairs of ""The Mexican Hat Dance"", re-badged ""El Breako the Leaso"" a handful of years later."	5.0	Colorization Is NOT an Abomination--It's Why I Bought the Same Movie Twice!	2012-11-19	2	1	1

Very young Natalie Wood sparkles as Susan, who learns to stop being so grown up, and enjoy childhood, with all its wide-eyed wonder.  Edmund Gwenn plays Kris Kringle, and lives the role.  He totally connects with the kiddies who visit &quot;Santa&quot; at Macy's department store.  The brief scene with the little Dutch refugee girl is a definite emotional high point in this movie.  The combined reaction of relief and wonder in the child's face as she visits Santa and finds he speaks her language is memorable.  Gene Lockhart as the harried judge, and William Frawley as his street-wise political advisor provide the needed comic relief to keep the court-room segments from becoming too overwhelmed by lawyers and their tactics.  Even Jack Albertson shows up as an ingenious postal clerk who helps Kringle solve his legal problem.  The on-location scenes filmed on the streets of New York assist the viewer in suspending disbelief.  An enthusiastic cast, crisp direction by George Seaton, a sentimental holiday message, and great humor make this movie a solid holiday treat for the entire family.  Multiple viewing only enriches the rewards.  Beware remakes!  ;-)	5.0	Yes, Susie, there is a Santa Claus.	2000-11-28	81	75	6
6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A38ZI9LAUWID41	Robert Shanahan	I prefer the original black and white version of this film but the colored version makes for a nice change on occasion. This particular package has both versions, as well as a number of extra features that the Blu-Ray doesn't offer, which is why I purchased this package. This film is on the same level as It's A Wonderful Life in that no matter how many times you've seen it, you look forward to seeing it again because it is a classic. I highly recommend Miracle on 34th Street regardless of what version you prefer.	5.0	Classic Movie Color or Black and White	2013-05-30	0	0	0
6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A4UGMKUSX9XHI	Robert Stone	"If you are reading this review you likely already know and love this classic movie. Since I grew up with this version, I do prefer it to the newest remake although that one is well done, too. In any case, if you have never seen this one just save yourself some time, stop reading this, and buy it!What you are probably interested in is the quality of the blu-ray. I have seen this movie many times on TV and on prior DVD release and this blu-ray is certainly the best presentation I have seen. That said, it did not ""blow me away"" the way the remaster ofIt's a Wonderful Life [Blu-ray] did. The picture just looks a little bit muted with whites not quite white and the whole picture just tending toward being a bit dark. The level of detail also does not match what I have seen on other blu-rays.I did some searching on the internet and on blu-ray.com did confirm that this is a new scan in HD since I was not even certain of that by watching it - and that site also noted limitations might well be related to the source material - and that is likely the case. I did not have a chance to compare it to a prior DVD - I'll be honest, I couldn't find it! As my wife would/will say, time to tidy up and organize DVDs! if I locate the DVD I'll compare directly and post an update.It is important to note this film is presented in the correct aspect ratio - this means that if you watch it on a wide screen TV then black bars at the sides are present which are normal and proper. It is also notable that the colorized version is NOT included if that was of interest to you. Prior reviewers were very upset about that but as of this writing the currently shipping case does not claim that a colorized version is included and the Amazon listing appears to have been updated as well.All in all though I am not awestruck by this disc it still gets 5 stars as a wonderful classic movie and likely the best transfer possible from limited source material. I am looking forward to sharing it with my 5 and 7 year old kids!"	5.0	Miracle on 34th Street Blu-Ray	2010-11-19	7	7	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A12IDQSS4OW33B	Robin Goodfellow	"""MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET"" is the closest thing to a christmas classic you will ever see on this planet. I loved it when I saw it. Edmund Gwenn is PERFECT as Santa. In fact, I think this film is a great classic. If you're ever stuck with absolutely NOTHING to do one wintery-like, and a very low temperatured day, and you are inside with no fire goin' in a fireplace, watch this. And to remember something useful for a review like this, read the title of this review a second time.

It shows how a young girl is led to believe by her mother that there is no such thing as Santa Clause. The girl and the mother eventually find out the true meaning of Christmas with the help of a old gentleman claiming to be Santa Clause and the laywer next door.The movie shows how us that even then and now how much Christmas is commercialized and takes away from the true meaning of Christmas. In the gift of love to family,friends and loved ones,and the exchanging of gifts. A feel good movie though in excellent respects for the young and old to watch. The remake is good too in it's own.	5.0	Miracle On 34th Street  Original	2007-01-09	0	0	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A1OX82JPAQLL60	rodboomboom	Having many holiday seasons watched or tried to find it on the seasonal plays on the tele, chose to purchase our own copy.The storyline is solid and acting is good for the times.  The integrity of Kringle and Doris and Susan (can you say Natalie Wood! how neat!)et al is very good.  It makes for great viewing.  Neat really to go back and understand the cultural climate at its making.  Very much more wholesome attitude going on here.The psychogist (William Frawley) is excellent as well.  The miracle of the story is fantassy alright, but this is its charm and the charm of the times --- not our nowadays stuckness on blood and guts and supercreatures, etc.  Kids as they get older certainly can be exposed to the truth about Nick, but when younger, this can be a fun time for their rising imagination.Thoroughly enjoyable.	5.0	Great Christmas Tradition	2004-02-09	0	0	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	AM2PV53UX1JEQ	R. Penola	For anyone who ever experienced the joys of Christmas anywhere, specifically in the wonderment and magic of Santa Claus, and all that he represents, this movie delivers the goods in a major way.  I love the way  this movie has aged -- its black and white New York, with a Macy's that you  can practically smell, paint a quaint, innocent time, and populate that  time with characters that still have a contemporary freshness to them --  Maureen O'Hara, who is deliciously self-aware, tells her little girl there  are no such things as fairy tales -- having a bitter heart from a man who  has obviously abandoned her.  It is her heart, and little Natalie Wood's  (who is amazingly precocious and adorable) that Edmund Gwynn must melt by  the time Christmas Eve rolls around.  The simplest of plots, with a lovely  cornball quality, tumbles forth with warmth and amusement.  And it is again  the things we do not see but imagine -- as when Kris tells Maureen outside  of Macy's, the 34th Street sign hovering above them -- that he must be on  his way; it is Christmas Eve after all -- that give it a special layer of  Christmas fantasy.  I dearly love this movie, and virtually every remake  pales in comparison.  Gwynn will make you believe -- he justifiably won the  Oscar playing Kris Kringle.	5.0	SANTA LIVES	1999-12-17	10	10	0

She's adorable and Maureen O'Hara (normally of the John Wayne counterpart roles), is wonderful as the disbelieving mother whose heart and mind slowly opens to love, possibility, miracles and goodness. There's a modern version too (think it was made in the 1990s) but this is simpler and well done. Nothing you wouldn't want your child to see. If anything, it will help them believe in Santa as a possibility a bit longer. Good for all- heart warming.	5.0	The Second-best family Xmas Classic!	2014-01-05	0	0	0

As Santa himself, Edmund Gwenn gives his  beautiful Oscar - winning portrayal while John Payne and Maureen O'Hara are fine in their roles......... The actual Kris Kringle is hired as Santa for the Macy's Thanksgiving parade but finds difficulty in proving himself to the cynical parade sponsor. When the boss's daughter also refuses to acknowledge Kringle, he goes to extraordinary lengths to convince her. A holiday classic equal in classic status to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE with Gwenn and Wood especially engaging.

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A2LE8XKC6BXU1C	Simone Wilson	"There are some movies, despite their faults, that will never lose their place in America's heart.  Turn on your television up to two months before December 25th, and chances are you'll see a miniature Natalie Wood (who later starred in both West Side Story and Rebel Without a Cause) gazing into the twinkly eyes of a dwarfed and frighteningly jolly ""Santa Claus"" (Edmund Gwenn), telling him sternly that she does not believe he is really Kris Kringle.  You've stumbled upon one of the most famous holiday flicks in history: Miracle on 34th Street, filmed in glorious black and white.After 97 minutes of sugary, cheerful simplicity, little Susan (Natalie Wood) and the rest of New York has been convinced that Macy's Santa Claus is indeed the real thing--the crafty old man even tricks the United States government into believing in him.  As you can see, this is not the most realistic of all stories... though definitely optimistic in its assumption that the Supreme Court has the compassion to rule that reindeers can fly for the mere sake of saving a dying lunatic.Maureen O'Hara, who plays Susan's mom, does an awful job as an actress.  Every woman over the age of 50 will probably dismiss my naive judgment of their former idol, but, like most bad actresses of her day, I think O'Hara is over dramatic and extremely unrealistic.  In this way, her performance reflects the entire movie--very cute, yes, but leaving you with a sickeningly sweet aftertaste similar to that which can be obtained from listening to an entire album of sappy ""White Christmas"" remakes."	3.0	don't be angry..this is from viewpoint of younger generation	2003-12-05	44	3	41

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A16QJ649N8PRV	S. Peek	This has long been a favorite of many at Christmas time.  It is a great production.This timeless classic features Edmund Gwenn as Kris Kringle.  This kindly old man is employed to play Santa Claus at the Macy's department store in New York.  He creates quite a stir in the job and it is apparent that he really believes that he is Santa Claus.  Some who do not accept this identity seek to have him committed to a mental facility.There are some classic courtroom scenes with the presiding judge put in the untenable position of possibly ruling that Kringle is not really St. Nick.  He faces great unpopularity even with his own family members, let alone the voters.This is really a fun flick.  It is well done and has some great subplots.  Two well known actresses who play in it are Maureen O'Hara and a very young Natalie Wood.  If you have not seen it already, you will likely enjoy it.  If you have watched it before, this is one that can be pleasantly viewed again.	4.0	A Christmas Classic	2009-01-01	0	0	0

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A2F7XTL4KHDZME	Stephen Reginald	"After It's A Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street is probably the most popular of all the films shown around the Christmas season, and for good reason.  The story begins with the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.  An exasperated Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) is the young Macy's executive in charge of the details of organizing the parade.  When the man hired to play Santa Claus on one of the parade floats turns up stone drunk, a kindly bearded gentleman (Edmund Gwenn) fills in as Santa, saving the day.  Gwenn's performance in the parade is so authentic, that Macy's offers him a job as their department store Santa, to the delight of both children and adults.  There's only one problem, Gwenn thinks he really is Kris Kringle, i.e., Santa Claus!  This ""dilemma"" presents serious problems for Mrs. Walker and her associate, Mr. Shellhammer (Philip Tonge), who realize what an asset and public relations ambassador Kris is for Macy's, but fear he may act out his ""latent maniacal tendencies"" as predicted by  quack store psychologist Mr. Sawyer (Porter Hall).  The plot thickens when apartment neighbor Fred Gailey (John Payne) takes notice of Mrs. Walker and her young daughter Susan (Natalie Wood).  A promising young attorney, Payne tries to win over first daughter Wood, before charming his way into O'Hara's life.  Due to a seemingly bitter divorce when Wood was a baby, O'Hara has shut down emotionally.  She refuses to let her daughter believe in any fantasies of any kind, including the childhood belief in Santa Claus.  It is her belief that parents must always be truthful with their children so they won't grow up to believe in fairy tale happy endings only to be disappointed by reality, which is revealed to be her own life experience.  Payne on the other hand thinks that it's a good thing for children to fantasize while they are young and to believe in fairy tales and the like...even to believe in Santa Claus.  This major difference of opinion when it comes to raising children becomes a real conflict for the two.  One thing leads to another and before you know it, Kris Kringle is on trial for lunacy with Payne defending him as the one and only Santa Claus.  Even though this film was released in 1947, its theme of believing in something larger than ourselves still holds true.  O'Hara's role as a working single mom is even more in tune with today's reality than in 1947.  She comes off as a competent, intelligent woman who is doing the best she can to raise her young daughter.  A wonderfully enchanting movie with great performances from all the players, but the real star is Edmund Gwenn in his Academy Award winning role as Kris Kringle.  His kind and gentle performance could convince anyone that he really is Santa Claus.  A young Natalie Wood also shines as O'Hara's daughter and her scenes with Gwenn are natural and real.  Filled with many memorable scenes (including  the first glimpse of the great character actress Thelma Ritter) including my favorite:  Kris speaking Dutch to a young war orphan who doesn't speak English while her adoptive mother looks on in amazement.  In addition to the Oscar won by Gwenn, Miracle won two additional statues for Best Original Story (Valentine Davies) and Best Screenplay (George Seaton).  Miracle on 34th Street deserves its well-earned reputation as a Christmas classic."	5.0	Believe in Miracles	2000-12-12	12	11	1

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	AQQLWCMRNDFGI	Steven A. Peterson	"It's Christmas Day as I am writing this review, so what better thing to do than to review one of the classic Christmas movies!  This is an emotional movie, pulling all the right strings to get the audience's predictable response.  And it works well!  This is, for what it's worth, in my judgment, the preferred Christmas movie.It has many different components that make the overall production work.  First, the cast.  The lead players are well portrayed, with John Payne as the idealistic attorney, Maureen O'Hara as the flinty, pragmatic non-nonsense mother of the ""too grown up for her age"" Natalie Wood, acting early in her career.  Other actors fill out the cast nicely, with William Frawley as a hard-boiled political operative to the judge, Gene Lockhart, who will preside over the court case that serves as the climax of the movie.Second, the plot line is crisply laid out and moves along nicely.  A drunk Santa Claus at Macy's is replaced by Edmund Gwenn, who calls himself Kris Kringle.  His behavior is at first thought harmful to the store--but redounds to Macy's benefit.  Then, he is accused of being mentally incompetent because of his belief that he is, in fact, Santa Claus. John Payne, who has become close to O'Hara's character, takes Kris Kringle's case to court.  There, the befuddled judge has to make some politically charged decisions.  Such as: Is there a real Santa Claus?  If so, is Kris him?  The US Post Office plays a key role in the outcome, and there is a happy ending--with a special nice touch, with the last lines being film classics.So, yes, there is a contrived element to this movie; yes, it pulls strings on the audience; yes, the ending is a bit schmaltzy.  But, yes, this is a wonderful movie and deserves to be telecast each holiday season.  A genuine classic!"	5.0	A holiday classic!	2007-12-24	3	3	0
6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A1S6U42368WJQE	"Steven Daedalus ""Steve"""	"John Payne and Maureen O'Hara manage to prove that an old and bearded codger, Edmund Gwenn, who has been hired by Macy's Department Store in New York to play Santa Claus during the Christmas season, is actually Santa Claus, aka Kris Kringle. Natalie Wood is the skeptical little daughter of divorced O'Hara. Payne is a lawyer who works at a white shoe firm.This will warm the cockles of your heart. It ends happily, with Payne and O'Hara finding each other and Wood won over to a belief in Santa Claus, or at least the power of will.There are a few minor problems. I found out there was no Santa Claus early in life, around the age of thirty-five, when I took a look at my first paycheck. And later, when I tried to plead not guilty by reason of mental defect. And, as if that weren't enough, a few weeks into my marriage was enough to convince me. We might as well face head on the fact that life is full of pain. Every realist knows this. The doctor even slaps the newborn baby, except in the case of more than usually ugly babies when he slaps the mother.No. I'm afraid O'Hara and her daughter may have had the right take on life as materialists. Our lives are determined by our circumstances or, as the famous philosopher Brillat-Savarin put it, ""Dis-moi ce que tu manges, je te dirai ce que tu es."" I don't know what it means but it sounds as if it had to do with some kind of material.Now, John Payne is a hoax of a different color. Unable to recognize an epiphenomenon when he sees one, he insists that fantasies are essential to our lives. He doesn't explain why. He just assumes it, with a snap of his mental fingers.He quits his job at a prestigious New York law firm in order to defend Santa Claus in court. Right. And where is John Payne now, you ask? I recently saw him wrapped in a couple of filthy blankets on a bench in Sheridan Square. Don't try to kid a kidder.Edmund Gwenn does a fine job in the role but he isn't Santa. Edmund Gwenn, as a matter of fact, is a psychopath who tried to push the innocent reporter Joel McCrea off the tower of a London church in ""Foreign Correspondent."" Now he shows up as Santa Claus and we're asked to believe him? In this enshrinement of idealism, he sucks poor little Natalie Wood into his fantasy world of reindeer and North Poles and ritual reciprocity and all that. I won't deny that, fifteen years after this release, Natalie Wood began to play a part in my fantasy life too -- but what does that have to do with the venomous message this movie propounds? Nothing at all -- and let's get our minds out of the gutter, shall we?The lissotrichous Maureen O'Hara is attractive, polite but tough as carbon steel underneath all that winsome pulchritude. Well, maybe not so hard in the end. Maureen O'Hara might be spirited if the role called for it but never tough."	4.0	Warms The Cockles Of Your Heart.	2011-12-29	1	0	1

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	AAT03UTMUILVQ	Timothy J. Egan	"The movie was entertaining alright, however I see this particular production as the singular ""event"" that eclipsed the real reason for the celebration of Christmas with this fictitious character in red over the Prince of Peace. After this film became a ""classic"", Christmas had hardly anything to do with the birth of Jesus. In fact, the idea of Jesus became little more than a boring token amid the fun and frah-la la-lic of buying and selling unneeded items and obligatory work-place ""parties"". There were some elements in the movie that dealt with the ongoing crisis of rampant commercialism, but underneath, it might have only served to add further fuel to the mass-corporatization of this annual festival of grotesque materialism. Why honor historical figures of Justice when we have soft, fabled characters that only pretend to honor the idea of charity and mercy? Overall, this movie is a blasphemy against Christ and the true spirit of rebirth.  As for Natalie Wood, her death/possible murder remains willfully unsolved."	3.0	Well acted film	2013-12-18	2	0	2

The colorized version is reasonably vivid without being harsh on the eyes. The B&W version is a near-perfect restoration. The TV version is a nice bit of retro-media history. The interviews with Miss O'Hara are fascinating....boy, talk about someone who has aged so gracefully. The rest of the special features are a great insight into Hollywood history and studio marketing just before the beginning of the TV era.

I finally decided to get this, but am perplexed as to why the extra colourised version was ever considered.  Of course I won't watch that disc because it is a crime to do that to films of that era, or for that matter to edit any work of film or animation from its original presented form.  This is why I won't buy any of the animated Christmas shows from the 60's, Rudolph, Grinch, etc.  I've heard too many things about how/what has been removed.  It is nice that &#34;Miracle on 34th Street&#34; is as complete as I remember, and as far as I know.  The extras on this DVD are quite nice as well.  The rest speaks for itself.

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A2UWT1X23S26WE	Willa Scott	With its clever, moving script and wonderful performances this remains the classic version of the tale of the department store Santa who maybe really is Santa--depending on your point of view. Edmund Gwenn is terrific as the old guy and the young Natalie Wood (who apparently really believed he was Santa during the filming) is the perfect little skeptic-turned believer. As well as the original black and white film this set includes the colorized version(forget that)and interesting background features, including an interview with Irish actress Maureen O'Hara, who played Natalie Wood's mother.	5.0	This is the classic	2007-12-28	6	5	1

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A2WMTWT0S3PBLU	William B. Storey	I hestitate to buy this dvd because I bought the vhs thinking i was getting the original theatrical release. I didn't. I got the version I see on TNT every Thanksgiving. The version that is cut up from years past. People always write that the part they love is when Maureen O'Hara and John Payne find Kris's cane by the fire place in the house for sale. For me the part that makes the movie is always cut. Tommy Mera is just done with his testimony in court and asks Kris on his way out of court for an offical football helmut and Kris says OK. After the happy resolution of the trail Maureen O'Hara ask Kris to dinner party, but Kris says it is Christmas Eve. The next scene should be the Mera house Christmas morning and Tommy getting his football helmut and mom and dad saying I didn't get it while Tommy is wearing this over sized football helmut. Until I see a completely restored version I will not buy the dvd.	2.0	I hesitate to buy the dvd	2003-12-07	44	29	15

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A2LLFSWCZQJ7HR	William Jennings	There are three Christmas movies That I consider &#34;essential&#34; (1947) at The Christmas holidays.  &#34;Miracle on 34th Street&#34; Is the first of these along with &#34;It's a wonderful life and almost any version of &#34;A Christmas carol&#34;  There are many others I like and watch.  However, these three always make me feel the gift of giving, love and peace in my heart.Miracle on 34th Street also reminds me that at one time when I was young people still cared about their fellow man if only at Christmas time.  It is my all time feel good movie.	5.0	Essential Christmas Movies	2012-12-11	0	0	0

It was fun to watch on computer, but I don't own a Kindle or other such device.  Does Amazon sell the DVD?  Is there a way I can convert/download this &#34;owned&#34; movie to my own DVD disc?

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A347MRCA48RV4J	wiser consumer	I've watched this movie forever it seems and now have it in a colorized version that couldn't be better, unless the whole thing were to materialize in flesh and blood, bricks and mortar. In the colorized version, they've done it in a sepia tone/color effect that closely approximates the tones used in graduation photos during the 50s when I graduated and, therefore, seems appropriate for the period.But for those purists who believe the original must be maintained, there's the black-and-white version to satisfy their preferences. My approach to that argument is black-and-white may have been chosen to suit a budget but we see in color, so why not have it that way if possible. Granted, some movies are shot in black-and-white to instill a mood; Citizen Kane and Psycho come to mind. But Kafka was shot in both in different places to achieve the desired effect.Whichever, I wholeheartedly endorse this combination presentation. Well done.	5.0	Couldn't be better	2012-09-02	2	2	0

But please, if you (the studio) are not going to bother doing a decent job of colorizing, then DON'T!Luckily of course, this special edition has the original B&W; version, which is what we all remember and love.	4.0	Skip the colorized version please!	2007-12-03	7	3	4

6301442962	Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]	A2B8GXSCB1R05T	Zack Davisson	Like many households, for me Christmas movies are as much a part of the tradition as trees and presents.  &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; &quot;White Christmas,&quot; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; the Rankin/Bass Animagics and &quot;Miracle on 34th Street.&quot;  This Holiday classic is a nice DVD, with good quality and restored black and white.  The bonus features are slim to none, containing only a movie trailer and a talent file.With Ed Gwen and Natalie Woods playing both sides of the coin, &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; is a film of charming, wide-eyed cynicism.  What place does Santa Claus have in the modern world?  What place does belief and trust have in a world where Santa shows up to work drunk and Christmas is a headache to every retail and postal worker in America?Gimbels may be long gone, but I am glad that &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; has persisted.  Perhaps the message of the film has more staying power than the corporations that would commandeer Christmas.Like Mr. Macy says, &quot;You cannot argue with success.&quot;	5.0	I believe in Santa Claus	2002-12-08	7	7	0
